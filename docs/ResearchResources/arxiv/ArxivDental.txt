Atherosclerotic carotid plaques on panoramic imaging: an automatic detection using deep learning with small dataset (Lazar Kats - 24 August, 2018)
As these are one of the most common images performed for routine dental practice, they can be used as a source of available data for computerized methods of automatic detection in order to significantly increase timely diagnosis of ACPs. We aimed to assess the operation of the algorithm on a small database of 65 panoramic images. ACP was detected with a sensitivity of 75%, specificity of 80% and an accuracy of 83%. The ROC analysis showed a significant Area Under Curve (AUC) difference from 0.5

A Tensor Factorization Method for 3D Super-Resolution with Application to Dental CT (Janka Hatvani - 26 July, 2018)
In contrast to this comparative technique, the proposed reconstruction technique gives a 2-order-of-magnitude improvement in running time -- 2 minutes compared to 2 hours for a dental volume of 282$\times$266$\times$392 voxels

Automatic segmenting teeth in X-ray images: Trends, a novel data set, benchmarking and future perspectives (Gil Jader - 8 February, 2018)
This review presents an in-depth study of the literature on segmentation methods applied in dental imaging. We found that the literature has primarily focused on threshold-based segmentation methods (54%). 80% of the reviewed papers have used intra-oral X-ray images in their experiments, demonstrating preference to perform segmentation on images of already isolated parts of the teeth, rather than using extra-oral X-rays, which show tooth structure of the mouth and bones of the face. A statistical comparison of the results found with the 10 image segmentation methods over our proposed data set comprised of 1,500 images is also carried out, providing a more comprehensive source of performance assessment

Robust and fully automated segmentation of mandible from CT scans (Neslisah Torosdagli - 22 February, 2017)
Despite heavy CT artifacts and dental fillings, consisting half of the CT image data in our experiments, we have achieved highly accurate detection and delineation results. Specifically, detection accuracy more than 96% (measured by union of intersection (UoI)), the delineation accuracy of 91% (measured by dice similarity coefficient), and less than 1 mm in shape mismatch (Hausdorff Distance) were found.

Computer Aided Detection of Oral Lesions on CT Images (Shaikat Galib - 29 November, 2016)
In this study, a fully automatic method to detect oral lesions in mandibular region from dental CT images is proposed. The results were validated using a CT dataset of 52 patients, where 22 patients had abnormalities and 30 patients were normal. Using non-training dataset, CB detection algorithm yielded 71% sensitivity with 0.31 false positives per patient. Furthermore, OB detection algorithm achieved 100% sensitivity with 0.13 false positives per patient

A Statistical Modeling Approach to Computer-Aided Quantification of Dental Biofilm (Awais Mansoor - 9 July, 2014)
Several methods to quantify dental biofilm coverage have recently been reported in the literature, but at best they provide a semi-automated approach to quantification with significant input from a human grader that comes with the graders bias of what are foreground, background, biofilm, and tooth. Additionally, human assessment indices limit the resolution of the quantification scale; most commercial scales use five levels of quantification for biofilm coverage (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%)

Learning Beyond Human Expertise with Generative Models for Dental Restorations (Jyh-Jing Hwang - 30 March, 2018)
In the dental industry, it takes a technician years of training to design synthetic crowns that restore the function and integrity of missing teeth. We develop a fully automatic approach that learns not only from human designs of dental crowns, but also from natural spatial profiles between opposing teeth
