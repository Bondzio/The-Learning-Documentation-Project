An Adaptable Maturity Strategy for Information Security (Gliner Dias Alencar - 16 July, 2018)
However, the implementation of policies, actions, and adjustment to such standards is not simple and must be addressed by specific needs identified by the Information Security Governance in each organization. For this, a survey was used as the main methodological instrument, reaching 157 distinct companies. As a result, it was possible to classify the ISO/IEC 27001 and 27002 controls in four stages according to the importance given by the companies

Performance Evaluation of a Deployed 4G LTE Network (E. T. Tchao - 1 April, 2018)
In Ghana and many countries within Sub-Sahara Africa, Long Term Evolution (LTE) is being considered for use within the sectors of Governance, Energy distribution and transmission, Transport, Education and Health. This paper evaluates the performance of some selected key network parameters of a newly deployed LTE network in the 2600 MHz band operating in the peculiar Sub-Saharan African terrain under varied MIMO Antenna Configurations. However, the percentage coverage for users under the 2x2 MIMO simulation scenario was better than that of the adaptive 4x4 MIMO configuration with 2x2 MIMO achieving 60.41% of coverage area having throughput values between 1 - 40Mbps as against 55.87% achieved by the 4x4 MIMO configuration in the peculiar deployment terrain.

Citation Analysis of Innovative ICT and Advances of Governance (2008-2017) (Shuhua Monica Liu - 24 January, 2018)
To understand benefits and challenges associated with this initiative worldwide, we conducted analyses on research articles published in the e-governance area between 2008 and 2017. Content analysis and citation analysis were performed on 2105 articles to address three questions: (1) What types of new ICT have been adopted in the IPG initiative in the past decade? (2) How did scholars investigate interactions between the new ICTs and governance core to IPG? (3) How did the new ICTs interact and shape while also being shaped by the evolution of governance in the past decade? Our analysis suggests that IPG initiative has enriched the government information infrastructure

Role OF Web 2.0 IN E-Governance (Monica Prajapati - 20 June, 2014)
The aim of the paper is to study the role of Web 2.0 in E-Governance and the various benefits that has been achieved through it. We have reviewed existing state-of-the-art Web 2.0 applications and E-Governance initiatives related with Web 2.0. We have included case studies to support the proposition that use of Web 2.0 can enhance the participation of citizens in E-Governance initiatives in an interactive manner. This paper proposes that many of the government organizations can exploit the benefits of Web 2.0 and hence can leverage its flexibility and interactive nature. The use of Web 2.0 applications can also bring out the transparency in the government affairs. The paper had surveyed few organizations which are using Web 2.0 tools to enhance their operations.

Collection security management at university libraries: assessment of its implementation status (A. A. Maidabino - 22 January, 2013)
A "house" model was proposed consisting of five factors; collection security governance, operations and processes, people issues, physical and technical issues and the security culture in libraries. An assessment instrument listing items covering the five factors was pilot tested on 61 samples comprising chief librarians, deputy librarians, departmental, sectional heads and professional staff working in four university libraries in Nigeria. Reliability tests indicate that all five factors are reliable with Cronbach's alpha values between 0.7 and 0.9, indicating that the instrument can be used for wider distribution to explore and assess the level of collection security implementation in university libraries from a holistic perspective.
