Why scatter plots suggest causality, and what we can do about it (Carl T. Bergstrom - 25 September, 2018)
Whether we look at functions of one variable in pure mathematics, plots of experimental measurements as a function of the experimental conditions, or scatter plots of predictor and response variables, the value plotted on the vertical axis is by convention assumed to be determined or influenced by the value on the horizontal axis. Diamond plots are essentially 45 degree rotations of ordinary scatter plots; by visually jarring the viewer they clearly indicate that she should not draw the usual distinction between independent/predictor variable and dependent/response variable

Gender differences in research areas and topics: An analysis of publications in 285 fields (Mike Thelwall - 4 September, 2018)
Prior research suggests that the imbalances between science, technology, engineering and mathematics fields may be partly due to greater male interest in things and greater female interest in people, or to off-putting masculine cultures in some disciplines. To seek more detailed insights across all subjects, this article compares practising US male and female researchers between and within 285 narrow Scopus fields inside 26 broad fields from their first-authored articles published in 2017

Quantum Random Self-Modifiable Computation (Michael Stephen Fiske - 21 September, 2018)
Among the fundamental questions in computer science, at least two have a deep impact on mathematics. In 1936, Alan Turing posed the halting problem for Turing machines and proved that this problem is unsolvable for Turing machines. --> X_m, so at the mth stage ex-machine X_m can correctly determine for 0 <= i <= m whether M_i's execution on tape T_i eventually halts? We demonstrate an ex-machine Q(x) that has one such evolutionary path. The existence of this evolutionary path suggests that David Hilbert was not misguided to propose in 1900 that mathematicians search for finite processes to help construct mathematical proofs

Improving QED-Tutrix by Automating the Generation of Proofs (Ludovic Font - 4 March, 2018)
Mathematics in general, and geometry in particular, provide interesting challenges when developing educative softwares, both in the education and  computer science aspects. It focuses on specific goals: 1) to allow the student to freely explore the problem and its figure, 2) to accept proofs elements in any order, 3) to handle a variety of proofs, which can be customized by the teacher, and 4) to be able to help the student at any step of the resolution of the problem, if the need arises. This automation must follow fundamental constraints in order to create problems compatible with QED-Tutrix: 1) readability of the proofs, 2) accessibility at a high school level, and 3) possibility for the teacher to modify the parameters defining the "acceptability" of a proof

P?=NP as minimization of degree 4 polynomial, plane or sphere intersection with $\{0,1\}^n$, integration or Grassmann number problem (Jarek Duda - 19 September, 2018)
While the P vs NP problem is mainly approached form the point of view of discrete mathematics, this paper proposes reformulations into the field of abstract algebra, geometry, fourier analysis and of continuous global optimization - which advanced tools might bring new perspectives and approaches for this question. The first one is equivalence of satisfaction of 3-SAT problem with the question of reaching zero of a nonnegative degree 4 multivariate polynomial (sum of squares), what could be tested from the perspective of algebra by using discriminant. Reducing to degree 2 polynomial plus constraints of being in $\{0,1\}^n$, we get geometric formulations as the question if plane or sphere intersects with $\{0,1\}^n$. There will be also discussed a looking promising algebraic/geometric approach to the graph isomorphism problem - tested to successfully distinguish strongly regular graphs for up to 29 vertices.

This principle has been adapted to many different contexts, and in particular we are interested in its most common version for arithmetic, which can be stated as "given a total recursive function f , if it is impossible that there is no n for which f(n) = 0, then there exists an n such that f(n) = 0"

Namely, we prove that for every subset $X$ of vertices of a $Î´$-hyperbolic graph $G$ there exists a vertex $m$ of $G$ such that the disk $D(m,4 Î´)$ of radius $4 Î´$ centered at $m$ intercepts at least one half of the total flow between all pairs of vertices of $X$, where the flow between two vertices $x,y\in X$ is carried by geodesic (or quasi-geodesic) $(x,y)$-paths

On optimal approximability results for computing the strong metric dimension (Bhaskar DasGupta - 20 October, 2016)
The strong metric dimension of a graph was first introduced by SebÃ¶ and Tannier (Mathematics of Operations Research, 29(2), 383-393, 2004) as an alternative to the (weak) metric dimension of graphs previously introduced independently by Slater (Proc. 6th Southeastern Conference on Combinatorics, Graph Theory, and Computing, 549-559, 1975) and by Harary and Melter (Ars Combinatoria, 2, 191-195, 1976), and has since been investigated in several research papers. In this communication, we show that the problem of computing the strong metric dimension of a graph of $n$ nodes admits a polynomial-time $2$-approximation, admits a $O^\ast\big(2^{\,0.287\,n}\big)$-time exact computation algorithm, admits a $O\big(1.2738^k+n\,k\big)$-time exact computation algorithm if the strong metric dimension is at most $k$, does not admit a polynomial time $(2-\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm assuming the unique games conjecture is true, does not admit a polynomial time $(10\sqrt{5}-21-\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm assuming P$\neq$NP, does not admit a $O^\ast\big(2^{o(n)}\big)$-time exact computation algorithm assuming the exponential time hypothesis is true, and does not admit a $O^\ast\big(n^{o(k)}\big)$-time exact computation algorithm if the strong metric dimension is at most $k$ assuming the exponential time hypothesis is true.

Application of Multilayer Feedforward Neural Networks in Predicting Tree Height and Forest Stock Volume of Chinese Fir (Xiaohui Huang - 20 May, 2014)
Previous studies used mathematics models to describe complex growing pattern of forest stand, in order to determine the dynamic status of growing forest stand in multiple conditions. Results show that Multilayer Feedforward Neural Networks with 4 nodes (MLFN-4) can predict the tree height with the lowest RMS error (1.77); Multilayer Feedforward Neural Networks with 7 nodes (MLFN-7) can predict the forest stock volume with the lowest RMS error (4.95)

Efficient Mixed-Norm Regularization: Algorithms and Safe Screening Methods (Jie Wang - 15 July, 2013)
Sparse learning has recently received increasing attention in many areas including machine learning, statistics, and applied mathematics. The mixed-norm regularization based on the l1q norm with q>1 is attractive in many applications of regression and classification in that it facilitates group sparsity in the model. Existing work deals with special cases with q=1, 2, infinity, and they cannot be easily extended to the general case. To further improve the efficiency of solving large dimensional mixed-norm regularized problems, we propose a screening method which is able to quickly identify the inactive groups, i.e., groups that have 0 components in the solution

The Complexity of Counting Homomorphisms to Cactus Graphs Modulo 2 (Andreas GÃ¶bel - 25 April, 2014)
Many combinatorial structures that arise in mathematics and computer science can be represented naturally as graph homomorphisms and as weighted sums of graph homomorphisms. In this paper, we study the complexity of counting homomorphisms modulo 2. The complexity of modular counting was introduced by Papadimitriou and Zachos and it has been pioneered by Valiant who famously introduced a problem for which counting modulo 7 is easy but counting modulo 2 is intractable. We show that, for some cactus graphs H, counting homomorphisms to H modulo 2 can be done in polynomial time

Branching Processes for QuickCheck Generators (AgustÃ­n Mista - 7 August, 2018)
In this paper, we adapt results from an area of mathematics known as branching processes, and show how they help to analytically predict (at compile-time) the expected number of generated constructors, even in the presence of mutually recursive or composite ADTs. When generating random values, our synthesized QuickCheck generators show improvements in code coverage when compared with those automatically derived by state-of-the-art tools.

Many of these problems arise because mathematics, particularly the mathematics of the complex numbers, is more difficult than expected: for example the complex function log is not continuous, writing down a program to compute an inverse function is more complicated than just solving an equation, and many algebraic simplification rules are not universally valid.

The Sources of Certainty in Computation and Formal Systems (Michael J. O&#39;Donnell - 17 November, 1999)
In his Discourse on the Method of Rightly Conducting the Reason, and Seeking Truth in the Sciences, Rene Descartes sought ``clear and certain knowledge of all that is useful in life.'' Almost three centuries later, in ``The foundations of mathematics,'' David Hilbert tried to ``recast mathematical definitions and inferences in such a way that they are unshakable.'' Hilbert's program relied explicitly on formal systems (equivalently, computational systems) to provide certainty in mathematics
