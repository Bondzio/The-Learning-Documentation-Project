Quantitative Perspectives on Fifty Years of the Journal of the History of Biology (B. R. Erick Peirson - 5 October, 2017)
Journal of the History of Biology provides a fifty-year long record for examining the evolution of the history of biology as a scholarly discipline. The geographic diversity of authors whose work appears in JHB has increased steadily since 1968, but the geographic coverage of the content of JHB articles remains strongly lopsided toward the United States, United Kingdom, and western Europe and has diversified much less dramatically over time. The taxonomic diversity of organisms discussed in JHB increased steadily between 1968 and the late 1990s but declined in later years, mirroring broader patterns of diversification previously reported in the biomedical research literature

Automatically identifying, counting, and describing wild animals in camera-trap images with deep learning (Mohammed Sadegh Norouzzadeh - 15 November, 2017)

Complexity Dichotomies for the Minimum F-Overlay Problem (Nathann Cohen - 15 March, 2017)
For instance, if the family F contains all connected graphs, then Minimum F-Overlay corresponds to the Minimum Connectivity Inference problem (also known as Subset Interconnection Design problem) introduced for the low-resolution reconstruction of macro-molecular assembly in structural biology, or for the design of networks.Our main contribution is a strong dichotomy result regarding the polynomial vs. when edgeless graphs of the right sizes are in F, or if F contains only cliques) are the only families giving rise to a polynomial problem: all others are NP-complete.We then investigate the parameterized complexity of the problem and give similar sufficient conditions on F that give rise to W[1]-hard, W[2]-hard or FPT problems when the parameter is the size of the solution.This yields an FPT/W[1]-hard dichotomy for a relaxed problem, where every hyperedge of H must contain some member of F as a (non necessarily spanning) subgraph.

An exact method for computing the frustration index in signed networks using binary programming (Samin Aref - 3 May, 2018)
Computing the frustration index of a signed graph is a key step toward solving problems in many fields including social networks, physics, material science, and biology. Although the definition of the frustration index goes back to 1960, its exact algorithmic computation, which is closely related to classic NP-hard graph problems, has only become a focus in recent years. Solving the models with prioritised branching and valid inequalities in Gurobi, we can compute the frustration index of real signed networks with over 15000 edges in less than a minute on inexpensive hardware

A Parameterized Algorithm for Bounded-Degree Vertex Deletion (Mingyu Xiao - 20 August, 2016)
The $d$-bounded-degree vertex deletion problem, to delete at most $k$ vertices in a given graph to make the maximum degree of the remaining graph at most $d$, finds applications in computational biology, social network analysis and some others. The $d$-bounded-degree vertex deletion problem is NP-hard for each fixed $d\geq 0$. In terms of parameterized complexity, the problem parameterized by $k$ is W[2]-hard for unbounded $d$ and fixed-parameter tractable for each fixed $d\geq 0$. In this paper, we give a uniform parameterized algorithm deterministically solving this problem in $O^*((d+1)^k)$ time for each $d\geq 3$. Note that it is an open problem whether the $d'$-hitting set problem can be solved in $O^*((d'-1)^k)$ time for $d'\geq 3$

On Stabbing Queries for Generalized Longest Repeat (Bojian Xu - 7 November, 2015)
A longest repeat query on a string, motivated by its applications in many subfields including computational biology, asks for the longest repetitive substring(s) covering a particular string position (point query). Our method for interval query takes a different approach using the insight from a recent work on \emph{shortest unique substrings} [1], as the prior work's approach for point query becomes infeasible in the setting of interval query. Using the critical insight from [1], we propose an indexing structure, which can be constructed in the optimal $O(n)$ time and space for a string of size $n$, such that any future interval query can be answered in $O(1)$ time

Artificial Mutation inspired Hyper-heuristic for Runtime Usage of Multi-objective Algorithms (Donia El Kateb - 18 February, 2014)
In this paper, we reconsider this founding analogy to accelerate convergence of MOEA, by looking at modern biology studies: artificial selection has been used to achieve an anticipated specific purpose instead of only relying on crossover and natural selection (i.e., Muller et al [18] research on artificial mutation of fruits with X-Ray). Putting aside the analogy with natural selection , the present paper proposes an hyper-heuristic for MOEA algorithms named Sputnik 1 that uses artificial selective mutation to improve the convergence speed of MOEA

Effect of interaction strength on the evolution of cooperation (Feng Wenfeng - 12 September, 2012)
Cooperative behaviors are ubiquitous in nature,which is a puzzle to evolutionary biology,because the defector always gains more benefit than the cooperator,thus,the cooperator should decrease and vanish over time.This typical "prisoners' dilemma" phenomenon has been widely researched in recent years.The interaction strength between cooperators and defectors is introduced in this paper(in human society,it can be understood as the tolerance of cooperators).We find that only when the maximum interaction strength is between two critical values,the cooperator and defector can coexist,otherwise, 1) if it is greater than the upper value,the cooperator will vanish, 2) if it is less than the lower value,a bistable state will appear.

Ten-Year Cross-Disciplinary Comparison of the Growth of Open Access and How it Increases Research Citation Impact (C. Hajjem - 15 August, 2006)
We tested 1,307,038 articles published across 12 years (1992-2003) in 10 disciplines (Biology, Psychology, Sociology, Health, Political Science, Economics, Education, Law, Business, Management). A robot trawls the Web for full-texts using reference metadata ISI citation data (signal detectability d'=2.45; bias = 0.52). Percentage OA (relative to total OA + NOA) articles varies from 5%-16% (depending on discipline, year and country) and is slowly climbing annually (correlation r=.76, sample size N=12, probability p < 0.005). Comparing OA and NOA articles in the same journal/year, OA articles have consistently more citations, the advantage varying from 36%-172% by discipline and year. Comparing articles within six citation ranges (0, 1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15, 16+ citations), the annual percentage of OA articles is growing significantly faster than NOA within every citation range (r > .90, N=12, p < .0005) and the effect is greater with the more highly cited articles (r = .98, N=6, p < .005). Causality cannot be determined from these data, but our prior finding of a similar pattern in physics, where percent OA is much higher (and even approaches 100% in some subfields), makes it unlikely that the OA citation advantage is merely or mostly a self-selection bias (for making only one's better articles OA)

Are academicians elsewhere agreeing on the fact that BD is a new science? Granted that big data science is a new science what are its foundations as compared to conventional topics in Physics, Chemistry or Biology? Or, is it similar to astronomy or nuclear science? What are the technological and engineering implications and how these can be advantageously used to augment business intelligence, for example? Will the industry adopt the changes due to tactical advantages? How can BD success stories be carried over elsewhere? How will BD affect the Computer Science and other curricula? How will BD benefit different segments of our society on a large scale? To answer these, an appreciation of the BD as a science and as a technology is necessary
