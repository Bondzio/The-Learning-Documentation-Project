Listening for Sirens: Locating and Classifying Acoustic Alarms in City Scenes (Letizia Marchegiani - 11 October, 2018)
Lastly, we use the denoised signals to localise the acoustic source on the horizon plane, by regressing the direction of arrival of the sound through a CNN architecture. Our experimental evaluation shows an average classification rate of 94%, and a median absolute error on the localisation of 7.5Â° when operating on audio frames of 0.5s, and of 2.5Â° when operating on frames of 2.5s

Multimodal Speech Emotion Recognition Using Audio and Text (Seunghyun Yoon - 10 October, 2018)
As emotional dialogue is composed of sound and spoken content, our model encodes the information from audio and text sequences using dual recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and then combines the information from these sources to predict the emotion class. Our proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in assigning data to one of four emotion categories (i.e., angry, happy, sad and neutral) when the model is applied to the IEMOCAP dataset, as reflected by accuracies ranging from 68.8% to 71.8%.

Self-Supervised Generation of Spatial Audio for 360 Video (Pedro Morgado - 7 September, 2018)
We introduce an approach to convert mono audio recorded by a 360 video camera into spatial audio, a representation of the distribution of sound over the full viewing sphere. Spatial audio is an important component of immersive 360 video viewing, but spatial audio microphones are still rare in current 360 video production. Our system consists of end-to-end trainable neural networks that separate individual sound sources and localize them on the viewing sphere, conditioned on multi-modal analysis of audio and 360 video frames. We introduce several datasets, including one filmed ourselves, and one collected in-the-wild from YouTube, consisting of 360 videos uploaded with spatial audio. Using our approach, we show that it is possible to infer the spatial location of sound sources based only on 360 video and a mono audio track.

Our main findings are that (i) low cognitive load-inducing (ie, more intuitive) acoustic parameters correspond to higher mapping accuracies, (ii) EEG spectral power analysis reveals higher $Î±$ band power for low cognitive load parameters, implying a congruent relationship between explicit and implicit user responses, and (iii) Cognitive load classification with EEG features achieves a peak F1-score of 0.64, confirming that reliable workload estimation is achievable with user EEG data compiled using wearable sensors.

Multichannel Sound Event Detection Using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks for Learning Inter-channel Features (Sharath Adavanne - 29 January, 2018)
In order to evaluate the proposed method, multichannel audio datasets with different number of overlapping sound sources are synthesized. A similar study is also done with the binaural and single-channel versions of the real-life recording TUT-SED 2017 development dataset. The results show that on using multichannel Ambisonic audio in place of single-channel audio we improve the overall F-score by 7.5%, overall error rate by 10% and recognize 15.6% more sound events in time frames with four overlapping sound sources.

Comparing Radio Propagation Channels Between 28 and 140 GHz Bands in a Shopping Mall (Sinh Le Hong Nguyen - 26 December, 2017)
In this paper, we compare the radio propagation channels characteristics between 28 and 140 GHz bands based on the wideband (several GHz) and directional channel sounding in a shopping mall environment. Our results reveal that there is high spatial-temporal correlation between 28 and 140 GHz channels, similar numbers of strong multipath components, and only small variations in the large-scale parameters between the two bands. Furthermore, when including the weak paths there are higher total numbers of clusters and paths in 28 GHz as compared to those in 140 GHz bands. With these similarities, it would be very interesting to investigate the potentials of using 140 GHz band in the future mobile radio communications.

Phonological information content, a measure of a word's string probability under a statistical model of a language's sound or character sequences, concisely captures distinctiveness. Examining large-scale corpora from 13 languages, we find that distinctiveness significantly outperforms word length as a predictor of frequency

Pronunciation recognition of English phonemes /\textipa{@}/, /Ã¦/, /\textipa{A}:/ and /\textipa{2}/ using Formants and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (Keith Y. Patarroyo - 22 February, 2017)
The objective of this study was to quantitatively measure the extent at which speech recognition methods can distinguish between similar sounding vowels. In particular, the phonemes /\textipa{@}/, /Ã¦/, /\textipa{A}:/ and /\textipa{2}/ were analysed. 748 sound files from the corpus were used and subjected to Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) to compute their formants, and to Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) algorithm, to compute the cepstral coefficients. A Decision Tree Classifier was used to build a predictive model that learnt the patterns of the two first formants measured in the data set, as well as the patterns of the 13 cepstral coefficients. An accuracy of 70\% was achieved using formants for the mentioned phonemes. For the MFCC analysis an accuracy of 52 \% was achieved and an accuracy of 71\% when /\textipa{@}/ was ignored

The Influence of Teamwork Quality on Software Team Performance (Emily Weimar - 22 January, 2017)
Traditionally, software quality is thought to depend on sound software engineering and development methodologies such as structured programming and agile development. Since the success rate of software development projects is low (Wateridge, 1995; The Standish Group, 2009), it is important to understand which characteristics of interactions within software development teams significantly influence performance. The relationship between TWQ and team performance and the improvement of the model are tested using data from 252 team members and stakeholders. Results show that teamwork quality is significantly related to team performance, as rated by both team members and stakeholders: TWQ explains 81% of the variance of team performance as rated by team members and 61% as rated by stakeholders

Integrating High Level and Low Level Planning (Pete Trautman - 26 November, 2016)
We explore this \emph{integrated planning} formulation in three case studies, and in the process find that this formulation 1) generalizes the ROS navigation stack in a practically useful way 2) arbitrates between high and low level decision making in a statistically sound manner when unanticipated local disturbances arise and 3) enables the integration of an onboard operator providing real time input at either the global (e.g., waypoint designation) or local (e.g., joystick) level. Importantly, the integrated planning formulation $p(\boldsymbolÎ·_0,\mathbf{f}^{(R)},\mathbf{f}\mid\mathbf{z}_{1:t})$ highlights failure modes of the ROS navigation stack (and thus for standard hierarchical planning architectures); these failure modes are resolved by using $p(\boldsymbolÎ·_0,\mathbf{f}^{(R)},\mathbf{f}\mid\mathbf{z}_{1:t})$. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of how results from formal methods can guide our factorization of $p(\boldsymbolÎ·_0,\mathbf{f}^{(R)},\mathbf{f}\mid\mathbf{z}_{1:t})$.

Tests show that the respective ANNs can correctly identify 71.43\% of the birds, 94.44\% of the dogs, and 90.91\% of the frogs

SALSA: A Novel Dataset for Multimodal Group Behavior Analysis (Xavier Alameda-Pineda - 23 June, 2015)
To this end, we propose SALSA, a novel dataset facilitating multimodal and Synergetic sociAL Scene Analysis, and make two main contributions to research on automated social interaction analysis: (1) SALSA records social interactions among 18 participants in a natural, indoor environment for over 60 minutes, under the poster presentation and cocktail party contexts presenting difficulties in the form of low-resolution images, lighting variations, numerous occlusions, reverberations and interfering sound sources; (2) To alleviate these problems we facilitate multimodal analysis by recording the social interplay using four static surveillance cameras and sociometric badges worn by each participant, comprising the microphone, accelerometer, bluetooth and infrared sensors

Second, we exploit the generative capability of DCRBMs to activate the trained model so as to generate the lower-level data corresponding to the specific ESIP that closely matches the actual training data (with mean square error 0.01-0.1 for generating 100 frames)

Unsupervised Incremental Learning and Prediction of Music Signals (Ricard Marxer - 23 October, 2015)
The flow of the system is as follows: 1) segmentation by onset detection, 2) timbre representation of each segment by Mel frequency cepstrum coefficients, 3) discretization by incremental clustering, yielding a tree of different sound classes (e.g. instruments) that can grow or shrink on the fly driven by the instantaneous sound events, resulting in a discrete symbol sequence, 4) extraction of statistical regularities of the symbol sequence, using hierarchical N-grams and the newly introduced conceptual Boltzmann machine, and 5) prediction of the next sound event in the sequence. Clustering in isolation yields an adjusted Rand index (ARI) of 82.7% / 85.7% for data sets of singing voice and drums. Onset detection jointly with clustering achieve an ARI of 81.3% / 76.3% and the prediction of the entire system yields an ARI of 27.2% / 39.2%.

We present examples where the use of belief functions provided sound and elegant solutions to real life problems. The examples deal with 1) discriminant analysis using a learning set where classes are only partially known; 2) an information retrieval systems handling inter-documents relationships; 3) the combination of data from sensors competent on partially overlapping frames; 4) the determination of the number of sources in a multi-sensor environment by studying the inter-sensors contradiction

Science 3.0: Corrections to the Science 2.0 paradigm (Vladimir B. Teif - 19 January, 2013)
Although technically sound, the concept still does not work as expected. Here we provide a systematic line of arguments to modify the concept of Science 2.0, making it more consistent with the spirit and traditions of science and Internet. Our first correction to the Science 2.0 paradigm concerns the open-access publication models charging fees to the authors. Our second correction concerns post-publication comments online, which are all essentially non-anonymous in the current Science 2.0 paradigm. We further analyze the reasons of the failure of the current post-publication peer-review models and suggest what needs to be changed in Science 3.0 to convert Internet into a large journal club.

Parameters of Two-Prover-One-Round Game and The Hardness of Connectivity Problems (Bundit Laekhanukit - 11 December, 2012)
Optimizing parameters of Two-Prover-One-Round Game (2P1R) is an important task in PCPs literature as it would imply a smaller PCP with the same or stronger soundness. Based on recent development on 2P1R by Chan (ECCC 2011) and several techniques in PCPs literature, we improve hardness results of some connectivity problems that are in the form $k^Ï$, for some (very) small constant $Ï>0$, to hardness results of the form $k^c$ for some explicit constant $c$, where $k$ is a connectivity parameter

Overall our new scheme has the good features of having a zero-knowledge security proof based on well known hard problem of coding theory, a small size of secret and public key (a few hundred bits), a small calculation complexity, for an overall communication cost of 19kb for authentication (for a $2^{16}$ security) and a signature of size of 93kb (11.5kB) (for security $2^{80}$), an improvement of 40% compared to previous schemes based on coding theory.

Sonification of Network Traffic Flow for Monitoring and Situational Awareness (Mohamed Debashi - 19 December, 2017)
SoNSTAR identifies the features of network traffic flows by inspecting the status flags of TCP/IP packet headers and mapping traffic events to recorded sounds to generate a soundscape representing the real-time status of the network traffic environment. Listening to the soundscape allows the administrator to recognise anomalous behaviour quickly and without having to continuously watch a computer screen.

Uplink Sounding Reference Signal Coordination to Combat Pilot Contamination in 5G Massive MIMO (Lorenzo Galati Giordano - 19 December, 2017)
Ongoing fifth-generation (5G) standardisation activities are debating the amount of resources to be dedicated to the transmission of pilot sequences, focussing on uplink sounding reference signals (UL SRSs) design. Said features result in a cell throughput improvement over both fixed reuse and state-of-the-art FR based on a cell-centric perspective.

Deep Neural Networks for Multiple Speaker Detection and Localization (Weipeng He - 26 February, 2018)
Previous neural network-based methods have been focusing on localizing a single sound source, which do not extend to multiple sources in terms of detection and localization.
