Kannada Spell Checker with Sandhi Splitter (A N Akshatha - 25 November, 2016)
The sandhi splitter can split about 7000 most common sandhi words in Kannada language used as test samples. It is twice as fast, 200 times more space efficient, and it is 90% accurate in case of complex nouns and 50% accurate for complex verbs

Significance of the levels of spectral valleys with application to front/back distinction of vowel sounds (T. V. Ananthapadmanabha - 5 October, 2015)
Classification of vowels into front/back distinction with the difference (VI-VII) as an acoustic feature, tested using TIMIT, NTIMIT, Tamil and Kannada language databases gives, on the average, an accuracy of about 95%, which is comparable to the accuracy (90.6%) obtained using a neural network classifier trained and tested using MFCC as the feature vector for TIMIT database. The acoustic feature (VI-VII) has also been tested for its robustness on the TIMIT database for additive white and babble noise and an accuracy of about 95% has been obtained for SNRs down to 25 dB for both types of noise.

Implicit segmentation of Kannada characters in offline handwriting recognition using hidden Markov models (Manasij Venkatesh - 16 October, 2014)
We use HMMs to take advantage of the agglutinative nature of Kannada script, which allows us to perform implicit segmentation of characters along with recognition. All the experiments are performed on the Chars74k dataset that consists of 657 handwritten characters collected across multiple users. The use of implicit segmentation technique at the character level resulted in an improvement of around 10%. This system also outperformed an existing system tested on the same dataset by around 16%. Accordingly, we collected additional data and obtained an improvement of 4% with 6 additional samples.

Gaussian Mixture Model for Handwritten Script Identification (Mallikarjun Hangarge - 11 March, 2013)
This paper presents a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to identify the script of handwritten words of Roman, Devanagari, Kannada and Telugu scripts. A dataset of 400 images out of 800 (200 of each script) are used for training GMM and the remaining is for testing. An exhaustive experimentation is carried out at bi-script, tri-script and multi-script level and achieved script identification accuracies in percentage as 98.7, 98.16 and 96.91 respectively.

Discrimination of English to other Indian languages (Kannada and Hindi) for OCR system (Ankit Kumar - 10 May, 2012)
We analysed 700 different words of Kannada, English and Hindi in order to extract the discrimination features and for the development of knowledge base. The proposed system is tested on 100 different document images containing more than 1000 text words of each script and a classification rate of 98.25%, 99.25% and 98.87% is achieved for Kannada, English and Hindi respectively.

Multi-font Multi-size Kannada Numeral Recognition Based on Structural Features (B. V. Dhandra - 18 November, 2011)
A Euclidian minimum distance criterion is used to find minimum distances and K-nearest neighbor classifier is used to classify the Kannada numerals by varying the size of numeral image from 16 to 50 font sizes for the 20 different font styles from NUDI and BARAHA popular word processing Kannada software. The total 1150 numeral images are tested and the overall accuracy of classification is found to be 100%. The average time taken by this method is 0.1476 seconds.

Spatial Features for Multi-Font/Multi-Size Kannada Numerals and Vowels Recognition (B. V. Dhandra - 6 July, 2011)
Directional spatial features viz stroke density, stroke length and the number of stokes in an image are employed as potential features to characterize the printed Kannada numerals and vowels. Based on these features 1100 numerals and 1400 vowels are classified with Multi-class Support Vector Machines (SVM). The proposed system achieves the recognition accuracy as 98.45% and 90.64% for numerals and vowels respectively.
