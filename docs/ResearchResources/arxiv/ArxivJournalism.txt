A Multilingual Information Extraction Pipeline for Investigative Journalism (Gregor Wiedemann - 1 September, 2018)
We introduce an advanced information extraction pipeline to automatically process very large collections of unstructured textual data for the purpose of investigative journalism. The pipeline serves as a new input processor for the upcoming major release of our New/s/leak 2.0 software, which we develop in cooperation with a large German news organization. In contrast to comparable projects, we focus on the following three major requirements particularly serving the use case of investigative journalism in cross-border collaborations: 1) composition of multiple state-of-the-art NLP tools for entity extraction, 2) support of multi-lingual document sets up to 40 languages, 3) fast and easy-to-use extraction of full-text, metadata and entities from various file formats.

New/s/leak 2.0 - Multilingual Information Extraction and Visualization for Investigative Journalism (Gregor Wiedemann - 13 July, 2018)
Investigative journalism in recent years is confronted with two major challenges: 1) vast amounts of unstructured data originating from large text collections such as leaks or answers to Freedom of Information requests, and 2) multi-lingual data due to intensified global cooperation and communication in politics, business and civil society. To support such collaborations, we present the new version of new/s/leak 2.0, our open-source software for content-based searching of leaks. It includes three novel main features: 1) automatic language detection and language-dependent information extraction for 40 languages, 2) entity and keyword visualization for efficient exploration, and 3) decentral deployment for analysis of confidential data from various formats
