Propagation Measurement System and Approach at 140 GHz-Moving to 6G and Above 100 GHz (Yunchou Xing - 22 August, 2018)

The measurements, applicable to fixed wireless access, involved a 55-deg transmit antenna placed on the exterior of a street-facing window and a 10-deg receive horn antenna spinning on top of a van mast at 3 m height, emulating a lamppost-mounted base station. Measured path gain-distance dependence is well represented by power-law models, and azimuth gains at the base are degraded through scattering by more than 4.3 dB for 10% of links. It was found that, with 51 dBm EIRP at the FWA base station and 11 dBi antenna at CPE, 1 Gbps downlink rate can be delivered to an outdoor mounted CPE for up to 100 m from a base station deployed in the same street with 90% coverage guarantee.

Using a queuing network based model for the wireless system we characterize the effect of various design choices on the maximum URLLC load it can support, including: 1) system parameters such as the bandwidth, link SINR , and QoS requirements; 2) resource allocation schemes in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) based systems; and 3) Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) schemes. Key contributions of this paper which are of practical interest are: 1) study of how the the minimum required system bandwidth to support a given URLLC load scales with associated QoS constraints; 2) characterization of optimal OFDMA resource allocation schemes which maximize the admissible URLLC load; and 3) optimization of a repetition code based HARQ scheme which approximates Chase HARQ combining.

Ubiquitous Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communications (Giovanni Interdonato - 10 April, 2018)
Since then, we have witnessed an incredible wireless revolution, where cellular connectivity has gone from being a luxury product to a commodity and where the main application has changed from voice calls to data transfer. From 1G to 4G, the massive traffic growth has been managed by a combination of wider bandwidths, refined radio interfaces, and smaller cells [1]. Due its cost-efficiency, the latter has contributed the most; cell towers used to be 10 km apart and are now only 100 m apart in urban areas. While rigid frequency planning was originally used to alleviate inter-cell interference, the interference is becoming a major bottleneck as we densify the networks [2], because each cell is then hit by non-negligible interference from many neighboring cells. One way to deal with inter-cell interference is to manage it spatially by Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) methods [3], which is a key 5G technology

Cross-Layer Designs for Body-to-Body Networks: Adaptive CSMA/CA with Distributed Routing (Samiya M. Shimly - 15 March, 2018)
In this paper, we propose a novel adaptive carrier sense multiple access scheme with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) to perform efficient and reliable data transfer with increased throughput across multiple coexisting wireless body area networks (BANs) in a tiered architecture. Our proposed optimization using adaptive carrier sensing performs better than static carrier sensing with CSMA/CA as it reduces the continuous back-off duration and latency as well as significantly increases the throughput (in successful packets/s) by more than 50%. Adaptive CSMA/CA also shows 20% and 6% improvement over a coordinated TDMA approach with higher duty cycle for throughput and spectral efficiency, respectively, and provides acceptable packet delivery ratio and outage probability with respect to SINR.

A Multi-Kernel Multi-Code Polar Decoder Architecture (Gabriele Coppolino - 2 February, 2018)
Polar codes have received increasing attention in the past decade, and have been selected for the next generation of wireless communication standard. Most research on polar codes has focused on codes constructed from a $2\times2$ polarization matrix, called binary kernel: codes constructed from binary kernels have code lengths that are bound to powers of $2$. A few recent works have proposed construction methods based on multiple kernels of different dimensions, not only binary ones, allowing code lengths different from powers of $2$. The decoder can achieve frequency of more than $1$ GHz in $65$ nm CMOS technology, and a throughput of $615$ Mb/s. The area occupation ranges between $0.11$ mm$^2$ for $N_{max}=256$ and $2.01$ mm$^2$ for $N_{max}=4096$. Implementation results show an unprecedented degree of flexibility: with $N_{max}=4096$, up to $55$ code lengths can be decoded with the same hardware, along with any kernel sequence and code rate.

Secure Transmission and Self-Energy Recycling for Wireless-Powered Relay Systems with Partial Eavesdropper Channel State Information (Jingping Qiao - 29 December, 2017)
For efficient energy transfer and information relaying, a novel two-phase protocol is proposed, in which the relay operates in full-duplex (FD) mode to achieve simultaneous wireless power and information transmission. Compared with those existing protocols, the proposed design possesses two main advantages: 1) it fully exploits the available hardware resource (antenna element) of relay and can offer higher secrecy rate; 2) it enables self-energy recycling (S-ER) at relay, in which the loopback interference (LI) generated by FD operation is harvested and reused for information relaying. Simulations are done and results reveal that the proposed S-ER based secure transmission scheme outperforms the traditional time-switching based relaying (TSR) scheme at a maximum WCSR gain of 80%.Results also demonstrate that the WCSR performance of the scheme reusing idle antennas for information reception is much better than that of schemes exploiting only one receive antenna.

In this paper, the resulting problem is studied from an information-theoretic viewpoint by making the following practically relevant assumptions: 1) the ENs have multiple antennas; 2) only uncoded fractional caching is allowed; 3) the fronthaul links are used to send fractions of contents; and 4) the ENs are constrained to use one-shot linear precoding on the wireless channel. The characterization is exact for a subset of system parameters, and is generally optimal within a multiplicative factor of 3/2 for the serial case and of 2 for the pipelined case

Wireless sensor networks usually comprise a large number of sensors monitoring changes in variables. This work seeks to identify them based on an approach presented in [1]. A critical review of most previous works in this area has been presented in [2], and few more are considered here just to set the stage. The main work can be described as this; given a set of measurements from sensors that represent a normal situation, [1] proceeds by first estimating the probability density function (pdf) of the set using a data-split approach, then estimate the entropy of the set using the arithmetic mean as an approximation for the expectation. The results presented in [1] have been confirmed for different test signals such as the Gaussian, Beta, in one dimension and beta in two dimensions, and a beta and uniform mixture distribution in two dimensions. The major drawbacks of [1] were identified, and a method that seeks to mitigate this using the Bhattacharyya distance is presented. This method detects more subtle anomalies, especially the type that would pass as normal in [1]

The Spatial Outage Capacity of Wireless Networks (Sanket S Kalamkar - 23 January, 2018)
We address a fundamental question in wireless networks that, surprisingly, has not been studied before: what is the maximum density of concurrently active links that satisfy a certain outage constraint? We call this quantity the spatial outage capacity (SOC), give a rigorous definition, and analyze it for Poisson bipolar networks with ALOHA. In the high-reliability regime where the target outage probability is close to zero, we obtain an exact closed-form expression of the SOC, which reveals the interesting and perhaps counter-intuitive result that all transmitters need to be always active to achieve the SOC, i.e., the transmit probability needs to be set to 1 to achieve the SOC.

In this paper we investigate its enhancement based on the use of physical-layer network coding and signature coding, whose main feature is enabling simultaneous resolution of up to K users contending for access, where K >= 1. In particular, the slot access probability is chosen in line with an estimate of the number of users in the system that is obtained relying on the pseudo-Bayesian approach by Rivest, which we generalise for the case that K > 1. Under the assumption that this estimate reflects the actual number of users, we show that our approach achieves throughput 1 in the limit of large K.

We deploy our system in a 4,800 $ft^{2}$ (446 $m^{2}$) house spread across three floors, a 13,024 $ft^{2}$ (1210 $m^{2}$) office area covering 41 rooms, as well as a one-acre (4046 $m^{2}$) vegetable farm and show that we can achieve reliable coverage, using only a single RF source and receiver. We show that these devices can reliably backscatter data across a 3,328 $ft^{2}$ (309 $m^{2}$) room. Finally, we present a design sketch of a LoRa backscatter IC that shows that it costs less than a dime at scale and consumes only 9.25 $Î¼$W of power, which is more than 1000x lower power than LoRa radio chipsets.

Coverage and Rate Analysis of Super Wi-Fi Networks Using Stochastic Geometry (Neelakantan Nurani Krishnan - 26 April, 2017)
Recent regulatory changes proposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permitting unlicensed use of television white space (TVWS) channels present new opportunities for designing wireless networks that make efficient use of this spectrum. Since regulations governing unlicensed use of these channels allow (a) mounting fixed devices up to a height of 30 m and operation at transmit powers of up to 4 W EIRP, and (b) operation at transmit powers of up to 100 mW EIRP for portable devices, such networks can provide extended coverage and higher rates than traditional Wi-Fi networks. Such an analysis reveals that (a) maximum coverage of no more than 700 m is obtained even when APs are deployed at 30 m height, and (b) operating APs at transmit power of more than 1 W is beneficial only at sparse deployment densities when rate is prioritized over coverage.

How Much Spectrum is Too Much in Millimeter Wave Wireless Access (Jinfeng Du - 13 April, 2017)
A great increase in wireless access rates might be attainable by using the large amount of spectrum available in the millimeter wave (mmWave, 30 - 300 GHz) band. However, due to higher propagation losses inherent in these frequencies, to use wider bandwidth for transmission at ranges beyond 100 meters or in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) settings may be ineffective or even counterproductive when the penalty for estimating the channel is taken into account. Under some typical deployment scenarios with both transmit and receive side beamforming, 1 GHz bandwidth can be too much.

Energy Efficient Resource Allocation in EH-enabled CR Networks for IoT (Ali Shahini - 6 July, 2018)
In parallel with the development of CR techniques, Wireless Energy Harvesting (WEH) is considered as one of the emerging technologies to eliminate the need of recharging or replacing the batteries for IoT and CR networks. To this end, we propose to utilize WEH for CR networks in which the CR devices are not only capable of sensing the available radio frequencies in a collaborative manner but also harvesting the wireless energy transferred by an Access Point (AP)
