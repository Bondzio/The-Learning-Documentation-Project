G7.7-3.7: a young supernova remnant probably associated with the guest star in 386 CE (SN 386) (Ping Zhou - 10 September, 2018)
There are a few ancient Chinese records of "guest stars" that are probably sightings of supernovae for which the associated supernova remnant is not established. Here we present an X-ray study of the supernova remnant G7.7-3.7, as observed by XMM-Newton, and discuss its probable association with the guest star of 386 CE. The X-ray morphology of G7.7-3.7 shows an arc-like feature in the SNR south, which is characterized by an under-ionized plasma with sub-solar abundances, a temperature of 0.4--0.8 keV, and a density of $\sim 0.5(d/4 kpc)^{-0.5}$ cm$^{-3}$. A small shock age of $1.2\pm 0.6 (d/4 kpc)^{0.5}$ kyr is inferred from the low ionization timescale of $2.4^{+1.1}_{-1.3}\times 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$ s of the X-ray arc. The low foreground absorption ($N_H=3.5\pm0.5\times 10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$) of G7.7-3.7 made the supernova explosion visible to the naked eyes on the Earth. The position of G7.7-3.7 is consistent with the event of 386 CE, and the X-ray properties suggest that also its age is consistent. Interestingly, the association between G7.7-3.7 and guest star 386 would suggest the supernova to be a low-luminosity supernova, in order to explain the not very long visibility (2--4 months) of the guest star.

Exoplanets in the Antarctic sky. II. 116 Transiting Exoplanet Candidates found by AST3-II (CHESPA) within the Southern CVZ of TESS (Hui Zhang - 5 September, 2018)
We report first results from the CHinese Exoplanet Searching Program from Antarctica (CHESPA)---a wide-field high-resolution photometric survey for transiting exoplanets carried out using telescopes of the AST3 (Antarctic Survey Telescopes times 3) project. During the Austral winters of 2016 and 2017 we used the AST3-II telescope to survey a set of target fields near the southern ecliptic pole, falling within the continuous viewing zone of the TESS mission \citep{Ricker10}. The first data release of the 2016 data, including images, catalogs and lightcurves of 26578 bright stars ($7.5\le i \le15$) was presented in \citet{Zhang18}. We detect 222 objects with plausible transit signals from these data, 116 of which are plausible transiting exoplanet candidates according to their stellar properties as given by the TESS Input Catalog \citep{Stassun17}, Gaia DR2 \citep{Gaia18} and TESS-HERMES spectroscopy \citep{Sharma18}. With the first data release from TESS expected in late 2018, this candidate list will be a timely for improving the rejection of potential false positives.

Semantic Role Labeling for Learner Chinese: the Importance of Syntactic Parsing and L2-L1 Parallel Data (Zi Lin - 29 August, 2018)
Based on the new data, we then evaluate three off-the-shelf SRL systems, i.e., the PCFGLA-parser-based, neural-parser-based and neural-syntax-agnostic systems, to gauge how successful SRL for learner Chinese can be. We find two non-obvious facts: 1) the L1-sentence-trained systems performs rather badly on the L2 data; 2) the performance drop from the L1 data to the L2 data of the two parser-based systems is much smaller, indicating the importance of syntactic parsing in SRL for interlanguages. Our model achieves an F-score of 72.06, which is a 2.02 point improvement over the best baseline.

Empirical observations of ultraslow diffusion driven by the fractional dynamics in languages: Dynamical statistical properties of word counts of already popular words (Hayafumi Watanabe - 29 June, 2018)

Secondly, we use theoretical analysis to show that this diffusion is basically explained by the random walk model with the power-law forgetting with the exponent $Î²\approx 0.5$, which is related to the fractional Langevin equation. The exponent $Î²$ characterises the speed of forgetting and $Î²\approx 0.5$ corresponds to (i) the border (or thresholds) between the stationary and the nonstationary and (ii) the right-in-the-middle dynamics between the IID noise for $Î²=1$ and the normal random walk for $Î²=0$

Cosmic ray $e^{+} e^{-}$ spectrum excess and peak feature observed by the DAMPE experiment from dark matter (Hong-Bo Jin - 11 January, 2018)
The Chinese satellite Wukong, also known as the DArk Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) experiment, has released its observation data of the cosmic ray (CR) electrons and positrons, which shows an excess in the energy spectrum up to TeV energy, and possibly a peak-like structure at 1.4 TeV. However, the annihilation cross section is of the order of $10^{-23} \cm^3 s^{-1}$, larger than required for obtaining the correct relic abundance. We then study whether the narrow peak at 1.4 TeV could be explained by a nearby subhalo, which thanks to the smaller distance, could supply $e^+e^-$ within a narrow energy range. We find that in order to produce a peak width less than the DAMPE energy bin width (0.2 TeV), the source must be located within $r< 0.6 \kpc$. Our global fit models do not produce the peak-like feature, instead at 1.4 TeV the spectrum show either a slope or a cliff-like feature. If the dark matter decay and annihilation rates are determined using the broad excess, the required subhalo mass could be $\sim10^{5} \Msun$ for decay model with lifetime $7.3\times 10^{25}$ s, or $\sim10^{4.5} \Msun$ for annihilation model with cross-section $10^{-23} \cm^3 \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and a shallower density profile slope $Î±=1.2$, or $\sim10^{2.5} \Msun $ for a steep profile with $Î±=1.7$.

New sunspots and aurorae in the historical Chinese text corpus? Comments on uncritical digital search applications (D. L. Neuhaeuser - 24 November, 2017)
We review some applications of the method of electronic searching for historical observations of sunspots and aurorae in the Chinese text corpus by Hayakawa et al. 2000), which is not mentioned in those papers; the remaining records are dubious and often refer to other phenomena, neither spots nor aurorae (this also applies to Hayakawa et al. We present Chinese texts and translations for some of their presumable new aurorae: only one can be considered a likely true aurora (AD 604 Jan); some others were selected on the sole basis of the use of the word "light" or "rainbow".

Structure Regularized Bidirectional Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network for Relation Classification (Ji Wen - 6 November, 2017)
In this paper, we present a novel model, Structure Regularized Bidirectional Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network(SR-BRCNN), to classify the relation of two entities in a sentence, and the new dataset of Chinese Sanwen for named entity recognition and relation classification. We propose a structure regularized model to learn relation representations along the SDP extracted from the forest formed by the structure regularized dependency tree, which benefits reducing the complexity of the whole model and helps improve the $F_{1}$ score by 10.3. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on the Chinese Sanwen task and performs as well on the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset\footnote{The Chinese Sanwen corpus this paper developed and used will be released in the further.

Deep Imaging of the HCG 95 Field.I.Ultra-diffuse Galaxies (Dongdong Shi - 30 August, 2017)
We present a detection of 89 candidates of ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) in a 4.9 degree$^2$ field centered on the Hickson Compact Group 95 (HCG 95) using deep $g$- and $r$-band images taken with the Chinese Near Object Survey Telescope. This field contains one rich galaxy cluster (Abell 2588 at $z$=0.199) and two poor clusters (Pegasus I at $z$=0.013 and Pegasus II at $z$=0.040). The 89 candidates are likely associated with the two poor clusters, giving about 50 $-$ 60 true UDGs with a half-light radius $r_{\rm e} > 1.5$ kpc and a central surface brightness $Î¼(g,0) > 24.0$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$. Deep $z$'-band images are available for 84 of the 89 galaxies from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), confirming that these galaxies have an extremely low central surface brightness. Moreover, our UDG candidates are spread over a wide range in $g-r$ color, and $\sim$26% are as blue as normal star-forming galaxies, which is suggestive of young UDGs that are still in formation. Interestingly, we find that one UDG linked with HCG 95 is a gas-rich galaxy with H I mass $1.1 \times 10^{9} M_{\odot}$ detected by the Very Large Array, and has a stellar mass of $M_\star \sim 1.8 \times 10^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$. Our results show that the high abundance of blue UDGs in the HCG 95 field is favored by the environment of poor galaxy clusters residing in H I-rich large-scale structures.

Repeat-pass SAR Interferometry Experiments with Gaofen-3: A Case Study of Ningbo Area (Tao Zhang - 31 March, 2017)
This paper reports the repeat-pass interferometric SAR results of Gaofen-3, a Chinese civil SAR satellite, acquired in November 2016 and March 2017 from Ningbo area. With the spatial baseline about 600 m and time baseline 116 days, the coherence of the two images still achieve good enough to generate the digital elevation model (DEM). By using the latest SAR interferogram filter and phase unwrapping method we proposed, we improved the coherence up to 0.88 in urban area and obtained a high quality DEM in Ningbo area. And the result shows that accuracy of the elevation map is about 5 m (RMS) in plane area and 22m (RMS) in mountainous region, which demonstrated that Gaofen-3 has the powerful ability of repeat-pass SAR Interferometry.

Building Fast and Compact Convolutional Neural Networks for Offline Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition (Xuefeng Xiao - 25 February, 2017)
Like other problems in computer vision, offline handwritten Chinese character recognition (HCCR) has achieved impressive results using convolutional neural network (CNN)-based methods. We design a nine-layer CNN for HCCR consisting of 3,755 classes, and devise an algorithm that can reduce the networks computational cost by nine times and compress the network to 1/18 of the original size of the baseline model, with only a 0.21% drop in accuracy. In tests, the proposed algorithm surpassed the best single-network performance reported thus far in the literature while requiring only 2.3 MB for storage. Furthermore, when integrated with our effective forward implementation, the recognition of an offline character image took only 9.7 ms on a CPU. Compared with the state-of-the-art CNN model for HCCR, our approach is approximately 30 times faster, yet 10 times more cost efficient.

Comparing Speech and Keyboard Text Entry for Short Messages in Two Languages on Touchscreen Phones (Sherry Ruan - 16 January, 2018)
To discover both methods' "upper-bound performance," we evaluated them in English and Mandarin Chinese on an Apple iPhone 6 Plus in a laboratory setting. Our experiment was carried out using Baidu's Deep Speech 2, a deep learning-based speech recognition system, and the built-in Qwerty (English) or Pinyin (Mandarin) Apple iOS keyboards. We found that with speech recognition, the English input rate was 2.93 times faster (153 vs. 52 WPM), and the Mandarin Chinese input rate was 2.87 times faster (123 vs. 43 WPM) than the keyboard for short message transcription under laboratory conditions for both methods. Furthermore, although speech made fewer errors during entry (5.30% vs. 11.22% corrected error rate), it left slightly more errors in the final transcribed text (1.30% vs. 0.79% uncorrected error rate)

In Theorem $1.7$ we prove the surjectivity of the reduction map of the strong approximation type for a ring quotiented by an ideal which satisfies unital set condition. In Theorem $1.8$ we prove for Dedekind type domains which include Dedekind domains, for $k\geq 2$, the map from $k$-dimensional special linear group to the product of projective spaces of $k$ mutually co-maximal ideals associating the $k$-rows or $k$-columns is surjective.

The statistical trade-off between word order and word structure - large-scale evidence for the principle of least effort (Alexander Koplenig - 25 August, 2016)
While, for example, grammatical dependency relationships in sentences are mainly conveyed by the ordering of the words for languages like Mandarin Chinese, or Vietnamese, the word ordering is much less restricted for languages such as Inupiatun or Quechua, as those languages (also) use the internal structure of words (e.g. Based on a quantitative analysis of more than 1,500 unique translations of different books of the Bible in more than 1,100 different languages that are spoken as a native language by approximately 6 billion people (more than 80% of the world population), we present large-scale evidence for a statistical trade-off between the amount of information conveyed by the ordering of words and the amount of information conveyed by internal word structure: languages that rely more strongly on word order information tend to rely less on word structure information and vice versa

Stellar Variability and Flare Rates from Dome A, Antarctica using 2009 and 2010 CSTAR Observations (Ryan J. Oelkers - 31 March, 2016)
The Chinese Small Telescope ARray (CSTAR) carried out high-cadence time-series observations of 20.1 square degrees centered on the South Celestial Pole during the 2008, 2009 & 2010 winter seasons from Dome A in Antarctica. The nearly-continuous 6 months of dark conditions during each observing season allowed for >10^6 images to be collected through gri and clear filters, resulting in the detection of >10^4 sources over the course of 3 years of operation. The nearly space-like conditions in the Antarctic plateau are an ideal testbed for the suitability of very small-aperture (<20 cm) telescopes to detect transient events, variable stars and stellar flares. We present the results of a robust search for such objects using difference image analysis of the data obtained during the 2009 & 2010 winter seasons. While no transients were found, we detected 29 flaring events and find a normalized flaring rate of 5+\-4x10^-7 flare/hour for late-K dwarfs, 1+\-1x10^-6 flare/hour for M dwarfs and 7+\-1x10^-7 flare/hour for all other stars in our sample

The statistical precision of $Ï_{ZH}$ ($m_{H}$) measurement could reach 0.97\% (6.9 MeV) in the model-independent analysis which uses only the information of Z boson decay. For the standard model Higgs boson, the $m_{H}$ precision could be improved to 5.4 MeV by including the information of Higgs decays. With the standard model $ZH$ production rate, the upper limit of ${\cal B}(H\rightarrow \rm{inv.})$ could reach 1.2\% at 95\% confidence level.

Dose conversion coefficients for Chinese reference adult male and female voxel phantoms from idealized neutron exposures (Huan Liu - 1 December, 2015)
A new set of fluence-to-dose conversion coefficients based on the Chinese reference adult voxel phantoms CRAM and CRAF are presented for six idealized external neutron exposures from 10-8 MeV to 20 MeV. The resulting dose conversion coefficients were compared with those published in ICRP Publication 116, which represents the reference Caucasian. The organ-absorbed dose conversion coefficients of most organs are in good agreement with the results in ICRP Publication 116, however, obvious discrepancies are observed for some organs and certain geometries. For neutrons with energies above 2 MeV, the effective dose conversion coefficients of Chinese reference adult are almost identical to those of ICRP Publication 116 in AP, PA, ROT and ISO geometries. When energies range from 10-8 MeV to 1 MeV, differences are within 10% in AP (5%), PA (8%) and ROT (-4%) geometries. However, relatively large discrepancies are shown in lateral and ISO geometries when energies are below 1 MeV, with differences of -15% for LLAT, -20% for RLAT and -12% for ISO, respectively.

Single Event Effect Hardness for the Front-end ASICs Applied in BGO Calorimeter of DAMPE Satellite (Shan-Shan Gao - 22 June, 2015)
Dark Matter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) is a Chinese scientific satellite designed for cosmic ray study with a primary scientific goal of indirect search of dark matter particles. As a crucial sub-detector, BGO calorimeter measures the energy spectrum of cosmic rays in the energy range from 5 GeV to 10 TeV. In order to implement high-density front-end electronics (FEE) with the ability to measure 1848 signals from 616 photomultiplier tubes on the strictly constrained satellite platform, two kinds of 32-channel front-end ASICs, VA160 and VATA160, are customized. However, a space mission period of more than 3 years makes single event effect (SEE) a probable threat to reliability. Benefiting from the single event latch-up (SEL) protection circuit for power supply, the triple module redundancy (TMR) technology for the configuration registers and optimized sequential design for data acquisition process, VA160 and VATA160 with the quantity of 54 and 32 respectively have been applied in the flight model of BGO calorimeter with radiation hardness assurance.

Electromagnetic and weak form factors of nucleon and charged quasielastic scatterings of neutrino (antineutrino) and nucleon (Bing An Li - 21 November, 2014)
The study of electromagnetic and weak form factors of nucleon (charged quasielastic scatterings of neutrino (antineutrino) and nucleon) done in $70^\prime s$ and published in Chinese journals is reviewed. The SU(6) symmetric wave functions of baryons in the rest frame ( s-wave in the rest frame) have been constructed. The axial-vector form factors of nucleon is predicted to be $G_A(q^2)/G_A(0) = F^p_1(q^2)$, where the $F^p_1$ is the first Dirac form factor of proton.

Measurement of Leakage Neutron Spectra for Tungsten with D-T Neutrons and Validation of Evaluated Nuclear Data (S. Zhanga - 19 November, 2014)
Integral neutronics experiments have been investigated at Institute of Modern Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IMP, CAS) in order to validate evaluated nuclear data related to the design of Chinese Initiative Accelerator Driven Systems (CIADS). Leakage neutron spectra from the irradiation of D-T neutrons on Tungsten slab sample were experimentally measured at 60$^{\circ}$ and 120$^{\circ}$ by using a time-of-flight method. From the comparisons, it is found that the calculations with ADS-2.0 and ENDF/B-VII.1 give good agreements with the experiments in the whole energy regions at 60$^{\circ}$, while a large discrepancy is observed at 120$^{\circ}$ in the elastic scattering peak, caused by a slight difference in the oscillation pattern of the elastic angular distribution at angles larger than 20$^{\circ}$

Structural Parameterizations of the Mixed Chinese Postman Problem (Gregory Gutin - 25 January, 2015)
In the Mixed Chinese Postman Problem (MCPP), given a weighted mixed graph $G$ ($G$ may have both edges and arcs), our aim is to find a minimum weight closed walk traversing each edge and arc at least once. The MCPP parameterized by the number of edges in $G$ or the number of arcs in $G$ is fixed-parameter tractable as proved by van Bevern {\em et al.} (in press) and Gutin, Jones and Sheng (ESA 2014), respectively. Solving an open question of van Bevern {\em et al.} (in press), we show that somewhat unexpectedly MCPP parameterized by the (undirected) treewidth of $G$ is W[1]-hard. In fact, we prove that even the MCPP parameterized by the pathwidth of $G$ is W[1]-hard. Furthermore, we believe that MCPP is the first problem known to be W[1]-hard with respect to treewidth but FPT with respect to tree-depth.

Difference Image Analysis of Defocused Observations with CSTAR (Ryan J. Oelkers - 16 October, 2014)
The Chinese Small Telescope ARray (CSTAR) carried out high-cadence time-series observations of 27 square degrees centered on the South Celestial Pole during the Antarctic winter seasons of 2008, 2009 and 2010. Aperture photometry of the 2008 and 2010 i-band images resulted in the discovery of over 200 variable stars. Yearly servicing left the array defocused for the 2009 winter season, during which the system also suffered from intermittent frosting and power failures. Using this approach, we were able to recover 68 previously-known variables and detected variability in 37 additional objects. We also have determined the observing statistics for Dome A during the 2009 winter season; we find the extinction due to clouds to be less than 0.1 and 0.4 mag for 40% and 63% of the dark time, respectively.

Profiling underprivileged residents with mid-term public transit smartcard data of Beijing (Ying Long - 19 September, 2014)
Mobility of economically underprivileged residents in China has seldom been well profiled due to privacy issue and the characteristics of Chinese over poverty. In this paper, we identify and characterize underprivileged residents in Beijing using ubiquitous public transport smartcard transactions in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Our argument is tested against (1) the household travel survey in 2010, (2) a small-scale survey in 2012, as well as (3) our interviews with local residents in Beijing. Cardholders' job and residence locations are identified using Smart Card Data (SCD) in 2008 and 2010. We then classify all identified FRs into 20 groups by residence changes (change, no change), workplace changes (change, no change, finding a job, losing a job, and all-time employed) during 2008-2010 and housing place in 2010 (within the fourth ring road or not). The underprivileged degree of each FR is then evaluated using the 2014 SCD

The Chinese comet observation in AD 773 January (Jesse Chapman - 13 August, 2014)
The authors supported their claim using a report of a historic Chinese observation of a comet ostensibly colliding with Earth's atmosphere in AD 773 January. According to the original sources, the Chinese observed a comet in mid January 773, but they report neither a collision nor a large coma, just a long tail. Ho (1962) reports sightings of this comet in China on AD 773 Jan 15 and/or 17 and in Japan on AD 773 Jan 20 (Ho 1962). Therefore, postulating a sudden increase in 14C in corals off the Chinese coast precisely in mid January 773 (Liu et al. 2014) is not justified given just the 230Th dating for AD 783 \pm 14.

The X-/Gamma-ray camera ECLAIRs for the Gammay-ray burst mission SVOM (O. Godet - 30 June, 2014)
We present ECLAIRs, the Gamma-ray burst (GRB) trigger camera to fly on-board the Chinese-French mission SVOM. ECLAIRs is a wide-field ($\sim 2$\,sr) coded mask camera with a mask transparency of 40\% and a 1024 $\mathrm{cm}^2$ detection plane coupled to a data processing unit, so-called UGTS, which is in charge of locating GRBs in near real time thanks to image and rate triggers. We present the instrument science requirements and how the design of ECLAIRs has been optimized to increase its sensitivity to high-redshift GRBs and low-luminosity GRBs in the local Universe, by having a low-energy threshold of 4 keV. The total spectral coverage ranges from 4 to 150 keV. ECLAIRs is expected to detect $\sim 200$ GRBs of all types during the nominal 3 year mission lifetime.

Dynamic evolution of cross-correlations in the Chinese stock market (Fei Ren - 17 December, 2013)
We study the dynamic evolution of cross-correlations in the Chinese stock market mainly based on the random matrix theory (RMT). The correlation matrices constructed from the return series of 367 A-share stocks traded on the Shanghai Stock Exchange from January 4, 1999 to December 30, 2011 are calculated over a moving window with a size of 400 days. We find that the stock correlations are significantly increased in the periods of two market crashes in 2001 and 2008, during which only five eigenvalues significantly deviate from the random correlation matrix, and the systemic risk is higher in these volatile periods than calm periods

Reduce Meaningless Words for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-speech Tagging (Kaixu Zhang - 25 May, 2013)
Conventional statistics-based methods for joint Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging (S&T) have generalization ability to recognize new words that do not appear in the training data. A general lexicon, Wikepedia and a large-scale raw corpus of 200 billion characters are used to generate word-based features for the wordhood. Experiments on Penn Chinese treebank 5 show that this method has a 62.9% reduction of meaningless word generation in comparison with the baseline. As a result, the F1 measure for segmentation is increased to 0.984.

One important aspect of the relationship between spoken and written Chinese is the ranked syllable-to-character mapping spectrum, which is the ranked list of syllables by the number of characters that map to the syllable. Previously, this spectrum is analyzed for more than 400 syllables without distinguishing the four intonations. In the current study, the spectrum with 1280 toned syllables is analyzed by logarithmic function, Beta rank function, and piecewise logarithmic function. By sampling from a Poisson distribution whose parameter value is chosen from the observed data, we empirically estimate the $p$-value for testing the two-piece-logarithmic-function being better than the Beta rank function hypothesis, to be 0.16

Although the connection of the Chinese "guest" star of 393 AD with the Galactic supernova remnant RX J1713.7-3946 (G347.3-0.5) made by Wang et al. in 1997 is consistent with the remnant's relatively young properties and the guest star's projected position within the `tail' of the constellation Scorpius, there are difficulties with such an association. The brief Chinese texts concerning the 393 AD guest star make no comment about its apparent brightness stating only that it disappeared after 8 months. However, at the remnant's current estimated 1 - 1.3 kpc distance and A_v ~ 3 mag, its supernova should have been a visually bright object at maximum light (-3.5 to -5.0 mag) and would have remained visible for over a year. The peak brightness ~ 0 magnitude adopted by Wang et al. We also note problems connecting SN 393 with a European record in which the Roman poet Claudian describes a visually brilliant star in the heavens around 393 AD that could be readily seen even in midday. Although several authors have suggested this account may be a reference to the Chinese supernova of 393, Scorpius would not be visible near midday in March when the Chinese first reported the 393 guest star

Microwave Zebra Pattern Structures in the X2.2 Solar Flare on Feb 15, 2011 (Baolin Tan - 26 September, 2011)
It is interesting that there are several microwave ZPs observed by the Chinese Solar Broadband Radiospectrometer (SBRS/Huairou) at frequency of 6.40 ~ 7.00 GHz (ZP1), 2.60 ~ 2.75 GHz (ZP2), and the Yunnan Solar Broadband Radio Spectrometer (SBRS/Yunnan) at frequency of 1.04 ~ 1.13 GHz (ZP3). The most important phenomena is the unusual high-frequency ZP structure (ZP1, up to 7.00 GHz) occurred in the early rising phase of the flare, and there are two ZP structure (ZP2, ZP3) with relative low frequencies occurred in the decay phase of the flare. By scrutinizing the current prevalent theoretical models of ZP structure generations, and comparing their estimated magnetic field strengths in the corresponding source regions, we suggest that the double plasma resonance model should be the most possible one for explaining the formation of microwave ZPs, which may derive the magnetic field strengths as about 230 - 345 G, 126 - 147 G, and 23 - 26 G in the source regions of ZP1, ZP2, and ZP3, respectively.

Chinese Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS), one project of the 12th five-year-plan scheme of China, is under construction in Guangdong province. Before the construction of the neutron detector, a prototype of two-dimensional 200 mmx200 mm Multi-wire Proportional Chamber (MWPC) with the flowing gas of Ar/CO2 (90/10) has been constructed and tested with the 55Fe X-Ray using part of the electronics in 2009, which showed a good performance. Following the test in 2009, the neutron detector has been constructed with the complete electronics and filled with the 6atm.3He + 2.5atm.C3H8 gas mixture in 2010

Spectroscopic Study of Globular Clusters in the Halo of M31 with Xinglong 2.16m Telescope (Zhou Fan - 10 August, 2011)
We present the spectroscopic observations for 11 confirmed globular clusters of M31 with the OMR spectrograph on 2.16m telescope at Xinglong site of National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Nine of our sample clusters are located in the halo of M31 and the most remote one is out to a projected radius of 78.75 kpc from the galactic center. The fitting results show that all our sample clusters are older than 10 Gyr, and metal-poor ($-0.91 \le $ [Fe/H] $\le -2.38$ dex). After merging the spectroscopic metallicity of our work with the previously published ones, we extended the cluster sample out to a projected radius of 117 kpc from the galaxy's center. We found the metallicity gradient for all the confirmed clusters exists with a slope of $-0.028\pm0.001$ dex kpc$^{-1}$. However, the slope turns to be $-0.018\pm0.001$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ for all the halo clusters, which is much shallower. If we only consider the outer halo clusters with $r_{\rm p}>25$ kpc, the slope becomes $-0.010\pm0.002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ and if one cluster G001 is excluded from the outer halo sample, the slope is $-0.004\pm0.002$ dex kpc$^{-1}$

Lunar Exosphere Influence on Lunar-based Near-ultraviolet Astronomical Observations (J. Wang - 2 August, 2011)
The potential effect of the lunar exosphere on the near-ultraviolet sky background emission is predicted for Lunar-based Ultraviolet Telescope (LUT: a funded Chinese scientific payload for the Chang'e-III mission). Using the upper limit on the OH concentration inferred from the recent MIP CHACE results, our calculations show that the sky brightness due to the illuminated exosphere is $<8.7\ \mathrm{photon\ s^{-1}\ cm^{-2}\ arcsec^{-2}}$ within the wavelength range 245-340 nm. An AB=13 mag point source can still be detected by the telescope at a signal-to-noise ratio more than 8 when the OH concentration is less than $2\times10^8\ \mathrm{molecules\ cm^{-3}}$

Role of Diversification Risk in Financial Bubbles (Wanfeng Yan - 5 July, 2011)
We apply this new model to two famous Chinese stock bubbles, from August 2006 to October 2007 (bubble 1) and from October 2008 to August 2009 (bubble 2). The Zipf factor is found highly significant for bubble 1, corresponding to the fact that valuation gains were more concentrated on the large firms of the Shanghai index. For bubble 2, the Zipf factor is found marginally relevant, suggesting a larger weight of market gains on small firms. We interpret this result as the consequence of the response of the Chinese economy to the very large stimulus provided by the Chinese government in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.

DÃ©composition effective de Jordan-Chevalley et ses retombÃ©es en enseignement (Danielle Couty - 15 January, 2013)
We also discuss the other classical method, based on the chinese remainder theorem, which gives the Jordan-Chevalley decomposition under the form $u=q(u) +[u-q(u)],$ with $q(u)$ absolutely semi-simple, $u-q(u)$ nilpotent, where $q$ is any solution of a system of congruence equations related to the roots of a polynomial $p\in k[x]$ such that $p(u)=0.$ It is indeed possible to compute $q$ without knowing the roots of $p$ by applying the algorithm discussed above to $Ï(x),$ where $Ï: k[x] \to k[x]/pk[x]$ is the canonical surjection. We obtain this way after 2 iterations the polynomial $q$ of degree 14 associated to the $15\times 15$ matrix mentioned above. Our arguments are based on a teaching experience of more than 10 years in an engineering school located on the Basque Coast.

We present a ?(p(|V | + |E|) log(|V |) + (dmaxp)3) time algorithm to solve the cyclic CPP on a weighted bi-directed de Bruijn graph, where p = max{|{v|din(v) - dout(v) > 0}|, |{v|din(v) - dout(v) < 0}|} and dmax = max{|din(v) - dout(v)}.

From 2015 on, SVOM will provide fast and accurate localizations of all known types of GRB, and determine the temporal and spectral properties of the GRB emission, thanks to a set of four onboard instruments. The trigger system of the coded-mask telescope ECLAIRs onboard SVOM images the sky in the 4-120 keV energy range, in order to detect and localize GRB in its 2 sr-wide field of view. The high-energy coverage is extended up to 5 MeV thanks to a non-imaging gamma-ray spectrometer

Extensive testing of Schottky CdTe detectors for the ECLAIRs X-Gamma-ray Camera on board the SVOM mission (Remoue Nadege - 1 March, 2010)
6400 of these detectors will be used to build the detection plane of the ECLAIRs camera on the Chinese-French gamma-ray burst mission SVOM. These tests are mandatory to fulfill the prime requirement of ECLAIRs to detect gamma-ray burst photons down to 4 keV. The detectors will be operated at -20C under a reverse bias of 600 V. We found that 78% of the detectors already tested could be considered for the flight model. We measured a mean energy resolution of 1.8 keV at 59.6 keV. Preliminary tests under in-flight conditions (-20C, -600 V) showed that the detectors should remain stable over a timescale larger than a day. We also measured the mean activation energy of 170 Schottky CdTe detectors. We found evidence for two distinct populations of detectors: the main one centered at 0.64 eV, interpreted as due to cadmium vacancies in the crystal, and the second population centered at 0.54 eV, correlated with a lower apparent resistivity (abridged).

Emergence of long memory in stock volatility from a modified Mike-Farmer model (Gao-Feng Gu - 12 May, 2009)
We propose a modified version of the MF model by including a new ingredient, that is, long memory in the aggressiveness (quantified by the relative prices) of incoming orders, which is an important stylized fact identified by analyzing the order flows of 23 liquid Chinese stocks. Long memory emerges in the volatility synthesized from the modified MF model with the DFA scaling exponent close to 0.76, and the cubic law of returns and the diffusive behavior of prices are also produced at the same time

Statistical properties of volatility return intervals of Chinese stocks (Fei Ren - 11 July, 2008)
The statistical properties of the return intervals $Ï_q$ between successive 1-min volatilities of 30 liquid Chinese stocks exceeding a certain threshold $q$ are carefully studied. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test shows that 12 stocks exhibit scaling behaviors in the distributions of $Ï_q$ for different thresholds $q$. Furthermore, the KS test and weighted KS test shows that the scaled return interval distributions of 6 stocks (out of the 12 stocks) can be nicely fitted by a stretched exponential function $f(Ï/\barÏ)\sim e^{- Î±(Ï/\barÏ)^Î³}$ with $Î³\approx0.31$ under the significance level of 5%, where $\barÏ$ is the mean return interval

Scaling and Memory Effect in Volatility Return Interval of the Chinese Stock Market (Tian Qiu - 14 May, 2008)
We investigate the probability distribution of the volatility return intervals $Ï$ for the Chinese stock market. To demonstrate the memory effect, we investigate the conditional probability distribution $P_{q} (Ï|Ï_{0})$, the mean conditional interval $<Ï|Ï_{0}>$ and the cumulative probability distribution of the cluster size of $Ï$. We further investigate the persistence probability distribution $P_{\pm}(t)$ and find that $P_{-}(t)$ decays by a power law with the exponent far different from the value 0.5 for the random walk, which further confirms long memory exists in $Ï$

Scaling in the distribution of intertrade durations of Chinese stocks (Zhi-Qiang Jiang - 29 April, 2008)
The distribution of intertrade durations, defined as the waiting times between two consecutive transactions, is investigated based upon the limit order book data of 23 liquid Chinese stocks listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in the whole year 2003. A scaling pattern is observed in the distributions of intertrade durations, where the empirical density functions of the normalized intertrade durations of all 23 stocks collapse onto a single curve. Maximum likelihood estimation shows that the Weibull distribution outperforms the $q$-exponential for not-too-large intertrade durations which account for more than 98.5% of the data. The distribution of intertrade durations is Weibull followed by a power-law tail with an asymptotic tail exponent close to 3.

Rank-frequency relation for Chinese characters (W. B. Deng - 26 January, 2014)
For long Chinese texts (or for mixtures of short Chinese texts), rank-frequency relations for Chinese characters display a two-layer, hierarchic structure that combines a Zipfian power-law regime for frequent characters (first layer) with an exponential-like regime for less frequent characters (second layer). The comparative analysis of rank-frequency relations for Chinese characters versus English words illustrates the extent to which the characters play for Chinese writers the same role as the words for those writing within alphabetical systems.
