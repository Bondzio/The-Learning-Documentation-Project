Beyond citations: Scholars' visibility on the social Web (Judit Bar-Ilan - 25 May, 2012)

To answer this, we sampled 57 presenters from the 2010 Leiden STI Conference, gathering publication and citations counts as well as data from the presenters' Web "footprints." We found Web presence widespread and diverse: 84% of scholars had homepages, 70% were on LinkedIn, 23% had public Google Scholar profiles, and 16% were on Twitter. For sampled scholars' publications, social reference manager bookmarks were compared to Scopus and Web of Science citations; we found that Mendeley covers more than 80% of sampled articles, and that Mendeley bookmarks are significantly correlated (r=.45) to Scopus citation counts.

When games meet reality: is Zynga overvalued? (ZalÃ¡n ForrÃ³ - 25 May, 2012)
This event followed other recent IPOs in the world of social networking companies, such as Groupon or Linkedin among others. With a valuation close to 7 billion USD at the time when it went public, Zynga became one of the biggest web IPOs since Google. Indeed, during the few months since its IPO, Zynga showed significant variability, its market capitalization going from 5.6 to 10.2 billion USD, hinting at a possible irrational behavior from the market. This allows us to bracket the valuation of Zynga using three different scenarios: 3.4, 4.0 and 4.8 billion USD in the base case, high growth and extreme growth scenario respectively. Finally, we propose an investment strategy (dated April 19th, 2012 on the arXive), which is based on our diagnostic of a bubble for Zynga and how this herding / bubbly sentiment can be expected to play together with two important coming events (the quarterly financial result announcement around April 26th, 2012 followed by the end of a first lock-up period around April 30th, 2012). The paper ends with a post-mortem analysis added on May 24th, 2012, just before going to press, showing that we have successfully predicted the downward trend of Zynga. Since April 27th, 2012, Zynga dropped 25%.

Valuation of Zynga (ZalÃ¡n ForrÃ³ - 27 December, 2011)
This event is following other recent IPOs in the world of social networking companies, such as Groupon, Linkedin or Pandora to cite a few. With a valuation close to 7 billion USD at the time when it went public, Zynga has become the biggest web IPO since Google. This leads to bracket the valuation of Zynga using three different scenarios (base one, optimistic and very optimistic): 4.17 billion USD in the base case, 5.16 billion in the high growth and 7.02 billion in the extreme growth scenario respectively. Thus, only the unlikely extreme growth scenario could potentially justify today's 6.6 billion USD valuation of Zynga

"You Know Because I Know": a Multidimensional Network Approach to Human Resources Problem (Michele Coscia - 30 May, 2013)
The social networking revolution, with online tools like Linkedin, made possible to make explicit and accessible what we perceived, but not used, for thousands of years: the exact position and ranking of a person in a network of professional and personal connections. We test our algorithm over several real world networks, extracted from DBLP and the Enron email corpus, and we show its usefulness in providing less trivial and more flexible rankings than the current state of the art algorithms.
