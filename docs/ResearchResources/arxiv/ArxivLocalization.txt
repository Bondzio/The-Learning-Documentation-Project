Deep Geodesic Learning for Segmentation and Anatomical Landmarking (Neslisah Torosdagli - 6 October, 2018)
In step 2, we formulate the landmark localization problem directly on the geodesic space for sparsely- spaced anatomical landmarks. In step 3, we propose to use a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to identify closely- spaced landmarks, which is rather difficult to obtain using other standard detection networks. We used a very challenging CBCT dataset of 50 patients with a high-degree of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) variability that is realistic in clinical practice. Complementary to the quantitative analysis, the qualitative visual inspection was conducted for distinct CBCT scans from 250 patients with high anatomical variability

Experiments show that the drone can fly a half-circle with 1.5m radius within 2 seconds with only 30cm error at the end of the circle without any position feedback. The result shows that the drone can complete the track of 15 gates with a speed of 1.5m/s which is faster than the speeds exhibited at the 2016 and 2017 IROS autonomous drone races.

Adversarial Learning for Image Forensics Deep Matching with Atrous Convolution (Yaqi Liu - 8 September, 2018)
Constrained image splicing detection and localization (CISDL) is a newly proposed challenging task for image forensics, which investigates two input suspected images and identifies whether one image has suspected regions pasted from the other. Our framework mainly consists of three building blocks: 1) the deep matching network based on atrous convolution (DMAC) aims to generate two high-quality candidate masks which indicate the suspected regions of the two input images, 2) the detection network is designed to rectify inconsistencies between the two corresponding candidate masks, 3) the discriminative network drives the DMAC network to produce masks that are hard to distinguish from ground-truth ones. Extensive experiments, conducted on 21 generated testing sets and two public datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the superior performance of DMAC.

Jointly Localizing and Describing Events for Dense Video Captioning (Yehao Li - 23 April, 2018)
A valid question is how to temporally localize and then describe events, which is known as "dense video captioning." In this paper, we present a novel framework for dense video captioning that unifies the localization of temporal event proposals and sentence generation of each proposal, by jointly training them in an end-to-end manner. More remarkably, we obtain a new record: METEOR of 12.96% on ActivityNet Captions official test set.

Monocular camera systems are prevailing in intelligent transportation systems, but by far they have rarely been used for dimensional purposes such as to accurately estimate the localization information of a vehicle. By integrating a series of advanced computer vision techniques including foreground extraction, edge and line detection, etc., and by utilizing deep learning networks for fine-grained vehicle model classification, we developed an algorithm which can estimate vehicles location (position, orientation and boundaries) within the environment down to 3.79 percent position accuracy and 2.5 degrees orientation accuracy

Adversarial Complementary Learning for Weakly Supervised Object Localization (Xiaolin Zhang - 18 April, 2018)
With such an adversarial learning, the two parallel-classifiers are forced to leverage complementary object regions for classification and can finally generate integral object localization together. The merits of ACoL are mainly two-fold: 1) it can be trained in an end-to-end manner; 2) dynamically erasing enables the counterpart classifier to discover complementary object regions more effectively. In particular, the Top-1 localization error rate on the ILSVRC dataset is 45.14%, which is the new state-of-the-art.

Convex Relaxations for Pose Graph Optimization with Outliers (Luca Carlone - 6 January, 2018)
Contrarily to existing approaches, our convex relaxations do not rely on the availability of an initial guess for the unknown poses, hence they are more suitable for setups in which such guess is not available (e.g., multi-robot localization, recovery after localization failure). We tested the proposed techniques in extensive simulations, and we show that some of the proposed relaxations are indeed tight (i.e., they solve the original nonconvex problem 10 exactly) and ensure accurate estimation in the face of a large number of outliers.

SLAC: A Sparsely Labeled Dataset for Action Classification and Localization (Hang Zhao - 26 December, 2017)
This paper describes a procedure for the creation of large-scale video datasets for action classification and localization from unconstrained, realistic web data. The scalability of the proposed procedure is demonstrated by building a novel video benchmark, named SLAC (Sparsely Labeled ACtions), consisting of over 520K untrimmed videos and 1.75M clip annotations spanning 200 action categories. Using our proposed framework, annotating a clip takes merely 8.8 seconds on average. This represents a saving in labeling time of over 95% compared to the traditional procedure of manual trimming and localization of actions. On Kinetics, UCF-101 and HMDB-51, models pre-trained on SLAC outperform baselines trained from scratch, by 2.0%, 20.1% and 35.4% in top-1 accuracy, respectively when RGB input is used. On THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-v1.3, our localization model improves the mAP of baseline model by 8.6% and 2.5%, respectively.

Increasing the number of transceivers to four allows us to achieve 75$cm$ median localization error in a 72$m^2$ indoor area, compared with the 1.1$m$ median localization error achieved by LiFS using 11 transceivers in a 70$m^2$ area.

The proposed two localization approaches, DML and $k$ nearest neighbors based on reconstructed radio map (reKNN), were shown to achieve less than 4.3\ m and 3.7\ m mean localization error respectively in a typical office environment with an area of approximately 170\ m$^2$, while the unsupervised localization with perturbation algorithm was shown to achieve 4.7\ m mean localization error with 8 times more workload than the proposed methods. As for the room level localization application, both DML and reKNN can meet the requirement with at most 9\ m of localization error which is enough to tell apart different rooms with over 99\% accuracy.

Localization in Long-range Ultra Narrow Band IoT Networks using RSSI (Hazem Sallouha - 7 March, 2017)
Firstly, the RSSI has been used for fingerprinting localization where RSSI measurements of GPS anchor nodes have been used as landmarks to classify other nodes into one of the GPS nodes classes. Through measurements we show that a location classification accuracy of 100% is achieved when the classes of nodes are isolated. When classes are approaching each other, our measurements show that we can still achieve an accuracy of 85%. Furthermore, when the density of the GPS nodes is increasing, we can rely on peer-to-peer triangulation and thus improve the possibility of localizing nodes with an error less than 20m from 20% to more than 60% of the nodes in our measurement scenario. 90% of the nodes is localized with an error of less than 50m in our experiment with non-optimized anchor node locations.

This study formulates the concern on how wireless sensor networks can take advantage of the computational intelligent techniques using both single- and multi-objective particle swarm optimization (PSO) with an overall aim of concurrently minimizing the required time for localization, minimizing energy consumed during localization, and maximizing the number of nodes fully localized through the adjustment of wireless sensor transmission ranges while using TBL process. A parameter-study of the applied PSO variants is performed, leading to results that show algorithmic improvements of up to 32% in the evaluated objectives.

It is shown that CNNs operating on cepstrogram and generalized cross-correlogram inputs are able to more reliably estimate the instantaneous range and bearing of transiting motor vessels when the source localization performance of conventional passive ranging methods is degraded. The ensuing improvement in source localization performance is demonstrated using real data collected during an at-sea experiment.

Supervisor Localization of Discrete-Event Systems with Infinite Behavior (Renyuan Zhang - 24 October, 2017)
Specifically, we first employ Thistle and Wonham's supervisory control theory for DES with infinite behavior to compute a safety supervisor (for safety specifications) and a liveness supervisor (for liveness specifications), and then design a suitable localization procedure to decompose the safety supervisor into a set of safety local controllers, one for each controllable event, and decompose the liveness supervisor into a set of liveness local controllers, two for each controllable event. The localization procedure for decomposing the liveness supervisor is novel; in particular, a local controller is responsible for disabling the corresponding controllable event on only part of the states of the liveness supervisor, and consequently, the derived local controller in general has states number no more than that computed by considering the disablement on all the states

Challenges in Monocular Visual Odometry: Photometric Calibration, Motion Bias and Rolling Shutter Effect (Nan Yang - 7 June, 2018)
Monocular visual odometry (VO) and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) have seen tremendous improvements in accuracy, robustness and efficiency, and have gained increasing popularity over recent years. In this work, we evaluate these three aspects quantitatively on the state of the art of direct, feature-based and semi-direct methods, providing the community with useful practical knowledge both for better applying existing methods and developing new algorithms of VO and SLAM
