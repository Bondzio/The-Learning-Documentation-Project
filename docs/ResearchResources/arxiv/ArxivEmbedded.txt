Extended Bit-Plane Compression for Convolutional Neural Network Accelerators (Lukas Cavigelli - 1 October, 2018)
After the tremendous success of convolutional neural networks in image classification, object detection, speech recognition, etc., there is now rising demand for deployment of these compute-intensive ML models on tightly power constrained embedded and mobile systems at low cost as well as for pushing the throughput in data centers. We show that an average compression ratio of 4.4x relative to uncompressed data and a gain of 60% over existing method can be achieved for ResNet-34 with a compression block requiring <300 bit of sequential cells and minimal combinational logic.

Applying these networks to images demands a high computational effort and pushes the use of state-of-the-art networks on real-time video data out of reach of embedded platforms. This optimized inference procedure resulted in an average speed-up of 9.1x over cuDNN on the Tegra X2 platform at a negligible accuracy loss of <0.1% and no retraining of the network for a semantic segmentation application. Similarly, an average speed-up of 7.0x has been achieved for a pose detection DNN on static camera video surveillance data.

Exact size counting in uniform population protocols in nearly logarithmic time (David Doty - 13 May, 2018)
Crucially, unlike most published protocols with $Ï(1)$ states, our protocol is _uniform_: it uses the same transition algorithm for any population size, so does not need an estimate of the population size to be embedded into the algorithm. A sub-protocol is the first uniform sublinear-time leader election population protocol, taking $O(\log n \log \log n)$ time and $O(n^{18})$ states. The state complexity of both the counting and leader election protocols can be reduced to $O(n^{30})$ and $O(n^{9})$ respectively, while increasing the time to $O(\log^2 n)$.

The striking difference from most previous work on parameter binarization/quantization lies at different treatments of $1\times 1$ convolutions and $k\times k$ convolutions ($k>1$), where we only binarize $k\times k$ convolutions into binary patterns. Second, in light of the different functionalities of $1\times 1$ (data projection/transformation) and $k\times k$ convolutions (pattern extraction), we propose a new block structure codenamed the pattern residual block that adds transformed feature maps generated by $1\times 1$ convolutions to the pattern feature maps generated by $k\times k$ convolutions, based on which we design a small network with $\sim 1$ million parameters

We then show that ES-KMeans scales to larger corpora by applying it to the 5 languages of the Zero Resource Speech Challenge 2017 (up to 45 hours), where it performs competitively compared to the challenge baseline.

Neurostream: Scalable and Energy Efficient Deep Learning with Smart Memory Cubes (Erfan Azarkhish - 24 September, 2017)

NeuroCluster occupies only 8% of the total logic-base (LoB) die area in a standard HMC and achieves an average performance of 240 GFLOPS for complete execution of full-featured state-of-the-art (SoA) ConvNets within a power budget of 2.5W. Overall 11 W is consumed in a single SMC device, with 22.5 GFLOPS/W energy-efficiency which is 3.5X better than the best GPU implementations in similar technologies. The minor increase in system-level power and the negligible area increase make our PIM system a cost-effective and energy efficient solution, easily scalable to 955 GFLOPS with a small network of just four SMCs.
