On a Theorem of Kyureghyan and Pott (Minglong Qi - 5 October, 2018)
Kyureghyan and Alexander Pott (Designs, Codes and Cryptography, 29, 149-164, 2003), the linear feedback polynomials of the Sidel'nikov-Lempel-Cohn-Eastman sequences were determined for some special cases. When referring to that paper, we found that Corollary 4 and Theorem 2 of that paper are wrong because there exist many counterexamples for these two results. In this note, we give some counterexamples of Corollary 4 and Theorem 2 of that paper.

Faster individual discrete logarithms in finite fields of composite extension degree (Aurore Guillevic - 17 September, 2018)
Computing discrete logarithms in finite fields is a main concern in cryptography. The best algorithms in large and medium characteristic fields (e.g., {GF}$(p^2)$, {GF}$(p^{12})$) are the Number Field Sieve and its variants (special, high-degree, tower). The best algorithms in small characteristic finite fields (e.g., {GF}$(3^{6 \cdot 509})$) are the Function Field Sieve, Joux's algorithm, and the quasipolynomial-time algorithm

Orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal matrices have a long history of use in digital image processing, digital and wireless communications, cryptography and many other areas of computer science and coding theory. We call the matrices quasi-binary due to the fact that matrices have only two elements $a, b \in \mathbb{F}_q$, but those elements are not $0$ and $1$.

Formally Proved Security of Assembly Code Against Power Analysis: A Case Study on Balanced Logic (Pablo Rauzy - 17 June, 2015)
In his keynote speech at CHES 2004, Kocher advocated that side-channel attacks were an illustration that formal cryptography was not as secure as it was believed because some assumptions (e.g., no auxiliary information is available during the computation) were not modeled. The tools implementing our methods are then demonstrated in a case study on an 8-bit AVR smartcard for which we generate a provably protected present implementation that reveals to be at least 250 times more resistant to CPA attacks.

On the Heuristic of Approximating Polynomials over Finite Fields by Random Mappings (Rodrigo S. V. Martins - 6 April, 2016)
The study of iterations of functions over a finite field and the corresponding functional graphs is a growing area of research with connections to cryptography. The combination of these results and our experiments suggests that these polynomials behave like random mappings, extending a heuristic that was known only for degree $2$. We show numerically that the behaviour of Chebyshev polynomials of degree $d \geq 2$ over finite fields present a sharp contrast when compared to other polynomials in their respective classes.

In cryptography they must satisfy some criteria (balancedness, high nonlinearity, high algebraic degree, avalanche, or transparency) to provide best possible resistance against attacks. Since it is not even known how many semifields there are of order 256, we propose to build S-Boxes and APN functions via semifields pseudo-extensions of the form S_{2^4}^2, where S_{2^4} is any semifield of order 16 .

A new class of hyper-bent Boolean functions in binomial forms (Chunming Tang - 6 May, 2012)
Bent functions have been extensively studied due to their applications in cryptography, such as S-box, block cipher and stream cipher. Hyper-bent functions, as a special class of bent functions, were introduced by Youssef and Gong in 2001, which have stronger properties and rarer elements. In this paper, we consider functions defined over $\mathbb{F}_{2^n}$ by $f_{a,b}:=\mathrm{Tr}_{1}^{n}(ax^{(2^m-1)})+\mathrm{Tr}_{1}^{4}(bx^{\frac{2^n-1}{5}})$, where $n=2m$, $m\equiv 2\pmod 4$, $a\in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ and $b\in\mathbb{F}_{16}$. When $a\in \mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ and $(b+1)(b^4+b+1)=0$, with the help of Kloosterman sums and the factorization of $x^5+x+a^{-1}$, we present a characterization of hyper-bentness of $f_{a,b}$. Further, we use generalized Ramanujan-Nagell equations to characterize hyper-bent functions of $f_{a,b}$ in the case $a\in\mathbb{F}_{2^{\frac{m}{2}}}$.

An Extended Visual Cryptography Scheme (EVCS) was proposed by Ateniese et al. [3] to protect a binary secret image with meaningful (innocent-looking) shares. The minimum size of the extended matrix was obtained from a hypergraph coloring model and the scheme was designed for binary images only [3]. This scheme is an extension of the (n, n) VCS for multiple binary images proposed in Droste scheme [2].

Non-determinism in Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Replication (Christian Cachin - 19 December, 2016)
This paper distinguishes three models for dealing with non-determinism in replicated services, where some processes are subject to faults and arbitrary behavior (so-called Byzantine faults): first, a modular approach that does not require any changes to the potentially non-deterministic application (and neither access to its internal data); second, a master-slave approach, in which ties are broken by a leader and the other processes validate the choices of the leader; and finally, a treatment of applications that use cryptography and secret keys
