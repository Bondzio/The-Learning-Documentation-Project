Architecture Based Classification of Leaf Images (Mahmoud Sadeghi - 6 January, 2018)
Compared with previous studies, the proposed method combines extracted features of an image with specific knowledge of leaf architecture in the domain of botany to provide a comprehensive framework for both computer engineers and botanist. Finally, Based on the proposed method, experiments on the classification of the ImagerCLEF 2012 dataset has been performed with promising results.

Simulation and Analysis of Container Freight Train Operations at Port Botany (Daniel Guimarans - 21 December, 2015)
Over two million containers crossed the docks at Sydney's Port Botany in 2011/12; a figure that is forecast increase more than threefold by the end of the next decade. To cope with such large growth in volumes the NSW Government plans to double rail mode share at the port by the year 2020. Moreover: (i) the peak rail capacity of Port Botany is 1.78 million TEU per annum; over six times higher than 2011/12 rail volumes; (ii) there are no infrastructural impediments to the achievement of peak rail capacity; (iii) operational changes, not infrastructural investment, are the key to unlocking the potential of the port; (iv) Port Botany is well positioned to handle projected increases in container volumes over the next decade and beyond, including the 28% rail mode share target established by the New South Wales State Government.
