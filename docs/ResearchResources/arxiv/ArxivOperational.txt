New Thread Migration Strategies for NUMA Systems (O. G. Lorenzo - 28 September, 2018)
In previous works, monitoring information extracted from hardware counters at runtime has been used to characterise the behaviour of each thread in the parallel code in terms of the number of floating point operations per second, operational intensity, and latency of memory access. Our proposed strategies produce up to 70% improvement in scenarios where locality and affinity are low, there being a small degradation in performance for codes with high locality and affinity.

FermiNets: Learning generative machines to generate efficient neural networks via generative synthesis (Alexander Wong - 16 September, 2018)
What is most interesting is that, once a generator has been learned through generative synthesis, it can be used to generate not just one but a large variety of different, unique highly efficient deep neural networks that satisfy operational requirements. Experimental results for image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks illustrate the efficacy of generative synthesis in producing generators that automatically generate highly efficient deep neural networks (which we nickname FermiNets) with higher model efficiency and lower computational costs (reaching >10x more efficient and fewer multiply-accumulate operations than several tested state-of-the-art networks), as well as higher energy efficiency (reaching >4x improvements in image inferences per joule consumed on a Nvidia Tegra X2 mobile processor)

Differential Evolution Algorithm Aided Turbo Channel Estimation and Multi-User Detection for G.Fast Systems in the Presence of FEXT (Jiankang Zhang - 15 June, 2018)
The ever-increasing demand for broadband Internet access has motivated the further development of the digital subscriber line to the G.fast standard in order to expand its operational band from 106 MHz to 212 MHz. In this paper, we propose a novel differential evolution algorithm (DEA) aided turbo channel estimation (CE) and multi-user detection (MUD) scheme for the G.fast upstream including the frequency band up to 212 MHz, which is capable of approaching the optimal Cramer-Rao lower bound of the channel estimate, whilst approaching the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) MUD's performance associated with perfect channel state information, and yet only imposing about 5% of its computational complexity. Our extensive simulations show that 18 dB normalized mean square error gain is attained by the channel estimator and 10 dB signal-to-noise ratio gain can be achieved by the MUD upon exploiting this iteration gain

We analyze 6.5 TB of compressed binary tcpdump data representing 12 hours of network traffic. Our major contributions can be summarized in: 1) reporting the anomalies observed in real, up-to-date traffic from a large academic network environment, and documenting problems in research that may lead to wrong results due to misinterpretations of data or misconfigurations in software; 2) assessing the quality of data by analyzing the potential and the real problems in the capture process.

A Systematic Approach for Exploring Tradeoffs in Predictive HVAC Control Systems for Buildings (Joshua Gluck - 4 May, 2017)
Therefore, to understand the various factors affecting the energy usage, and to optimize the operational efficiency of building HVAC systems, energy analysts and architects often create simulations (e.g., EnergyPlus or DOE-2), of buildings prior to construction or renovation to determine energy savings and quantify the Return-on-Investment (ROI). We validate our framework on a real-world occupancy dataset spanning 6 months for 235 rooms in a large university office building.

Methods and Metrics for Fair Server Assessment under Real-Time Financial Workloads (Giorgis Georgakoudis - 30 December, 2014)
With increasing energy costs and the financial services sector growth, emerging financial analytics workloads may incur extremely high operational costs, to meet their latency targets. We deploy our methodology and metrics to compare a microserver with ARM cores against two servers with x86 cores, running the same real-time financial analytics workload. a 100% QoS in terms of timely option pricing, with as little as 55% of the energy consumed by the Sandy Bridge server.

An Abstract Interpretation-based Model of Tracing Just-In-Time Compilation (Stefano Dissegna - 28 October, 2015)
We show that our framework is more general than the model of tracing compilation introduced by Guo and Palsberg [2011] based on operational bisimulations.

Pseudo Dynamic Transitional Modeling of Building Heating Energy Demand Using Artificial Neural Network (S. Paudel - 17 November, 2014)
In addition, novel pseudo dynamic transitional model is introduced, which consider time dependent attributes of operational power level characteristics and its effect in the overall model performance is outlined. The results show the coefficients of correlation in static and pseudo dynamic neural network model of 0.82 and 0.89 (with energy consumption error of 0.02%) during the learning phase, and 0.61 and 0.85 during the prediction phase respectively

Optimal Adaptive Random Multiaccess in Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (Nicolo Michelusi - 20 February, 2015)
It is shown numerically that the SNE typically achieves near-optimal performance, within 3% of the optimal policy, at a fraction of the complexity, and two operational regimes of EH-networks are identified and analyzed: an energy-limited scenario, where energy is scarce and the channel is under-utilized, and a network-limited scenario, where energy is abundant and the shared wireless channel represents the bottleneck of the system.

Slepian-Wolf Coding for Broadcasting with Cooperative Base-Stations (Roy Timo - 10 November, 2014)
We establish the model's information-theoretic limits in two operational modes: In Mode 1, the helper BSs are given information about the channel codeword transmitted by the main BS, and in Mode 2 they are provided correlated side information about the source. Optimal codes for Mode 1 use \emph{hash-and-forward coding} at the helper BSs; while, in Mode 2, optimal codes use source codes from Wyner's \emph{helper source-coding problem} at the helper BSs. We prove the optimality of both approaches by way of a new list-decoding generalisation of [8, Thm. 6], and, in doing so, show an operational duality between Modes 1 and 2.

Strategy Derivation for Small Progress Measures (Maciej Gazda - 19 May, 2015)
We provide a novel operational interpretation of progress measures, and modify the algorithm so that it derives the winning strategies for both players in one pass. This reduces the upper bound on strategy derivation for SPM to $O(dm \cdot (n/\lfloor d / 2 \rfloor)^{\lfloor d/2 \rfloor})$.

Fault-Tolerant Approximate Shortest-Path Trees (Davide BilÃ² - 4 November, 2016)
However, to reduce operational and set-up costs, a network should be small in size, and this conflicts with the requirement of being resilient. In particular, for an $n$-vertex non-negatively weighted graph, and for any constant $\varepsilon >0$, we design two structures of size $O(\frac{n \log n}{\varepsilon^2})$ which guarantee $(1+\varepsilon)$-stretched paths from the selected source also in the presence of an edge/vertex failure. This favorably compares with the currently best known solutions, which are for the edge-failure case of size $O(n)$ and stretch factor 3, and for the vertex-failure case of size $O(n \log n)$ and stretch factor 3
