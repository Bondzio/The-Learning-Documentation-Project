Comparison of U-net-based Convolutional Neural Networks for Liver Segmentation in CT (Hans Meine - 9 October, 2018)
Using a set of 219 liver CT datasets with reference segmentations from liver surgery planning, we evaluate the performance of several neural network classifiers based on 2D and 3D U-net architectures. An interesting observation is that slice-wise approaches perform surprisingly well, with mean and median Dice coefficients above 0.97, and may be preferable over 3D approaches given current hardware and software limitations.

Relation Schema Induction using Tensor Factorization with Side Information (Madhav Nimishakavi - 15 November, 2016)
Given a set of documents from a specific domain (e.g., medical research journals), how do we automatically build a Knowledge Graph (KG) for that domain? Automatic identification of relations and their schemas, i.e., type signature of arguments of relations (e.g., undergo(Patient, Surgery)), is an important first step towards this goal. Through extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, we find that SICTF is not only more accurate than state-of-the-art baselines, but also significantly faster (about 14x faster).

Automatic 3D liver location and segmentation via convolutional neural networks and graph cut (Fang Lu - 10 May, 2016)
Purpose Segmentation of the liver from abdominal computed tomography (CT) image is an essential step in some computer assisted clinical interventions, such as surgery planning for living donor liver transplant (LDLT), radiotherapy and volume measurement. For the MICCAI-Sliver07 test set, the calculated mean ratios of volumetric overlap error (VOE), relative volume difference (RVD), average symmetric surface distance (ASD), root mean square symmetric surface distance (RMSD) and maximum symmetric surface distance (MSD) are 5.9%, 2.7%, 0.91%, 1.88 mm, and 18.94 mm, respectively. In the case of 20 3Dircadb data, the calculated mean ratios of VOE, RVD, ASD, RMSD and MSD are 9.36%, 0.97%, 1.89%, 4.15 mm and 33.14 mm, respectively

Adverse Events in Robotic Surgery: A Retrospective Study of 14 Years of FDA Data (Homa Alemzadeh - 20 July, 2015)
We analyzed the adverse events data related to robotic systems and instruments used in minimally invasive surgery, reported to the U.S. FDA MAUDE database from January 2000 to December 2013. During the study period, 144 deaths (1.4% of the 10,624 reports), 1,391 patient injuries (13.1%), and 8,061 device malfunctions (75.9%) were reported. The numbers of injury and death events per procedure have stayed relatively constant since 2007 (mean = 83.4, 95% CI, 74.2-92.7). Surgical specialties, for which robots are extensively used, such as gynecology and urology, had lower number of injuries, deaths, and conversions per procedure than more complex surgeries, such as cardiothoracic and head and neck (106.3 vs. 232.9, Risk Ratio = 2.2, 95% CI, 1.9-2.6). Device and instrument malfunctions, such as falling of burnt/broken pieces of instruments into the patient (14.7%), electrical arcing of instruments (10.5%), unintended operation of instruments (8.6%), system errors (5%), and video/imaging problems (2.6%), constituted a major part of the reports. In 1,104 (10.4%) of the events, the procedure was interrupted to restart the system (3.1%), to convert the procedure to non-robotic techniques (7.3%), or to reschedule it to a later time (2.5%)

Robotic Arm for Remote Surgery (Steven Dinger - 22 July, 2013)
The investigation and testing of remote surgery using a robotic arm is presented. The actuation system, or robotic arm, is based on a lead screw mechanism which can obtain a maximum speed of 0.28 m/s with a 1.5 degree/step for the end-effector. The infrared detection and encoder resolutions are below 0.6 mm/pixel and 0.4 mm respectively, which ensures the robotic arm can operate precisely. The control design results in a rise time of less than 0.5 s, a steady-state error of less than 1 mm and settling time of less than 1.4 s. The system accumulates, over an extended period of time, an error of approximately 4 mm due to inertial effects of the robotic arm

Stochastic Optimal Control for Modeling Reaching Movements in the Presence of Obstacles: Theory and Simulation (Arun Kumar Singh - 26 March, 2018)
In many human-in-the-loop robotic applications such as robot-assisted surgery and remote teleoperation, predicting the intended motion of the human operator may be useful for successful implementation of shared control, guidance virtual fixtures, and predictive control. The proposed framework can benefit a variety of applications that require teleoperation in cluttered spaces, including robot-assisted surgery

To Make a Robot Secure: An Experimental Analysis of Cyber Security Threats Against Teleoperated Surgical Robots (Tamara Bonaci - 12 May, 2015)

Our work seeks to answer this question by systematically analyzing possible cyber security attacks against Raven II, an advanced teleoperated robotic surgery system. We anticipate that the majority of attacks against telerobotic surgery will also be relevant to other teleoperated robotic and co-robotic systems.
