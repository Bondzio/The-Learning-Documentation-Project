Extended Bit-Plane Compression for Convolutional Neural Network Accelerators (Lukas Cavigelli - 1 October, 2018)
After the tremendous success of convolutional neural networks in image classification, object detection, speech recognition, etc., there is now rising demand for deployment of these compute-intensive ML models on tightly power constrained embedded and mobile systems at low cost as well as for pushing the throughput in data centers. We show that an average compression ratio of 4.4x relative to uncompressed data and a gain of 60% over existing method can be achieved for ResNet-34 with a compression block requiring <300 bit of sequential cells and minimal combinational logic.

We study the problem of patrolling the nodes of a network collaboratively by a team of mobile agents, such that each node of the network is visited by at least one agent once in every $I(n)$ time units, with the objective of minimizing the idle time $I(n)$. In particular, we consider 1-interval-connected ring networks and provide various patrolling algorithms for such networks, for $k=2$ or $k>2$ agents

Federated Learning with Non-IID Data (Yue Zhao - 2 June, 2018)

We first show that the accuracy of federated learning reduces significantly, by up to 55% for neural networks trained for highly skewed non-IID data, where each client device trains only on a single class of data. Experiments show that accuracy can be increased by 30% for the CIFAR-10 dataset with only 5% globally shared data.

A Machine Learning Approach To Prevent Malicious Calls Over Telephony Networks (Huichen Li - 7 April, 2018)
We first develop a TouchPal user interface on top of a mobile App to allow users tagging malicious calls. We then conduct a measurement study over three months of call logs, including 9 billion records. We design 29 features based on the results, so that machine learning algorithms can be used to predict malicious calls. We extensively evaluate different state-of-the-art machine learning approaches using the proposed features, and the results show that the best approach can reduce up to 90% unblocked malicious calls while maintaining a precision over 99.99% on the benign call traffic. We also conduct ablation analysis, which reveals that using 10 out of the 29 features can reach a performance comparable to using all features.
