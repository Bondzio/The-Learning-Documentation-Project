LIRS: Enabling efficient machine learning on NVM-based storage via a lightweight implementation of random shuffling (Zhi-Lin Ke - 10 October, 2018)
With the emerging non-volatile memory-based storage device, such as Intel Optane SSD, which provides fast random accesses, we propose a lightweight implementation of random shuffling (LIRS) to randomly shuffle the indexes of the entire training dataset, and the selected training instances are directly accessed from the storage and packed into batches.

Inter-Scanner Harmonization of High Angular Resolution DW-MRI using Null Space Deep Learning (Vishwesh Nath - 9 October, 2018)
To use these data, we propose a new network architecture, the null space deep network (NSDN), to simultaneously learn on traditional observed/truth pairs (e.g., MRI-histology voxels) along with repeated observations without a known truth (e.g., scan-rescan MRI). NSDN significantly improved absolute performance relative to histology by 3.87% over CSD and 1.42% over a recently proposed deep neural network approach. More-over, it improved reproducibility on the paired data by 21.19% over CSD and 10.09% over a recently proposed deep approach. Finally, NSDN improved gen-eralizability of the model to a third in vivo human scanner (which was not used in training) by 16.08% over CSD and 10.41% over a recently proposed deep learn-ing approach

Deep Geodesic Learning for Segmentation and Anatomical Landmarking (Neslisah Torosdagli - 6 October, 2018)
In step 1, we propose a deep neu- ral network architecture with carefully designed regularization, and network hyper-parameters to perform image segmentation without the need for data augmentation and complex post- processing refinement. In step 2, we formulate the landmark localization problem directly on the geodesic space for sparsely- spaced anatomical landmarks. In step 3, we propose to use a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to identify closely- spaced landmarks, which is rather difficult to obtain using other standard detection networks. We used a very challenging CBCT dataset of 50 patients with a high-degree of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) variability that is realistic in clinical practice. Complementary to the quantitative analysis, the qualitative visual inspection was conducted for distinct CBCT scans from 250 patients with high anatomical variability. We have also shown feasibility of the proposed work in an independent dataset from MICCAI Head-Neck Challenge (2015) achieving the state-of-the-art performance

Improving Myocardium Segmentation in Cardiac CT Angiography using Spectral Information (Steffen Bruns - 27 September, 2018)
We propose augmentation of the training data with virtual mono-energetic reconstructions from a spectral CT scanner which show different attenuation levels of the contrast agent. We train a 3D fully convolutional network (FCN) with 10 conventional CCTA images and corresponding virtual mono-energetic reconstructions acquired on a spectral CT scanner, and evaluate on 40 CCTA scans acquired on a conventional CT scanner. We show that training with data augmentation using virtual mono-energetic images improves upon training with only conventional images (Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) 0.895 $\pm$ 0.039 vs. 0.846 $\pm$ 0.125). In comparison, training with data augmentation using linear scaling improves the DSC to 0.890 $\pm$ 0.039. Moreover, combining the results of both augmentation methods leads to a DSC of 0.901 $\pm$ 0.036, showing that both augmentations lead to different local improvements of the segmentations

When the initial patches are extracted from nine scans the average Dice coefficient jumps to 0.86 and most of the false positives disappear. While this still falls short of state-of-the-art deep learning based segmentation of discs reported in literature, qualitative examination reveals that it does yield segmentation, which can be amended by expert clinicians with minimal effort to generate additional data for training improved deep models

If $k$ and $\frac{1}Îµ$ are fixed numbers, our framework generates, in nearly linear time ({\em i.e.,} $O(n(\log n)^{k+1}d)$), $O((\log n)^{k})$ $k$-tuple candidates for the $k$ mean or median points, and one of them induces a $(1+Îµ)$-approximation for $k$-CMeans or $k$-CMedian, where $n$ is the number of points

Security and Performance Considerations in ROS 2: A Balancing Act (Jongkil Kim - 24 September, 2018)
Robot Operating System (ROS) 2 is a ground-up re-design of ROS 1 to support performance critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs) using the Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware. Accordingly, the security of ROS 2 is highly reliant on the security of its DDS communication protocol. To accomplish this, we evaluate the latency and throughput of the communication protocols of ROS 2 in both wired and wireless networks, and measure the efficiency loss caused by the enabling of security protocols such as Virtual Private Network (VPN) and DDS security protocol in ROS 2 in both network setups. The result can be directly used by robotics developers to find the optimal and balanced settings of ROS 2 applications. The results of this work can be used to enhance the security of ROS 2.

Tunable Measures for Information Leakage and Applications to Privacy-Utility Tradeoffs (Jiachun Liao - 24 September, 2018)
This measure quantifies the maximal gain of an adversary in refining a tilted version of its posterior belief of any (potentially random) function of a data set conditioning on a released data set. For $Î±\in(1,\infty)$ this measure is shown to be the Arimoto channel capacity. We show that under a hard distortion constraint, both the optimal mechanism and the optimal tradeoff are invariant for any $Î±>1$, and the tunable leakage measure only behaves as either of the two extrema, i.e., mutual information for $Î±=1$ and maximal leakage for $Î±=\infty$.

We find evidence for positive changes triggered by the GDPR, with the ambiguity level, averaged over 8 metrics, improving in over 20.5% of the policies. Finally, we show that privacy policies cover more data practices, particularly around data retention, user access rights, and specific audiences, and that an average of 15.2% of the policies improved across 8 compliance metrics

Using our training technique based on similarity loss functions and patch prediction fusion we decrease the number of parameters in the network, reduce the complexity of the training process focusing the attention on less number of tasks, while mitigating the effects of data imbalance between labels and inaccuracies near patch borders. By taking advantage of these strategies we were able to perform fast image segmentation, using a network with less parameters than many state-of-the-art networks, being image size independent overcoming issues such as 3D vs 2D training and large vs small patch size selection, while achieving the top performance in segmenting brain tissue among all methods in the 2017 iSeg challenge

Internet Protocol Version 6: Dead or Alive? (Sumit Maheshwari - 17 August, 2018)
Internet Protocol (IP) is the narrow waist of multilayered Internet protocol stack which defines the rules for data sent across networks. IPv4 is the fourth version of IP and first commercially available for deployment set by ARPANET in 1983 which is a 32 bit long address and can support up to 232 devices. In April 2017, all Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) confirmed that IPv4 addresses are exhausted and cannot be allocated anymore implying any new organization requesting a block of Internet addresses will be allocated IPv6. Currently, when IPv4 is not available, and IPv6 is not adopted for around 20 years, the question arises whether IPv6 will still be accepted by the computer society or will it have an end of life soon with alternate better protocol such as ID based networks taking its place

In this work, we investigate i) how the routing affects the CapsNet model fitting, ii) how the representation by capsules helps discover global structures in data distribution and iii) how learned data representation adapts and generalizes to new tasks. Our investigation shows: i) routing operation determines the certainty with which one layer of capsules pass information to the layer above, and the appropriate level of certainty is related to the model fitness, ii) in a designed experiment using data with a known 2D structure, capsule representations allow more meaningful 2D manifold embedding than neurons in a standard CNN do and iii) compared to neurons of standard CNN, capsules of successive layers are less coupled and more adaptive to new data distribution.

Disambiguating Music Artists at Scale with Audio Metric Learning (Jimena Royo-Letelier - 3 October, 2018)
We explore the use of metric learning techniques to learn artist embeddings directly from audio, and using a dedicated homonym artists dataset, we compare our method with a recent approach that learn similar embeddings using artist classifiers. While both systems have the ability to disambiguate unknown artists relying exclusively on audio, we show that our system is more suitable in the case when enough audio data is available for each artist in the train dataset

Distributed transactional reads: the strong, the quick, the fresh \& the impossible (Alejandro Z. Tomsic - 3 October, 2018)
 We show that there is a three-way trade-off between them, which can be summarised as follows: (i) it is not possible to ensure at the same time order-preserving (e.g., causally-consistent) or atomic reads, Minimal Delay, and maximal freshness; thus, reading data that is the most fresh without delay is possible only in a weakly-isolated mode; (ii) to ensure atomic or order-preserving reads at Minimal Delay imposes to read data from the past (not fresh); (iii) however, order-preserving minimal-delay reads can be fresher than atomic; (iv) reading atomic or order-preserving data at maximal freshness may block reads or writes indefinitely.  Our impossibility results hold independently of other features of the database, such as update semantics (totally ordered or not) or data model (structured or unstructured)

Harnessing Correlations in Distributed Erasure Coded Key-Value Stores (Ramy E. Ali - 2 October, 2018)
In this paper, we study the storage cost of ensuring consistency for the case where the data versions are correlated, in contrast to previous work where data versions were treated as being independent. We provide multi-version code constructions that show that the storage cost can be significantly smaller than the previous constructions depending on the degree of correlation between the different versions of the data

Mixing patterns and individual differences in networks (George T. Cantwell - 2 October, 2018)
We introduce a network model that captures this type of variance in assortativity along with an expectation-maximization algorithm for fitting it to observed network data. The fit allows us to make best estimates of the preferences of individual nodes, define metrics to quantify individual variation in assortativity, perform sensitive community detection even in the absence of traditional assortative structure, and accurately predict missing data in unlabeled or partially labeled networks.

GLAD: GLocalized Anomaly Detection via Active Feature Space Suppression (Shubhomoy Das - 8 October, 2018)

Our experiments on synthetic and real-world data show the effectiveness of GLAD in learning the local relevance of ensemble members and discovering anomalies via label feedback.

Finally we point out related datasets for experiments and future research directions.

Predicate learning in neural systems: Discovering latent generative structures (Andrea E. Martin - 2 October, 2018)
But how do the structures that these models invoke arise in neural systems in the first place? To answer this question, we explain how a system can learn latent representational structures (i.e., predicates) from experience with wholly unstructured data. The ability to learn predicates from experience, to represent structures compositionally, and to extrapolate to unseen data offers an inroads to understanding and modeling the most complex human behaviors.

These methods let us train models which can not only provide more interpretable rationales for their predictions but also generalize better when training data is confounded or meaningfully different from test data (even adversarially so).
