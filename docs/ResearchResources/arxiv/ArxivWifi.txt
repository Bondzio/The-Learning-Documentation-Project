We conclude that the most challenging issue is related to the interoperability between DSRC and C-V2X in the 5.9 GHz band and the detection and avoidance of harmful adjacent and co-channel interference.

Modeling, Simulation and Fairness Analysis of Wi-Fi and Unlicensed LTE Coexistence (Morteza Mehrnoush - 28 April, 2018)
Coexistence of small-cell LTE and Wi-Fi networks in unlicensed bands at $5$ GHz is a topic of active interest, primarily driven by industry groups affiliated with the two (cellular and Wi-Fi) segments. 13 defined LTE-Licensed Assisted Access (LTE-LAA) mechanism for coexistence is the unlicensed LTE (LTE-U) Forum \cite{lteuforum} that prescribed Carrier Sense Adaptive Transmission (CSAT) whereby LTE utilizes the unlicensed band as a supplemental downlink unlicensed carrier (to enhance downlink data rate) to normal operation using licensed spectrum. The results show that as the number of Wi-Fi nodes increases, the Wi-Fi network in coexistence with LTE-DC with 0.5 duty cycling achieves a higher throughput than with an identical Wi-Fi network.

Analysis of CSAT performance in Wi-Fi and LTE-U Coexistence (Vanlin Sathya - 5 April, 2018)
In this paper, we study energy-based Carrier Sense Adaptive Transmission (CSAT) for use with LTE-U and investigate the performance in Wi-Fi/LTE-U coexistence using theoretical analysis and experimental verification using NI USRPs. According to the LTE-U forum specification, if an LTE-U base station (BS) finds a vacant channel, it can transmit for up to 20 ms and turn OFF its transmission for only 1 ms, resulting in a maximum duty cycle of 95%. It will start transmission by trying to transmit association packets (using carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)) through the 1 ms LTE-U OFF duration. Once LTE-U, using CSAT, detects Wi-Fi, it should scale back the duty cycle to 50%. We demonstrate in this paper, using an experimental platform as well as theoretical analysis, that if LTE-U is using a 95% duty cycle, energy based CSAT will take a much longer time to scale back the duty cycle due to the beacon drops and delays in the reception. Hence, in order to maintain association fairness with Wi-Fi, we propose that a LTE-U BS should not transmit at maximum duty cycles (95%), even if the channel is sensed to be vacant.

For LTE intra-technology inter-operator coexistence, both variants typically coexist well in the 5 GHz band, but for dense deployments, implementing listen-before-talk causes less interference.

Such an analysis reveals that (a) maximum coverage of no more than 700 m is obtained even when APs are deployed at 30 m height, and (b) operating APs at transmit power of more than 1 W is beneficial only at sparse deployment densities when rate is prioritized over coverage.

We find: (1) the use of Wi-Fi network maps the opening hours of the mall; (2) there is a weekly periodicity in users' visits to the mall; (3) around 60% of registered Wi-Fi users actively browse the Web and around 10% of them use Wi-Fi for accessing Web search engines; (4) people are likely to spend a relatively constant amount of time browsing the Web while their visiting duration may vary; (5) people tend to visit similar mall locations and Web content during their repeated visits to the mall; (6) the physical spatial context has a small but significant influence on the Web content that indoor users browse; (7) accompanying users tend to access resources from the same Web domains.

Rigorous and Practical Proportional-fair Allocation for Multi-rate Wi-Fi (Paul Patras - 19 May, 2015)
Recent experimental studies confirm the prevalence of the widely known performance anomaly problem in current Wi-Fi networks, and report on the severe network utility degradation caused by this phenomenon. Although a large body of work addressed this issue, we attribute the refusal of prior solutions to their poor implementation feasibility with off-the-shelf hardware and their imprecise modelling of the 802.11 protocol. Unlike earlier approaches, in this paper we introduce the first rigorous analytical model of 802.11 stations' throughput and airtime in multi-rate settings, without sacrificing accuracy for tractability. Results demonstrate that our proposal achieves up to 100\% utility gains, can double video streaming goodput and reduces TCP download times by 8x.

Closing the Blinds: Four Strategies for Protecting Smart Home Privacy from Network Observers (Noah Apthorpe - 18 May, 2017)

Bounded Mean-Delay Throughput and Non-Starvation Conditions in Aloha Network (Soung Chang Liew - 14 July, 2008)
The binary backoff factor of r = 2 is assumed in the majority of prior work, and in many practical multiple-access networks such as the Ethernet and WiFi. For slotted Aloha, the saturation throughput 0.3466 for r = 2 is reasonably close to the maximum of 1/e, and one could hardly raise objection to adopting r = 2 in the system. However, this paper shows that if mean queuing delay is to be bounded, then the sustainable throughput when r = 2 is only 0.2158, a drastic 41% drop from 1/e . Fortunately, the optimal setting of r = 1.3757 under the bounded mean-delay requirement allows us to achieve sustainable throughput of 0.3545, a penalty of only less than 4% relative to 1/e

Real-time public transport service-level monitoring using passive WiFi: a spectral clustering approach for train timetable estimation (Baoyang Song - 2 March, 2017)

The method we introduce makes use of the advantages of the high-frequency WiFi data, which provides very low-latency, universally-accessible information, while minimizing the impact of the noise in the data.
