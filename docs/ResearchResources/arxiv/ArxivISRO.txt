Realising the full potential of X-ray astronomy in the UK (P. Gandhi - 21 August, 2017)
With the successful launch of ISRO's AstroSat in 2015, and a few transformative results that emerged from JAXA's Hitomi mission in 2016, a new window has been opened into high sensitivity fast timing and high X-ray spectral resolution. To review the novel science possibilities enabled by recent and upcoming missions, and to discuss how to pave the way forward for X-ray astronomy in the UK, a specialist RAS discussion meeting was held in London on Feb 10 2017, summarised herein

Simulation of old open clusters for UVIT on ASTROSAT (Sindhu. N - 16 June, 2015)
Ultra Violet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) is one of the payloads on the first Indian multi wavelength satellite ASTROSAT expected to be launched by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in the year 2015. The colour magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and spatial appearances have been created using 10 filters of FUV channel (130 - 180 nm) and NUV channel (200 - 300nm) available for observations on the UVIT, for three old open clusters M67, NGC 188 and NGC 6791

TAUVEX: status in 2011 (Noah Brosch - 7 February, 2011)
After being denied a launch on a national Israeli satellite, and then not flying on the Spectrum X-Gamma (SRG) international observatory, it was manifested since 2003 as part of ISRO's GSAT-4 Indian satellite to be launched in the late 2000s. However, two months before the launch, in February 2010, it was dismounted from its agreed-upon platform. This proved to be beneficial, since GSAT-4 and its launcher were lost on April 15 2010 due to the failure of the carrier rocket's 3rd stage

Comparative study of different scattering geometries for the proposed Indian X-ray polarization measurement experiment using Geant4 (S. V. Vadawale - 2 March, 2010)
Recently, a proposal has been submitted to ISRO for a dedicated small satellite based experiment to carry out X-ray polarization measurement, which aims to provide the first X-ray polarization measurements since 1976

The Fe-Line Feature In The X-Ray Spectrum of Solar Flares: First Results From The SOXS Mission (Rajmal Jain - 13 December, 2006)
The SOXS Low Energy Detector (SLD) payload was designed, developed, and fabricated by the Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) in collaboration with the Space Application Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad and the ISRO Satellite Centre (ISAC), Bangalore of Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). The energy ranges of the Si PIN and CZT detectors are 4 - 25 keV and 4 - 56 keV respectively. The high sensitivity and sub-keV energy resolution of the Si PIN detector allows measuring the intensity, peak energy, and the equivalent width of the Fe-line complex at approximately 6.7 keV as a function of time in all ten M-class flares studied in this investigation. The peak energy (Ep) of the Fe-line feature varies between 6.4 and 6.7 keV with increasing in temperature from 9 to 58 MK. We found that the equivalent width (w) of the Fe-line feature increases exponentially with temperature up to 30 MK and then increases very slowly up to 40 Mk. It remains between 3.5 and 4 keV in the temperature range of 30 - 45 MK

Aerosol Characteristics at a high-altitude station Nainital during the ISRO-GBP Land Campaign-II (Auromeet Saha - 15 April, 2006)
During the second land campaign (LC-II) organised by ISRO-GBP, extensive ground-based measurements of aerosol characteristics were carried out over Manora Peak (29.4oN; 79.5oE; 1951 metres above mean sea level), Nainital (a high altitude station located in the Shivalik ranges of Central Himalayas) during the dry, winter season (December) of 2004

ELVIS - ELectromagnetic Vector Information Sensor (J. E. S. Bergman - 28 September, 2005)
The ELVIS instrument was recently proposed by the authors for the Indian Chandrayaan-1 mission to the Moon and is presently under consideration by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). ELVIS samples the full three-dimensional (3D) electric field vector, E(x,t), up to 18 MHz, with selective Nyqvist frequency bandwidths down to 5 kHz, and one component of the magnetic field vector, B(x,t), from a few Hz up to 100 kHz.As a transient detector, ELVIS is capable of detecting pulses with a minimum pulse width of 5 ns

Critical scaling of icosahedral medium-range order in CuZr metallic glass-forming liquids (Z. W. Wu - 19 October, 2016)
Furthermore, it is revealed that when icosahedral short-range order (ISRO) extends to medium-range length scale by connection, the atomic configurations of ISROs will be optimized from distorted ones towards more regular ones gradually, which significantly lowers the energies of ISROs and introduces geometric frustration simultaneously
