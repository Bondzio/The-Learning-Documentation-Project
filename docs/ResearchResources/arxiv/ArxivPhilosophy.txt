An Occam's Razor View on Learning Audiovisual Emotion Recognition with Small Training Sets (Valentin Vielzeuf - 8 August, 2018)
To design this model, the authors  followed a philosophy of simplicity, drastically limiting the number of parameters to learn from the target datasets, always choosing the simplest  earning methods: i) transfer learning and low-dimensional space embedding allows to reduce the dimensionality of the representations. We also highlight the inherent challenges of the AFEW dataset and the difficulty of model selection with as few as 383 validation  equences. The proposed real-time emotion classifier achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy of 60.64 % on the test set of AFEW, and ranked 4th at  he Emotion in the Wild 2018 challenge.

AXNet: ApproXimate computing using an end-to-end trainable neural network (Zhenghao Peng - 27 July, 2018)
Leveraging the philosophy of multi-task learning, AXNet can tremendously improve the invocation (proportion of safe-to-approximate samples) and reduce the approximation error. Experiment results show 50.7% more invocation and substantial cuts of training time when compared to existing neural network based approximate computing framework.

Exercising this philosophy, we show that the conventional network localization problem can be re-formulated to significantly reduce the search space, and that global rigidity, a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of unique solution in general graphs, is no longer necessary
