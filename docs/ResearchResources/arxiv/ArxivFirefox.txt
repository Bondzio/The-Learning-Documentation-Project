Timelines for In-Code Discovery of Zero-Day Vulnerabilities and Supply-Chain Attacks (Andrew J. Lohn - 31 August, 2018)
We analyze the version-to-version changes in three types of open source software (Mozilla Firefox, GNU/Linus, and glibc) to understand the rate at which the various pieces of code are amended and find that much of the revision behavior can be captured with a simple intuitive model. We use that model and the data from over a billion unique lines of code in 87 different versions of software to specify the bounds for in-code discoverability of vulnerabilities - from expertly hidden to obviously observable.

Horcrux: A Password Manager for Paranoids (Hannah Li - 10 October, 2017)
The prototype Horcrux client, implemented as a Firefox add-on, is split into two components, with code that has access to the user's master's password and any key material isolated into a small auditable component, separate from the complexity of managing the user interface. Our approach only works for websites that do not manipulate entered credentials in the browser client, so we conducted a large-scale experiment that found the technique appears to be compatible with over 98% of tested login forms.

Source File Set Search for Clone-and-Own Reuse Analysis (Takashi Ishio - 26 April, 2017)
To evaluate the effectiveness of this tool, we analyzed 75 cloned components in Firefox and Android source code. The tool took about two hours to report the original components from 10 million files in Debian GNU/Linux packages. Recall of the top-five components in the extracted lists is 0.907, while recall of a baseline using SHA-1 file hash is 0.773, according to the ground truth recorded in the source code repositories.

Abnormal Working Hours: Effect of Rapid Releases and Implications to Work Content (MaÃ«lick Claes - 12 April, 2017)
Firefox experiences proportionally more activity on weekends than Firefox OS (Cohen's d = 0.94). We find that switching to rapid releases has reduced weekend work (Cohen's d = 1.43) and working during the night (Cohen's d = 0.45). considering only individuals with Mozilla foundation email address, although, the effect sizes are smaller for weekends (Cohen's d = 0.64) and nights (Cohen's d = 0.23)

Tracking Protection in Firefox For Privacy and Performance (Georgios Kontaxis - 12 June, 2015)
We present Tracking Protection in the Mozilla Firefox web browser. We evaluate our approach and demonstrate a 67.5% reduction in the number of HTTP cookies set during a crawl of the Alexa top 200 news sites. Since Firefox does not download and render content from tracking domains, Tracking Protection also enjoys performance benefits of a 44% median reduction in page load time and 39% reduction in data usage in the Alexa top 200 news sites.

XSS-FP: Browser Fingerprinting using HTML Parser Quirks (Erwan Abgrall - 20 November, 2012)
This paper presents and evaluates a novel fingerprinting technique to determine the exact nature (browser type and version, eg Firefox 15) of a web-browser, exploiting HTML parser quirks exercised through XSS. Our experiments show that the exact version of a web browser can be determined with 71% of accuracy, and that only 6 tests are sufficient to quickly determine the exact family a web browser belongs to.
