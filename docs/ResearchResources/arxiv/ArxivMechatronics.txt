Design Criteria to Architect Continuous Experimentation for Self-Driving Vehicles (Federico Giaimo - 12 June, 2017)
The software powering today's vehicles surpasses mechatronics as the dominating engineering challenge due to its fast evolving and innovative nature. In addition, the software and system architecture for upcoming vehicles with automated driving functionality is already processing ~750MB/s - corresponding to over 180 simultaneous 4K-video streams from popular video-on-demand services

Scaling Agile Development in Mechatronic Organizations - A Comparative Case Study (Ulrik Eklund - 2 March, 2017)
We identified 108 goals and development practices supporting agile principles among the companies, most of them concerned with integration; therefrom, 26 agile practices are unique to the mechatronics domain to support adopting agile beyond pure software development teams. 16 of these practices are considered as key enablers, confirmed by our control cases.

Micro-lens array as tip-tilt sensor for single-mode fiber coupling (Philipp Hottinger - 9 August, 2018)
Furthermore we introduce an adaptive optics testbed, which we call the Koenigstuhl Observatory Opto-mechatronics Laboratory (KOOL), this testbed currently simulates vibrations at the Large Binocular Telescope, and in collaboration we have extended it to allow single-mode fiber coupling tests.
