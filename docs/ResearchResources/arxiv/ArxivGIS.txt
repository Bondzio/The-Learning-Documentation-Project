Gravitational instabilities in a protosolar-like disc III: molecular line detection and sensitivities (M. G. Evans - 10 October, 2018)
However, as these young objects are heavily embedded, confirmation of GIs has remained elusive. Therefore, we use the radiative transfer code LIME to produce line images of a $0.17\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ self-gravitating protosolar-like disc. If a small beamsize and appropriate molecular line are used then spatially resolving spirals in a protosolar-like disc should be possible with ALMA for an on-source time of 30 hr. Finally, we find that identifying finger-like features in PV diagrams of nearly edge-on discs, which are a direct indicator of spirals, is feasible with an on-source time of 19 hr, and hence likely offers the most promising means of confirming GI-driven spiral structure in young, embedded protoplanetary discs.

High Responsivity and Quantum Efficiency of Graphene / Silicon Photodiodes Achieved by Interdigitating Schottky and Gated Regions (Sarah Riazimehr - 13 July, 2018)
Here, a specific contact pattern scheme with interdigitated Schottky and graphene/insulator/silicon (GIS) structures is explored to experimentally demonstrate highly sensitive G/Si photodiodes. With the proposed design, an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of > 80 % is achieved for wavelengths ranging from 380 to 930 nm. A maximum EQE of 98% is observed at 850 nm, where the responsivity peaks to 635 mA/W, surpassing conventional Si p-n photodiodes

Simplifying Urban Data Fusion with BigSUR (Tom Kelly - 2 July, 2018)
BigSUR is an urban reconstruction algorithm which fuses GIS data, photogrammetric meshes, and street level photography, to create clean representative, semantically labelled, geometry. However, we have identified three problems with the system i) the street level photography is often difficult to acquire; ii) novel faÃ§ade styles often frustrate the detection of windows and doors; iii) the computational requirements of the system are large, processing a large city block can take up to 15 hours

Gravitational instabilities in a protosolar-like disc II: continuum emission and mass estimates (M. G. Evans - 1 June, 2017)
It is crucial to perform hydrodynamic and radiative transfer simulations of gravitationally unstable discs in order to assess the validity of GIs in such objects, and constrain optimal targets for future observations. We utilise the radiative transfer code LIME to produce continuum emission maps of a $0.17\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ self-gravitating protosolar-like disc. We use CASA to produce synthetic observations of 270 continuum emission maps generated across different frequencies, inclinations and dust opacities. We find that the spiral structure of our protosolar-like disc model is distinguishable across the majority of our parameter space after 1 hour of observation, and is especially prominent at 230$\,$GHz due to the favourable combination of angular resolution and sensitivity. Disc mass derived from the observations is sensitive to the assumed dust opacities and temperatures, and therefore can be underestimated by a factor of at least 30 at 850$\,$GHz and 2.5 at 90$\,$GHz

Constraints on cosmic-ray efficiency in the supernova remnant RCW 86 using multi-wavelength observations (M. Lemoine-Goumard - 26 July, 2012)

Beyond the expected Galactic diffuse background, no significant gamma-ray emission in the direction of RCW 86 is detected in any of the 0.1-1, 1-10 and 10-100 GeV Fermi-LAT maps. In the hadronic scenario, the derived HE upper limits together with the HESS measurements in the VHE domain can only be accommodated by a spectral index Gamma <= 1.8, i.e. We discuss these results in the light of existing estimates of the magnetic field strength, the effective density and the acceleration efficiency in RCW 86.

Migration of Gas Giant Planets in Gravitationally Unstable Disks (Scott Michael - 8 June, 2011)
As part of a larger study, we are using a 3D radiative hydrodynamics code to investigate how an embedded gas giant planet interacts with a gas disk that undergoes gravitational instabilities (GIs). This Letter presents results from simulations with a Jupiter-mass planet placed in orbit at 25 AU within a 0.14 $M_{\odot}$ disk. The disk spans 5 to 40 AU around a 1 $M_{\odot}$ star and is initially marginally unstable. When the planet is present from the beginning, its own wake stimulates growth of a particular global mode with which it strongly interacts, and the planet plunges inward six AU in about 10$^3$ years. Planet orbit eccentricities fluctuate rapidly between about 0.02 to 0.1 throughout the GI-active phases of the simulations.

Hard X-Ray Properties of Groups of Galaxies as Observed with ASCA (Kazuhiro Nakazawa - 7 February, 2007)
X-ray spectra of groups of galaxies, obtained with the GIS instrument onboard ASCA, were investigated for diffuse hard X-rays in excess of the soft thermal emission from their inter-galactic medium (IGM). In total, 18 objects with the IGM temperature of 0.7--1.7 keV were studied, including HCG 62 in particular. The IGM emission was represented by up to two temperature thermal models, which was determined in a soft energy band below 2.5 keV mainly by the SIS data. When extrapolated to a higher energy range of 4--8 keV, this thermal model under-predicted the background-subtracted GIS counts in HCG 62 and RGH 80 by > 2 sigma significance, even though the background uncertainties and the IGM modeling errors are carefully accounted. A hard excess could be also present in NGC 1399. The excess was successfully explained by a power-law model with a photon index ~ 2, or a thermal emission with a temperature exceeding ~ 3 keV. In HCG 62, the 2--10 keV luminosity of the excess hard component was found to be 5.5E41 erg/s at 2--10 keV, which is ~ 30% of the thermal IGM luminosity in 0.7--2.5 keV

The complex X-ray morphology of NGC 7618: A major group-group merger in the local Universe? (R. P. Kraft - 17 January, 2006)
Fitting a two-temperature model to the ASCA/GIS spectrum of the NGC 7618/UGC 12491 pair shows the presence of a second, much hotter ($T$=$\sim$2.3 keV) component. In the last case, we consider the possibility that NGC 7618 is falling into UGC 12491, or that both groups are falling into a gas poor cluster potential. There are significant problems with the first two models, however, and we conclude that the discontinuity and tail are most likely the result of ram pressure stripping of the NGC 7618 group as it falls into a larger dark matter potential.

The observed X-ray fluxes are in agreement with extrapolations of X-ray imaging observations of NGC 6334 by Chandra ACIS and ASCA GIS. Another possible model is the extended Chandra source of nonthermal emission from NGC 6334 that can also account for the hard X-ray emission observed by INTEGRAL. The possibility of emission from a young supernova remnant, as suggested by earlier infrared observations of NGC 6334, is constrained by the non-detection of 44Ti lines.

The Thermal Regulation of Gravitational Instabilities in Protoplanetary Disks II. Extended Simulations with Varied Cooling Rates (Annie C. Mejia - 1 July, 2004)
Our goal is to determine the asymptotic behavior of GIs and how it is affected by different constant cooling times. Initially, Rdisk = 40 AU, Mdisk = 0.07 Mo, M* = 0.5 Mo, and Qmin = 1.8. Sustained cooling, with tcool = 2 orps (outer rotation periods, 1 orp ~ 250 yrs), drives the disk to instability in ~ 4 orps. This calculation is followed for 23.5 orps.

Chandra ACIS and Newton EPIC Observations of the X-ray Luminous SN1978K in NGC 1313 (Eric M. Schlegel - 18 November, 2003)
The models that provided good fits to the ASCA SIS and GIS and the ROSAT PSPC spectra no longer do so for the ACIS or EPIC spectra. The best-fit model to the ACIS and EPIC spectra are dual hot plasma model (vmekal); one component is soft (T = 0.61+0.04-0.05 keV, 90% errors) and the other is harder (T=3.16+0.44-0.40 keV). For the varying abundances permitted within the model, only the Si abundance of the soft component differs from solar, with a value n(Si)(SN78K)/n(Si)(solar) = 3.20+1.80-1.90 (90% errors). From a ratio of the low- and high-T model fits to the Chandra and XMM-Newton spectra, we infer an exponent n of the ejecta density distribution, rho_ejecta ~ r^(-n), of ~5.2, adopting a circumstellar matter distribution exponent of s = 2 (rho_cs ~ r^(-s)). The 0.5-2 keV light curve shows essentially no decline; the 2-10 keV light curve, constructed only of the ASCA, XMM-Newton, and Chandra observations, shows a drop of 1.5 from the ASCA epoch

A Flux Limited Atlas of Galaxy Cluster Temperature Maps (R. Hank Donnelly - 7 October, 2003)
The temperature maps are derived from ASCA GIS observations using a common methodology to correct for the Point-Spread Function and calculate the local projected gas temperature in such a way so as to make each cluster directly comparable to all others in the sample. Variations in the temperature distribution, when present at > 90% confidence, are characterized by their severity and extent. We find that 70% of the clusters in our sample have significant variations in the projected gas temperature

ASCA and RXTE Observations of Non-Thermal X-ray Emission from Galactic Supernova Remnants: G156.2+5.7 (Thomas G. Pannuti - 27 August, 2003)
To illustrate this work, we examine the X-ray spectrum of the northwestern rim of an SNR suspected to have a non-thermal component to its X-ray emission, G156.2+5.7 (RX J04591+5147), over the energy range of approximately 0.7-12.0 keV using observations made by the ASCA GIS and the RXTE PCA. Both models give acceptable fits: the photon index derived from the fit made with the power law model, 2.0 (+0.2, -0.5), is comparable to values obtained for the bright rims of other SNRs with hard X-ray spectra. Using the SRCUT model, we derive a value of 2.42 (+0.24, -0.23) x 10^17 Hz for the cutoff frequency: based on this value and assuming a mean magnetic field strength of 14 microGauss, we estimate the cutoff energy of cosmic-ray electrons accelerated by G156.2+5.7 to be approximately 32 TeV

RXTE, ROSAT and ASCA Observations of G347.3-0.5 (RX J1713.7-3946): Probing Cosmic Ray Acceleration by a Galactic Shell-Type Supernova Remnant (Thomas G. Pannuti - 30 April, 2003)
By performing a joint spectral analysis of data from observations made of G347.3-0.5 using the ROSAT PSPC, the ASCA GIS and the RXTE PCA, we have fit the spectra of particular regions of this SNR (including the bright northwestern and southwestern rims, the northeastern rim and the interior diffuse emission) over the approximate energy range of 0.5 through 30 keV. Based on the parameters of the best fit to the spectra using the SRCUT model, we estimate the maximum energy of cosmic-ray electrons accelerated by the rims of G347.3-0.5 to be 19-25 TeV, assuming a magnetic field strength of 10 microGauss. Our fit derived from this model yields a maximum energy of only 8.8 TeV for the accelerated cosmic-ray electrons and a magnetic field strength of 150 microGauss. However, our derived ratio of volumes for TeV emission and X-ray emission (approximately 1000) is too large to be physically acceptable

PSR B1929+10 revisited in X-ray (Agnieszka Wozna - 21 February, 2003)
The most important new result from this work is derived from the spectral analysis=2E We found that the combined ROSAT PSPC and ASCA GIS spectrum can satisfactorily be described by a power-law as well as by a double black-body model but not by a single black-body model, as was presented earlier by Yancopoulos et al. (1994; ROSAT) and Wang et al. (1997; ASCA). Fitting the combined ROSAT/ASCA 0.1 - 10 keV spectrum by a power-law model we obtain a photon index of 2.54 +/- 0.12 and a neutral Hydrogen column density N_H towards the source of 9.8_{-1.0}^{+1.4} x 10^20 cm^-2. In both cases the derived N_H value is higher than that adopted in earlier works, but our result is consistent with the larger distance estimate of 331 +/- 10 pc from new parallax measurements performed by Brisken et al

The most notable object in the gamma-ray error box is the bright FR I radio galaxy NGC 6251. If 3EG J1621+8203 corresponds to NGC 6251, then it would be the second radio galaxy to be detected in high energy gamma rays, after Cen A, which provided the first clear evidence of the detection above 100 MeV of an AGN with a large-inclination jet

Study of the X-Ray Background Spectrum and its Large-Scale Fluctuation with ASCA (Akihiro Kushino - 12 May, 2002)
We studied the energy spectrum and the large-scale fluctuation of the X-ray background with the ASCA GIS based on the ASCA MSS and LSS observations. A total of 91 fields with Galactic latitude |b|>10 deg were selected with a sky coverage of 50 deg^2 and 4.2 Ms of exposure. For each field, sources brighter than \sim 2\times 10^{-13}\ergs (2-10 keV) were eliminated. Spectral fits with a single power-law model for the individual 0.7-10 keV spectra showed a significant excess below \sim 2 keV, which could be expressed by an additional thermal model with kT\simeq 0.4 keV or a steep power-law model with photon index GS\simeq 6. The 0.5-2 keV intensities of the soft thermal component varied significantly by 1Ï=52^{+4}_{-5}%, and showed a maximum toward the Galactic Center. As for the hard power-law component, an average photon index of 91 fields was obtained to be GH = 1.412\pm 0.007\pm 0.025 and the average 2-10 keV intensity was calculated as FH = (6.38\pm 0.04\pm 0.64)\times 10^{-8} \ergss. The 2-10 keV intensities shows a 1Ïdeviation of 6.49^{+0.56}_{-0.61}%, while deviation due to the NXB is 3.2%. (\sim 0.5 deg^2), even assuming a single \logn relation on the whole sky. Fluctuation of the spectral index was also examined, and it implied a large amount of hard sources and a substantial variation in the intrinsic source spectra (GS\simeq 1.1\pm 1.0).

Chandra and ASCA Observations of the X-ray-brightest T-Tauri Stars in the Rho Ophiuchi Cloud (Kensuke Imanishi - 14 February, 2002)
We present the Chandra ACIS and ASCA GIS results for a series of four long-term observations on DoAr 21, ROXs 21 and ROXs 31; the X-ray brightest T-Tauri stars (TTSs) in the Rho Ophiuchi cloud. In the four observations with a net exposure of ~600 ksec, we found six, three and two flares from DoAr 21, ROXs 21 and ROXs 31, respectively; hence the flare rate is fairly high. The spectra of DoAr 21 are well fitted with a single-temperature plasma model, while those of ROXs 21 and ROXs 31 need an additional soft plasma component. Since DoAr 21 is younger (~10^5 yr) than ROXs 21 and ROXs 31 (~10^6 yr), these results may indicate that the soft component gradually increases as T-Tauri stars age. An unusual giant flare is detected from ROXs 31. The temperature reaches its peak value before the flux maximum, and is nearly constant (4--5 keV) during the decay phase, indicating successive energy release during the flare

Non-thermal X-ray Emission: An Alternative to Cluster Cooling Flows? (Ian G. McCarthy - 14 November, 2001)

For five of the clusters that purportedly have massive cooling flows, the best-fit models have power-law components that contribute $\sim$ 30 % of the total flux (0.14 - 10.0 keV) within the central 3 arcminutes

Temperature Map of the Perseus Cluster of Galaxies Observed with ASCA (T. Furusho - 5 October, 2001)
We present two-dimensional temperature map of the Perseus cluster based on multi-pointing observations with the ASCA GIS, covering a region with a diameter of ~2^\circ. By correcting for the effect of the X-ray telescope response, the temperatures were estimated from hardness ratios and the complete temperature structure of the cluster with a spatial resolution of about 100 kpc was obtained for the first time. There is an extended cool region with a diameter of ~20' and kT ~5 keV at about 20' east from the cluster center. This region also shows higher surface brightness and is surrounded by a large ring-like hot region with kT > 7 keV, and likely to be a remnant of a merger with a poor cluster. Another extended cool region is extending outward from the IC 310 subcluster

ASCA Observations of Temperature Structure and Metal Distribution in the Perseus Cluster of Galaxies (H. Ezawa - 24 May, 2001)
Large-scale distributions of hot-gas temperature and Fe abundance in the Perseus cluster have been studied with multi-pointing observations by the GIS instrument on ASCA. Within a radius of 20' from the cluster center, the energy spectra requires two temperature components, in which the cool component indicates kT ~ 2 keV and the hot-component temperature shows a significant decline from about 8 keV to 6 keV toward the center. In the outer region of the cluster, the temperature shows a fluctuation with an amplitude of about 2 keV and suggest that a western region at ~16' from the cluster center is relatively hotter. As for the Fe abundance, a significant decline with radius is detected from 0.44 solar at the center to ~0.1 solar at a 50' offset region. If observed Fe-K line intensity within 4' from the center is suppressed by a factor of 2 due to the resonance scattering effect, the corrected Fe mass density follows the galaxy distribution

Chandra and ASCA X-ray Observations of the Radio Supernova SN1979C IN NGC 4321 (A. Ray - 27 April, 2001)
The useful exposure time was ~25 ks for the Solid-State Imaging Spectrometer (SIS), ~28 ks for the Gas Scintillation Imaging Spectrometer (GIS), and ~2.5 ks for Chandra's Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS). No point source was detected at the radio position of SN1979C in a 3' diameter half power response circle in the ASCA data. In the Chandra data, a source at the position of SN1979C is marginally detected at energies below 2 keV at a flux consistent with the ROSAT HRI detection in 1995. At energies above 2 keV, no source is detected with an upper limit of ~3x10^-14 erg/s/cm^-2. These measurements give the first ever x-ray flux limit of a Type IIL SN above 2 keV which is an important diagnostic of the outgoing shock wave ploughing through the circumstellar medium.

In contrast, the gas in Abell 1060 was well-mixed in an early period, which probably has prevented the development of the central cool component

These results strongly suggest that the X-ray spectra observed in 1997 arise via inverse Compton process alone. The X-ray spectra obtained in 1994 (Idesawa et al 1997), exhibiting a steeper slope than those in 1997, is thought to be contaminated by "synchrotron soft tail".

Separating Thermal and Nonthermal X-Rays in Supernova Remnants I: Total Fits to SN 1006 AD (K. K. Dyer - 20 October, 2000)
We describe the results of a much more stringent test: fitting spatially integrated ASCA GIS (0.6-8 keV) and RXTE PCA (3-10 keV) data with a combination of the synchrotron model SRESC newly ported to XSPEC and a new thermal shock model VPSHOCK. The new model can describe the continuum emission above 2 keV well, in both spatial distribution and spectrum. The synchrotron component rolls off smoothly from the extrapolated radio spectrum, with a characteristic rolloff frequency of 3.1E17 Hz, at which the spectrum has dropped about a factor of 6 below a powerlaw extrapolation from the radio spectrum. Comparison of TeV observations with new TeV model images and spectra based on the X-ray model fits gives a mean post-shock magnetic field strength of about 9 microGauss, implying (for a compression ratio of 4) an upstream magnetic field of 3 microGauss, and fixing the current energy content in relativistic electrons at about 7E48 ergs, resulting in a current electron-acceleration efficiency of about 5%. This total energy is about 100 times the energy in the magnetic field

Analysis of the GIS data, without explicitly including the cooling flow model, shows no substantial temperature drop at large radii (at half the virial radii) for the 3 systems. This is contrary to the recent results for 30 clusters by Markevitch et al. The gas mass fraction of these clusters are 10-15% within 1 Mpc, which suggests that baryonic fraction of about 20% including the stellar mass is a common level in galaxy groups and clusters.

X-Ray Evidence for Multiphase Hot Gas with Nearly Solar Fe Abundances in the Brightest Groups of Galaxies (David A. Buote - 27 August, 1999)
Upon fitting isothermal models (1T) jointly to the ASCA SIS and GIS spectra we obtain fits for most groups that are of poor or at best marginal quality and give very sub-solar metallicities similar to previous studies, <Z> = 0.29 +/- 0.12 Z_sun. Two-temperature models (2T) provide significantly better fits for 11 out of the 12 groups and in every case have metallicities that are substantially larger than obtained for the 1T models, <Z> = 0.75 +/- 0.24 Z_sun. A simple multiphase cooling flow model gives results analogous to the 2T models including large metallicities, <Z> = 0.65 +/- 0.17 Z_sun

Metallicity Gradients in the Intracluster Gas of Abell 496 (Renato A. Dupke - 23 February, 2000)
Simultaneous analysis of spectra from all ASCA instruments (SIS + GIS) shows that the iron abundance is 0.36 +- 0.03 solar 3-12' from the center of the cluster and rises ~50% to 0.53 +- 0.04 solar within the central 2'. The F-test shows that this abundance gradient is significant at the >99.99% level. We find spatial gradients in several abundance ratios, indicating that the fraction of iron from SN Ia increases toward the cluster center, with SN Ia accounting for ~50% of the iron mass 3-12' from the center and ~70% within 2'

X-Ray Evidence for Multiphase Hot Gas with Solar Abundances in the Brightest Elliptical Galaxies (David A. Buote - 22 June, 1999)
Broad-band spectral fitting of the ASCA SIS and GIS data accumulated within a radius of ~5 arcmin for each galaxy shows that isothermal models are unable to fit the SIS data near 1 keV. Two-temperature models provide excellent broad-band fits to both the SIS and GIS data of each galaxy with the relative abundances (except for NGC 4636) fixed at their solar values. A simple multiphase cooling flow model fits nearly as well as the two-temperature model for NGC 1399, NGC 4472, and NGC 5044

ASCA Observations of the Starburst-Driven Superwind Galaxy NGC 2146: Broad Band (0.6 - 9 keV) Spectral Properties (R. Della Ceca - 26 October, 1998)
We report ASCA GIS and SIS observations of the nearby (D = 11.6 Mpc), nearly edge-on, starburst galaxy NGC 2146. These X-ray spectral data complement ROSAT PSPC and HRI imaging discussed by Armus et al., 1995. The broad band (0.6-9 keV) X-ray spectrum of NGC 2146 is best described by a two component model: the soft X-ray emission with a Raymond-Smith thermal plasma model having a temperature of kT $\sim 0.8$ keV; the hard X-ray emission with a thermal plasma model having kT $\sim 8$ keV or a power-law model having a photon index of $\sim 1.7$. The soft (hard) thermal component provides about 30% (70%) of the total luminosity in the 0.5 - 2.0 keV energy band, while in the 2-10 keV energy range only the hard component plays a major role. We estimate that the mass outflow rate ($\sim$ 9 M$_{\odot}$ per year) is about an order of magnitude greater than the predicted rate at which supernovae and stellar winds return mass into the interstellar medium and, therefore, argue that the flow is strongly "mass-loaded" with material in and around the starburst

If the {\it CGRO} EGRET detection of this pulsar is real, considering the common trait that most EGRET-detected pulsars have a cooling spectrum in hard x-ray and gamma ray energy bands, the estimated {\it RXTE} upper limits indicate a deviation (low-energy turn-over) from a cooling spectrum starting from 20 keV or higher

The X-ray spectra are well fitted by a power law spectrum of a photon index of \error{-2.1}{0.1} with neutral H column of (\error{3.1}{0.6})${\rm \times 10^{21} cm^{-2}}$. Taking into account the interstellar absorption feature, this source is X-ray bright mainly above 1 keV suggesting either an AGN or a rotating neutron star

X-ray Constraints on Cluster Magnetic Fields (Mark Henriksen - 5 July, 1998)
The 0.7 - 10 keV spectra for all clusters were obtained with the Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics (ASCA) Gas Imaging Spectrometer (GIS). Upperlimits to the non-thermal X-ray emission are a factor of approximately 10 improvement over previous values. Lower limits to the average magnetic field derived from these upperlimits and the radio spectral parameters range from 0.08 - 0.30 microGauss. A seed intracluster field amplified by turbulence from galaxy motion through the intracluster medium should have an average value in the range of 0.1-0.2 (Goldman & Rephaeli, 1991; De Young, 1992), thus the lack of any detections makes it unlikely that field amplification is due to galaxy wakes

The Cosmic X-ray Background spectrum observed with ROSAT and ASCA (T. Miyaji - 28 March, 1998)

Comparison at E>1$keV shows general agreement within 10% in the Lockman Hole data and a 20-30% disagreement in the Lynx-3A data, indicating remaining observation-dependent systematic problems. In both cases, satisfactory fits have been found for the overall 0.1-10 keV spectrum with an extragalactic power-law component (or a broken power-law component with steepening at E<1 keV), a hard thermal component with plasma temperature of kT\approx 0.14 keV and a soft thermal component kT\approx 0.07 keV.

ASCA observations of Deep ROSAT fields - II. The 2-10keV AGN luminosity function (B. J. Boyle - 25 November, 1997)
We present additional optical spectroscopic identifications of sources identified in three deep ASCA GIS fields which also form part of a deep ROSAT survey. In total, 26 ASCA sources have been detected down to a 2-10keV flux limit of S = 5e-14 erg/cm/s. LDSS observations have increased the spectroscopic completeness of the survey to between 65 and 85 per cent, with identifications for up to 13 QSOs with broad emission lines and 6 objects with narrow emission lines. The present-epoch 2-10keV AGN X-ray luminosity function, Î¦(L_X), is best represented by a two power law function: Î¦(L_X) \propto L^{-3.0}, L*>10^{44.1}erg/s; $Î¦(L_X) \propto L^{-1.9}$, L*<10^{44.1}erg/s. Depending on the extent to which we extrapolate the z=0 AGN luminosity function, we predict a total contribution to the 2-10keV X-ray background from QSOs and narrow-emission-line galaxies which ranges from 48 per cent (for AGN with L>10^{42}erg/s) to 80 per cent (L>10^{39}erg/s).

Our spectral fits indicate that the SNR is isothermal (about 8.3 X 10^6 K), consistent with our ROSAT analysis results. The absorbing column density (about 2.9 X 10^21 cm^-2) obtained from these spectral fits is much smaller than expected for the nominal distance of 5 kpc, indicating that the line of sight toward VRO42.05.01 has an unusually low gas density

The X/gamma-ray spectral properties of NGC 7172 (Felix Ryde - 22 January, 1997)
We present a combined, non-simultaneous, ASCA GIS and CGRO OSSE spectrum of the Seyfert 2 galaxy, NGC 7172, and make broad band spectral fits. The only Seyfert 2 galaxy previously studied over such a broad band is NGC 4945. The best fit parameters are found to be $Î= 1.47 \pm 0.15$ and $\NH = (7.8 \pm 0.6) 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The spectral index of the underlying power law of NGC 7172 has therefore varied from 1.8 to 1.5 since the Ginga observations in 1989. For this simple model the e-folding energy at $88^{+65}_{-28}$ keV is relatively well constrained. The observed flux in the 2-10 keV range is $F_{2-10}=4.7 10^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, which corresponds to a small increase since the Ginga measurement in October 1989.

The results of the experimental tests with real WCE video frames show the good performance of the proposed approach, when elastic deformations of the small intestine are involved in successive frames, and its superiority with respect to a multiscale affine image registration, which accounts for rigid-like deformations only and discards elastic deformations.

Using former maps, geographers intend to study the evolution of the land cover in order to have a prospective approach on the future landscape; predictions of the future land cover, by the use of older maps and environmental variables, are usually done through the GIS (Geographic Information System). These methodologies have been tested on two real areas on which the land cover is known at various dates; this allows us to emphasize the benefit of these two statistical approaches compared to GIS and to discuss the way GIS could be improved by the use of statistical models.

The Thermal Regulation of Gravitational Instabilities in Protoplanetary Disks III. Simulations with Radiative Cooling and Realistic Opacities (A. C. Boley - 6 July, 2006)
We address the following aspects of disk evolution: the strength of gravitational instabilities under realistic cooling, mass transport in the disk that arises from GIs, comparisons between the gravitational and Reynolds stresses measured in the disk and those expected in an alpha-disk, and comparisons between the SED derived for the disk and SEDs derived from observationally determined parameters

The Effects of Metallicity and Grain Size on Gravitational Instabilities in Protoplanetary Disks (Kai Cai - 13 April, 2006)
Our latest simulations of disks undergoing gravitational instabilities (GIs) with realistic radiative cooling indicate that protoplanetary disks with lower metallicity generally cool faster and thus show stronger overall GI-activity. Nevertheless, GIs may still play an important role in a hybrid scenario, compatible with the observed metallicity trend, where structure created by GIs accelerates planet formation by core accretion.

The Network Analysis of Urban Streets: A Dual Approach (Sergio Porta - 9 November, 2004)
The application of the network approach to the urban case poses several questions in terms of how to deal with metric distances, what kind of graph representation to use, what kind of measures to investigate, how to deepen the correlation between measures of the structure of the network and measures of the dynamics on the network, what are the possible contributions from the GIS community

The Thermal Regulation of Gravitational Instabilities in Disks Around Young Stars (Annie C. Mejia - 22 April, 2004)
GIs fragment into clumps when the cooling time is on the order of the local orbital time, but the clumps are short-lived. GIs are an effective angular momentum and mass transport mechanism, and during their onset, they can reproduce the mass transport rates necessary to trigger FU Ori outbursts.
