Optimizing the Human-Machine Partnership with Zooniverse (Lucy Fortson - 25 September, 2018)
Since the launch in 2007 of the Galaxy Zoo project, the Zooniverse platform has enabled significant contributions across many disciplines; e.g., in ecology, humanities, and astronomy. To cope with the larger datasets looming on the horizon such as astronomy's Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) or the 100's of TB from ecology projects annually, Zooniverse has been researching a system design that is optimized for efficiency in task assignment and incorporating human and machine classifiers into the classification engine

Granted that big data science is a new science what are its foundations as compared to conventional topics in Physics, Chemistry or Biology? Or, is it similar to astronomy or nuclear science? What are the technological and engineering implications and how these can be advantageously used to augment business intelligence, for example? Will the industry adopt the changes due to tactical advantages? How can BD success stories be carried over elsewhere? How will BD affect the Computer Science and other curricula?

ASTROMLSKIT: A New Statistical Machine Learning Toolkit: A Platform for Data Analytics in Astronomy (Snehanshu Saha - 29 April, 2015)
Classical problems in Astronomy are compounded by accumulation of astronomical volume of complex data, rendering the task of classification and interpretation incredibly laborious. The focus of the paper is the applicability and efficacy of various machine learning algorithms like K Nearest Neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), decision tree (DT), Support Vector Machine (SVM), NaÃ¯ve Bayes and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in analysis and inference of the decision theoretic problems in Astronomy

Persistent, Global Identity for Scientists via ORCID (August E. Evrard - 22 February, 2015)
Scientists have an inherent interest in claiming their contributions to the scholarly record, but the fragmented state of identity management across the landscape of astronomy, physics, and other fields makes highlighting the contributions of any single individual a formidable and often frustratingly complex task. In this essay, we outline the benefits of a unique scholarly identifier with persistent value on a global scale and we review astronomy and physics engagement with the Open Researcher and Contributor iD (ORCID) service as a solution.

Application of Lossless Data Compression Techniques to Radio Astronomy Data flows (Tim Natusch - 22 May, 2014)
The modern practice of Radio Astronomy is characterized by extremes of data volume and rates, principally because of the direct relationship between the signal to noise ratio that can be achieved and the need to Nyquist sample the RF bandwidth necessary by way of support. By examining the statistical nature of typical data flows and applying well known techniques from the field of Information Theory the following work shows that lossless compression of typical radio astronomy data flows is in theory possible

Level Set Estimation from Compressive Measurements using Box Constrained Total Variation Regularization (Akshay Soni - 8 October, 2012)
Estimating the level set of a signal from measurements is a task that arises in a variety of fields, including medical imaging, astronomy, and digital elevation mapping. We demonstrate the performance of our approach, relative to existing state-of-the-art techniques for level set estimation from compressive measurements, via several simulation examples.
