Ambulance Emergency Response Optimization in Developing Countries (Justin J. Boutilier - 16 January, 2018)
We traveled to Dhaka, Bangladesh, the sixth largest and third most densely populated city in the world, to conduct field research resulting in the collection of two unique datasets that inform our approach. Second, we find that significant improvements in emergency response times can be achieved by re-locating a small number of outposts and that the performance of the current system could be replicated using only 30% of the resources. In particular, they are able to capture three times more demand while reducing the median response time by 42% due to increased routing flexibility offered by nimble vehicles on a larger road network

The Tropospheric Scintillation Prediction based on measured data for earth-to-satellite link for Bangladeshi climatic condition (Md. Sakir Hossain - 26 October, 2017)
Four major cities, named Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi and Sylhet, of Bangladesh are selected for prediction of scintillation. It is also found that the SFD varies from 3 dB to 13 dB depending on the frequency in used

Estimation of Rain Attenuation at EHF bands for Earth-to-Satellite Links in Bangladesh (S Md Sakir Hossain - 26 October, 2017)
The rain attenuations of the two bands are predicted for the four main regions of Bangladesh using ITU rain attenuation model. It is observed that the attenuation due to rain in the Q/V band reaches up to 150 dB which is much higher than that of the currently used Ka band. The attenuation varies from 40 dB to 170 dB depending on the months

Cholera forecast for Dhaka, Bangladesh, with the 2016 El NiÃ±o (Pamela P. Martinez - 4 July, 2016)
Thus, the current strong El NiÃ±o has the potential to significantly increase cholera risk this year in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where the last five years have experienced low seasons of the disease. To examine this possibility and produce a forecast for the city, we considered two models for the transmission dynamics of cholera: a statistical model previously developed for the disease in this region, and a process-based model presented here that includes the effect of SST anomalies in the force of infection and is fitted to extensive cholera surveillance record between 1995 and 2010. Prediction accuracy was evaluated with 'out-of-fit' data from the same surveillance efforts, by comparing the total number of cholera cases observed for the season to those predicted by model simulations 8 to 12 months ahead, starting in January each year. An increase above the third quantile in cholera cases is expected for the period of Aug - Dec 2016 with 92% and 87% probability respectively for the two models

Role of non-timber forest products in sustaining forest-based livelihoods and rural households' resilience capacity in and around protected area- a Bangladesh study (S. A. Mukul - 1 April, 2015)
This article attempts to explore the contribution of NTFPs in sustaining forest-based rural livelihood in and around a protected area of Bangladesh, and their potential role in enhancing households resilience capacity. 27 percent households of the area received at least some cash benefit from the collection, processing and selling of NTFPs, and NTFPs contribute as HHs primary, supplementary and emergency sources of income. NTFPs also constituted an estimated 19 percent of HHs net annual income, and were the primary occupation for about 18 percent of the HHs

Rain Attenuation Prediction for Terrestrial Microwave Link in Bangladesh (Sakir Hossain - 19 June, 2014)
Using ITU rain model for terrestrial microwave communication, the rain attenuation is predicted for five major cities of Bangladesh, namely Dhaka, Chittagong, Rajshahi, Sylhet, and Khulna. A horizontally polarized signal encounters 15% more rain attenuation than that of vertically polarized signal. It is also found that attenuation in Rajshahi is about 20% lesser than that in Sylhet. Thus, the horizontally polarized transmission in Rajshahi experiences about 5% less attenuation than the vertically polarized transmission in Sylhet.
