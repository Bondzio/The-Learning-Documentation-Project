The 30-Year Cycle In The AI Debate (Jean-Marie Chauvet - 8 October, 2018)
Many existing tech companies -- including the giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft -- have opened new research labs. This paper reviews briefly the track-record in AI and Machine Learning and finds this pattern of early dramatic successes, followed by philosophical critique and unexpected difficulties, if not downright stagnation, returning almost to the clock in 30-year cycles since 1958.

The Privacy Policy Landscape After the GDPR (Thomas Linden - 22 September, 2018)
Via a user study with 530 participants on Amazon Mturk, we discover that the visual presentation of privacy policies has slightly improved in limited data-sensitive categories in addition to the top European websites. We also find that the readability of privacy policies suffers under the GDPR, due to almost a 30% more sentences and words, despite the efforts to reduce the reliance on passive sentences. We find evidence for positive changes triggered by the GDPR, with the ambiguity level, averaged over 8 metrics, improving in over 20.5% of the policies. Finally, we show that privacy policies cover more data practices, particularly around data retention, user access rights, and specific audiences, and that an average of 15.2% of the policies improved across 8 compliance metrics

Analyzing Social Book Reading Behavior on Goodreads and how it predicts Amazon Best Sellers (Suman Kalyan Maity - 19 September, 2018)
We analyze the collective reading behavior on Goodreads platform and quantify various characteristic features of the Goodreads entities to identify differences between these Amazon best sellers (ABS) and the other non-best selling books. We then develop a prediction model using the characteristic features to predict if a book shall become a best seller after one month (15 days) since its publication. On a balanced set, we are able to achieve a very high average accuracy of 88.72% (85.66%) for the prediction where the other competitive class contains books which are randomly selected from the Goodreads dataset. Our method primarily based on features derived from user posts and genre related characteristic properties achieves an improvement of 16.4% over the traditional popularity factors (ratings, reviews) based baseline methods. We are able to achieve quite good results with very high average accuracy of 87.1% and as well a high ROC for ABS vs GCAN. For ABS vs HRHR, our model yields a high average accuracy of 86.22%.

Large Scale Language Modeling: Converging on 40GB of Text in Four Hours (Raul Puri - 10 August, 2018)

SciTokens: Capability-Based Secure Access to Remote Scientific Data (Alex Withers - 12 July, 2018)

By improving the interoperability and security of scientific workflows, SciTokens 1) enables use of distributed computing for scientific domains that require greater data protection and 2) enables use of more widely distributed computing resources by reducing the risk of credential abuse on remote systems.

Performance Measurements of Supercomputing and Cloud Storage Solutions (Michael Jones - 1 August, 2017)
The performance tests used span the gamut of parallel I/O scenarios, ranging from single-client, single-node Amazon S3 and Lustre performance to a large-scale, multi-client test designed to demonstrate the capabilities of a modern storage appliance under heavy load. These results show that, when parallel I/O is used correctly (i.e., many simultaneous read or write processes), full network bandwidth performance is achievable and ranged from 10 gigabits/s over a 10 GigE S3 connection to 0.35 terabits/s using Lustre on a 1200 port 10 GigE switch

The Cloudlet Bazaar Dynamic Markets for the Small Cloud (Ranjan Pal - 13 February, 2018)
The recent emergence of the small cloud (SC), both in concept and in practice, has been driven mainly by issues related to service cost and complexity of commercial cloud providers (e.g., Amazon) employing massive data centers. A proposed solution to this problem recommends the sharing of resources between competing SCs to alleviate the resource inelasticity issues that might arise [1]. Based on this idea, a recent effort ([2]) proposed SC-Share, a performance-driven static market model for competitive small cloud environments that results in an efficient market equilibrium jointly optimizing customer QoS satisfaction and SC revenue generation. We answer our previous question in the affirmative through the use of Arrow and Hurwicz's disequilibrium process [3], [4] in economics, and the gradient play technique in game theory that allows us to iteratively converge upon efficient and stable market equilibria

Microtask crowdsourcing for disease mention annotation in PubMed abstracts (Benjamin M Good - 8 August, 2014)
Recent studies have shown that workers on microtask crowdsourcing platforms such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk (AMT) can, in aggregate, generate high-quality annotations of biomedical text. After several iterations, we arrived at a protocol that reproduced the annotations of the 593 documents in the training set of this gold standard with an overall F measure of 0.872 (precision 0.862, recall 0.883). The output can also be tuned to optimize for precision (max = 0.984 when recall = 0.269) or recall (max = 0.980 when precision = 0.436). Each document was examined by 15 workers, and their annotations were merged based on a simple voting method. In total 145 workers combined to complete all 593 documents in the span of 1 week at a cost of $.06 per abstract per worker

D4M 2.0 Schema: A General Purpose High Performance Schema for the Accumulo Database (Jeremy Kepner - 14 July, 2014)
Non-traditional, relaxed consistency, triple store databases are the backbone of many web companies (e.g., Google Big Table, Amazon Dynamo, and Facebook Cassandra). The D4M 2.0 Schema has been applied with little or no customization to cyber, bioinformatics, scientific citation, free text, and social media data. The D4M 2.0 Schema is simple, requires minimal parsing, and achieves the highest published Accumulo ingest rates. The benefits of the D4M 2.0 Schema are independent of the D4M interface. Any interface to Accumulo can achieve these benefits by using the D4M 2.0 Schema

Early Observations on Performance of Google Compute Engine for Scientific Computing (Zheng Li - 23 December, 2013)
Considering that fundamental performance benchmarking is the strategy of early-stage evaluation of new Cloud services, we followed the Cloud Evaluation Experiment Methodology (CEEM) to benchmark GCE and also compare it with Amazon EC2, to help understand the elementary capability of GCE for dealing with scientific problems. For example, compared to Amazon's EC2 service, GCE may better suit applications that require frequent disk operations, while it may not be ready yet for single VM-based parallel computing
