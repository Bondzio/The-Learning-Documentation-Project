A New Probe of Cosmic Strings at LIGO and Mid-band: Gravitational Lensing Fringe (Sunghoon Jung - 9 October, 2018)
But if they are augmented by mid-frequency detectors such as Atom Interferometer (AI) and Big Bang Observatory (BBO), the broadband ($f \simeq 0.1-1000$ Hz) detections can have significantly better fringe resolutions, hence enhanced sensitivities to the unconstrained parameter space ($GÎ¼\lesssim 10^{-7}$) of cosmic strings.

The jamming transition as a paradigm to understand the loss landscape of deep neural networks (Mario Geiger - 3 October, 2018)
This transition shares direct similarities with the jamming transition by which particles form a disordered solid as the density is increased, which also occurs in certain classes of computational optimization and learning problems such as the perceptron. We also study a quantity $Î$ which characterizes how well ($Î<0$) or badly ($Î>0$) a datum is learned. At the critical point it is power-law distributed, $P_+(Î)\simÎ^Î¸$ for $Î>0$ and $P_-(Î)\sim(-Î)^{-Î³}$ for $Î<0$, with $Î¸\approx0.3$ and $Î³\approx0.2$

Branching random walk in random environment with random absorption wall (You Lv - 13 September, 2018)
Let the random barrier function (the random absorption wall) is $g_i(\mathcal{L}):=ai^Î±-S_i,$ where $i$ present the generation. We show that there exists a critical value $a_c>0$ such that if $a>a_c,Î±=\frac{1}{3}$, the survival probability is positive almost surly and if $a<a_c,Î±=\frac{1}{3}$ ,the survival probability is zero almost surely. Moreover, if we denote $Z_n$ is the total populations in $n$-th generation in the new system (with barrier),under some conditions, we show $\ln\mathbb{P}_{\mathcal{L}}(Z_n>0)/n^{1/3}$ will converges to a negative constant almost surely if $Î±\in[0,\frac{1}{3})$.

A Unified Analysis of Four Cosmic Shear Surveys (Chihway Chang - 28 August, 2018)
To assess the robustness of the existing cosmic shear results, we present in this paper a unified analysis of four of the recent cosmic shear surveys: the Deep Lens Survey (DLS), the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS), the Science Verification data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES-SV), and the 450 deg$^{2}$ release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-450). For our fiducial analysis choice, considering a Gaussian covariance, conservative scale cuts, assuming no baryonic feedback contamination, identical cosmological parameter priors and intrinsic alignment treatments, we find the constraints (mean, 16% and 84% confidence intervals) on the parameter $S_{8}\equiv Ï_{8}(Î©_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}$ to be $S_{8}=0.94_{-0.045}^{+0.046}$ (DLS), $0.66_{-0.071}^{+0.070}$ (CFHTLenS), $0.84_{-0.061}^{+0.062}$ (DES-SV) and $0.76_{-0.049}^{+0.048}$ (KiDS-450). The combined constraints are $S_{8}=0.79^{+0.042}_{-0.041}$, which is in good agreement with the first year of DES cosmic shear results and recent CMB constraints from the Planck satellite.

Quantitative analysis on the disparity of regional economic development in China and its evolution from 1952 to 2000 (Jianhua Xu - 28 June, 2018)
What is the reason for this? We think it is mainly due to different analytic approaches, perspectives, spatial units, statistical indicators and different periods for studies. From 1952 to 1978, except for the "Great Leap Forward" period, comparative disparity basically assumes a upward trend and it assumed a slowly downward trend from 1979 to1990. Afterwards from 1991 to 2000 the disparity assumed a slowly upward trend again; (c) A comparison between Shanghai and Guizhou shows that absolute inter-provincial disparity has been quite big for years; and (d) The Hurst exponent (H=0.5) in the period of 1966-1978 indicates that the comparative inter-provincial disparity of economic development showed a random characteristic, and in the Hurst exponent (H>0.5) in period of 1979-2000 indicates that in this period the evolution of the comparative inter-provincial disparity of economic development in China has a long-enduring characteristic.

How To Extract Fashion Trends From Social Media? A Robust Object Detector With Support For Unsupervised Learning (Vijay Gabale - 28 June, 2018)
Moreover, state-of-the-art object detectors do not have any functionality to ingest large amount of unlabeled data available on social media in order to fine tune object detectors with labeled datasets. In this work, we show application of a generic object detector, that can be pretrained in an unsupervised manner, on 24 categories from recently released Open Images V4 dataset. We first train the base architecture of the object detector using unsupervisd learning on 60K unlabeled photos from 24 categories gathered from social media, and then subsequently fine tune it on 8.2K labeled photos from Open Images V4 dataset. On 300 X 300 image inputs, we achieve 72.7% mAP on a test dataset of 2.4K photos while performing 11% to 17% better as compared to the state-of-the-art object detectors

We highlight principles we adopted in this process (approachable design, simplicity, extensibility and accessibility), insights we learned from showing the kit at workshops (66 participants) and how users interacted with the project on GitHub over a 12-month period (Nov 2016 - Nov 2017). We find that the project succeeds in attracting novice users (40% of users who forked the project are new to GitHub) and a variety of demographics are interested in prototyping use cases such as home automation, task delegation, teaching and learning.

Previous approaches that a empt to design revenue optimal auctions for the multi-dimensional settings fall short in at least one of the three aspects: 1) representation --- search in a space that probably does not even contain the optimal mechanism; 2) exactness --- finding a mechanism that is either not truthful or far from optimal; 3) domain dependence --- need a different design for different environment settings

What game are we playing? End-to-end learning in normal and extensive form games (Chun Kai Ling - 27 June, 2018)
Although recent work in AI has made great progress in solving large, zero-sum, extensive-form games, the underlying assumption in most past work is that the parameters of the game itself are known to the agents. In particular, we consider a regularized version of the game, equivalent to a particular form of quantal response equilibrium, and develop 1) a primal-dual Newton method for finding such equilibrium points in both normal and extensive form games; and 2) a backpropagation method that lets us analytically compute gradients of all relevant game parameters through the solution itself

We find that [O III] is intrinsically weak ($F_{\rm [OIII]}/F_{\rm HÎ²} \lesssim 0.04$), as it is typically found in luminous quasars with a strongly blueshifted C IV emission line ($\sim$2500 km s$^{-1}$ for APM 08279+5255).

A Single-Channel Architecture for Algebraic Integer Based 8$\times$8 2-D DCT Computation (A. Edirisuriya - 26 October, 2017)
The proposed architecture computes 8$\times$8 2-D DCT transform based on the Arai DCT algorithm. The design improves on the 4-channel AI DCT architecture that was published recently by reducing the number of integer channels to one and the number of 8-point 1-D DCT cores from 5 down to 2. The architecture offers exact computation of 8$\times$8 blocks of the 2-D DCT coefficients up to the FRS, which converts the coefficients from the AI representation to fixed-point format using the method of expansion factors. Post place-and-route results show a 20% reduction in terms of area compared to the 2-D DCT architecture requiring five 1-D AI cores. The area-time and area-time${}^2$ complexity metrics are also reduced by 23% and 22% respectively for designs with 8-bit input word length. The digital realizations are simulated up to place and route for ASICs using 45 nm CMOS standard cells. The maximum estimated clock rate is 951 MHz for the CMOS realizations indicating 7.608$\cdot$10$^9$ pixels/seconds and a 8$\times$8 block rate of 118.875 MHz.

Diffusion-based neuromodulation can eliminate catastrophic forgetting in simple neural networks (Roby Velez - 18 November, 2017)
While the prior work did show that modular ANNs suffered less from catastrophic forgetting, it was not able to produce ANNs that possessed task-specific functional modules, thereby leaving the main theory regarding modularity and forgetting untested. On the simple diagnostic problem from the prior work, diffusion-based neuromodulation 1) induces task-specific learning in groups of nodes and connections (task-specific localized learning), which 2) produces functional modules for each subtask, and 3) yields higher performance by eliminating catastrophic forgetting

XMM-Newton observation of the ultraluminous quasar SDSS J010013.02+280225.8 at redshift 6.326 (Yanli Ai - 17 May, 2017)
In this paper we present results for the quasar from a 65ks XMM-Newton observation, which well constrains its spectral shape. The quasar is clearly detected with a total of $\sim$ 460 net counts in the 0.2-10 keV band. The spectrum is characterised by a simple power-law model with photon index of $Î= 2.30^{+0.10}_{-0.10}$, and the intrinsic 2-10 keV luminosity is $3.14\times10^{45}$ erg $\text{s}^{-1}$. The 1 $Ï$ upper limit to any intrinsic absorption column density is $N_{H} = 6.07\times 10^{22} {\text{cm}}^{-2}$. We derive the X-ray-to-optical flux ratio $Î±_{\text{ox}}$ of $-1.74\pm$0.01, consistent with the values found in other quasars of comparable ultraviolet luminosity. We did not detect significant flux variations either in the XMM-Newton exposure or between XMM-Newton and XMM-Newton observations, which are separated by $\sim$ 8 months

Evolving understanding of Antarctic ice-sheet physics and ambiguity in probabilistic sea-level projections (Robert E. Kopp - 4 November, 2017)
We compare the new projections to past results using expert assessment and structured expert elicitation about AIS changes. Under high greenhouse gas emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 8.5), median projected 21st century GMSL rise increases from 79 to 146 cm. Without protective measures, revised median RSL projections would by 2100 submerge land currently home to 153 million people, an increase of 44 million. The use of a physical model, rather than simple parameterizations assuming constant acceleration of ice loss, increases forcing sensitivity: overlap between the central 90% of simulations for 2100 for RCP 8.5 (93-243 cm) and RCP 2.6 (26-98 cm) is minimal. By 2300, the gap between median GMSL estimates for RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6 reaches >10 m, with median RSL projections for RCP 8.5 jeopardizing land now occupied by 950 million people (vs. 167 million for RCP 2.6). The minimal correlation between the contribution of AIS to GMSL by 2050 and that in 2100 and beyond implies current sea-level observations cannot exclude future extreme outcomes

Assessing the Impact of Retreat Mechanisms in a Simple Antarctic Ice Sheet Model Using Bayesian Calibration (Kelsey L. Ruckert - 7 February, 2017)
Here, we calibrate a previously published and relatively simple AIS model, which neglects the effects of MICI and regional characteristics, using a combination of observational constraints and a Bayesian inversion method. Our results suggest that the model can approximate the process of MISI and reproduce the projected median melt from some previous expert assessments in the year 2100. Yet, our mean hindcast is roughly 3/4 of the observed data during the last interglacial period and our mean projection is roughly 1/6 and 1/10 of the mean from a model accounting for MICI in the year 2100

NPCs Vote! Changing Voter Reactions Over Time Using the Extreme AI Personality Engine (Jeffrey Georgeson - 17 September, 2016)
Can non-player characters have human-realistic personalities, changing over time depending on input from those around them? And can they have different reactions and thoughts about different people? Using Extreme AI, a psychology-based personality engine using the Five Factor model of personality, I answer these questions by creating personalities for 100 voters and allowing them to react to two politicians to see if the NPC voters' choice of candidate develops in a realistic-seeming way, based on initial and changing personality facets and on their differing feelings toward the politicians (in this case, across liking, trusting, and feeling affiliated with the candidates). After 16 test runs, the voters did indeed change their attitudes and feelings toward the candidates in different and yet generally realistic ways, and even changed their attitudes about other issues based on what a candidate extolled.

In contrast, we investigate and determine the most cost-effective way of obtaining high-quality multi-label annotations for temporal data such as videos.

We conclude that the optimal strategy is to ask as many questions as possible in a HIT (up to 52 binary questions after watching a 30-second video clip in our experiments). When compared with a one-question-per-video baseline, our method is able to achieve a 10% improvement in recall 76.7% ours versus 66.7% baseline) at comparable precision (83.8% ours versus 83.0% baseline) in about half the annotation time (3.8 minutes ours compared to 7.1 minutes baseline). We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by collecting multi-label annotations of 157 human activities on 1,815 videos.

Adopting the proton-density distribution of $^{12}$C known from the electron-scattering data, as well as the bare total nucleon-nucleon cross sections, and the real-to-imaginary-part ratios of the forward proton-proton elastic scattering amplitude available in the literatures, we determine the energy-dependent slope parameter $Î²_{\rm pn}$ of the proton-neutron elastic differential cross section so as to reproduce the existing $Ï_{\text{R}}$ and interaction-cross-section data for $^{12}$C+$^{12}$C over a wide range of incident energies. The Glauber model thus formulated is applied to calculate the $Ï_{\text{\tiny R}}$'s of $^{12}$C on a $^9$Be and $^{27}$Al targets at various incident energies. Applying our model to the $Ï_{\text{\tiny R}}$ and $Ï_{\text{\tiny CC}}$ for the "neutron-skin" $^{16}$C nucleus, we reconfirm the importance of measurements at incident energies below $100A$ MeV

The power-law spectral index remains constant during the flux variation.

If the same material causes the optical reddening (E(B-V)$\simeq$0.6 mag), it must be located outside the narrow line region with a dust-to-gas ratio similar to the average Galactic value. A broad Fe K$Î±$ line at $\simeq$6.7 keV with a width of $\sim$0.6 keV is detected in the low flux segment of the first 40 ks exposure, and is absent in the spectra of other segments; a narrow Fe K$Î±$ emission line $\sim$6.4 keV with a width of $\sim$0.1 keV is observed in the subsequent 20 ks segment, which has a count rate of 35% higher and is in the next day

Low Frequency Gravitational Wave Detection With Ground Based Atom Interferometer Arrays (W. Chaibi - 4 January, 2016)
Considering the km baseline of current optical detectors, a NN rejection of factor 2 could be achieved, and tested with existing AI array geometries. Considering a conservative NN model and the current developments in cold atom technology, we show that strain sensitivities below $1\times 10^{-19}/ \sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ in the $ 0.3-3 \ \text{Hz}$ frequency band can be within reach, with a peak sensitivity of $3\times 10^{-23}/ \sqrt{\text{Hz}} $ at $2 \ \text{Hz}$

On p-adic Mobius maps (Jinghua Yang - 3 December, 2015)
Furthermore, we prove that if a subgroup of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C}_{p})$ containing elliptic elements only, then all elements fix the same point in $\mathbb{H}_{Ber}$ without using the famous theorem--Cartan fixed point theorem, and this means that this subgroup has potentially good reduction. This part of work can be applied to study the convergence of the sequence of $p-$adic MÃ¶bius maps which can be viewed as a special cases of the work in \cite{CJE} and the discrete criteria of the subgroups of $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C}_{p})$.

Ab initio molecular dynamics with nuclear quantum effects at classical cost: ring polymer contraction for density functional theory (Ondrej Marsalek - 11 February, 2016)
By using density functional tight binding as a reference system, we show that our ab initio ring polymer contraction (AI-RPC) scheme gives rapid and systematic convergence to the full path integral density functional theory result. Combined with a multiple time step scheme using the same reference system, which allows the time step to be increased, our implementation is as fast as a typical classical ab initio molecular dynamics simulation and 35$\times$ faster than a full path integral calculation, while still exactly including the quantum sampling of nuclei

On Learning to Think: Algorithmic Information Theory for Novel Combinations of Reinforcement Learning Controllers and Recurrent Neural World Models (Juergen Schmidhuber - 30 November, 2015)
Unlike our previous model-building RNN-based RL machines dating back to 1990, the RNNAI learns to actively query its model for abstract reasoning and planning and decision making, essentially "learning to think." The basic ideas of this report can be applied to many other cases where one RNN-like system exploits the algorithmic information content of another. They are taken from a grant proposal submitted in Fall 2014, and also explain concepts such as "mirror neurons." Experimental results will be described in separate papers.

From the $D^+ \to K^0_L e^+ Î½_e$ differential decay rate distribution, the product of the hadronic form factor and the magnitude of the CKM matrix element, $f_{+}^{K}(0)|V_{cs}|$, is determined to be $0.728 \pm 0.006(\mathrm{stat.}) \pm 0.011(\mathrm{sys.})$.

Confirmation of a charged charmoniumlike state $Z_c(3885)^{\mp}$ in $e^+e^-\toÏ^{\pm}(D\bar{D}^*)^\mp$ with double $D$ tag ( BESIII Collaboration - 10 November, 2015)
With full reconstruction of the $D$ meson pair and the bachelor $Ï^{\pm}$ in the final state, we confirm the existence of the charged structure $Z_c(3885)^{\mp}$ in the $(D\bar{D}^*)^{\mp}$ system in the two isospin processes $e^+e^-\toÏ^+D^0D^{*-}$ and $e^+e^-\toÏ^+D^-D^{*0}$. By performing a simultaneous fit, the statistical significance of $Zc(3885)^{\mp}$ signal is determined to be greater than 10$Ï$, and its pole mass and width are measured to be $M_{\rm{pole}}$=(3881.7$\pm$1.6(stat.)$\pm$1.6(syst.))~MeV/$c^2$ and $Î_{\rm{pole}}$=(26.6$\pm$2.0(stat.)$\pm$2.1(syst.))~MeV, respectively. The Born cross section times the $(D\bar{D}^*)^{\mp}$ branching fraction ($Ï(e^+e^-\toÏ^{\pm}Z_{c}(3885)^{\mp}) \times Br(Z_{c}(3885)^{\mp}\to(D\bar{D}^*)^{\mp})$) is measured to be $(141.6\pm7.9(\text{stat.})\pm12.3(\text{syst.}))~\text{pb}$ at $\sqrt{s}=4.23$~GeV and $(108.4\pm6.9(\text{stat.})\pm8.8(\text{syst.}))~\text{pb}$ at $\sqrt{s}=4.26$~GeV.

Study of Dynamics of $D^0 \to K^- e^+ Î½_{e}$ and $D^0\toÏ^- e^+ Î½_{e}$ Decays ( BESIII Collaboration - 30 August, 2015)
From a study of the differential decay rates we obtain the products of hadronic form factor and the magnitude of the CKM matrix element $f_{+}^K(0)|V_{cs}|=0.7172\pm0.0025\pm 0.0035$ and $f_{+}^Ï(0)|V_{cd}|=0.1435\pm0.0018\pm 0.0009$. Combining these products with the values of $|V_{cs(d)}|$ from the SM constraint fit, we extract the hadronic form factors $f^K_+(0) = 0.7368\pm0.0026\pm 0.0036$ and $f^Ï_+(0) = 0.6372\pm0.0080\pm 0.0044$, and their ratio $f_+^Ï(0)/f_+^{K}(0)=0.8649\pm 0.0112\pm 0.0073$. The measured value of $f_+^{K(Ï)}(0) |V_{cs(d)}|$ and the lattice QCD value for $f^{K(Ï)}_+(0)$ are used to extract values of the CKM matrix elements of $|V_{cs}|=0.9601 \pm 0.0033 \pm 0.0047 \pm 0.0239$ and $|V_{cd}|=0.2155 \pm 0.0027 \pm 0.0014 \pm 0.0094$, where the third errors are due to the uncertainties in lattice QCD calculations of the form factors. Using the LCSR value for $f_+^Ï(0)/f_+^K(0)$, we determine the ratio $|V_{cd}|/|V_{cs}|=0.238\pm 0.004\pm 0.002\pm 0.011$, where the third error is from the uncertainty in the LCSR normalization

Power Allocation Strategy of Maximizing Secrecy Rate for Secure Directional Modulation Networks (Simin Wan - 6 February, 2018)
In this paper, given the beamforming vector of confidential messages and artificial noise (AN) projection matrix and total power constraint, a power allocation (PA) strategy of maximizing secrecy rate (Max-SR) is proposed for secure directional modulation (DM) networks. From simulation results, we find the following facts: in the medium and high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regions, compared with three typical PA parameters such $Î²=0.1, 0.5$, and $0.9$, the optimal PA shows a substantial SR performance gain with maximum gain percent up to more than $60\%$. Additionally, as the PA factor increases from 0 to 1, the achievable SR increases accordingly in the low SNR region whereas it first increases and then decreases in the medium and high SNR regions, where the SR can be approximately viewed as a convex function of the PA factor

Using Phone Sensors and an Artificial Neural Network to Detect Gait Changes During Drinking Episodes in the Natural Environment (Brian Suffoletto - 13 November, 2017)
We used an artificial neural network model to analyze associations between sensor features and eBACs in training (70% of the data) and validation and test (30% of the data) datasets. We analyzed 128 data points where both eBAC and gait-related sensor data was captured, either when not drinking (n=60), while eBAC was ascending (n=55) or eBAC was descending (n=13). 21 data points were captured at times when the eBAC was greater than the legal limit (0.08 mg/dl). Using a Bayesian regularized neural network, gait-related phone sensor features showed a high correlation with eBAC (Pearson's r > 0.9), and >95% of estimated eBAC would fall between -0.012 and +0.012 of actual eBAC

Long-Term Inertial Navigation Aided by Dynamics of Flow Field Features (Zhuoyuan Song - 13 October, 2017)
The performance of the proposed approach is first analyzed through Monte Carlo simulations in two artificial background flow fields, resembling real-world ocean circulation patterns, superposed with smaller-scale, turbulent components with Kolmogorov energy spectrum. For a 6-hour navigation with an automotive-grade inertial navigation system, the current-aided navigation scheme results in positioning estimates with under 3% uncertainty per distance traveled (UDT) in a turbulent, double-gyre flow field, and under 7.3% UDT in a turbulent, meandering jet flow field. Further evaluation with field test data and actual ocean simulation analysis demonstrates consistent performance for a 6-hour mission, positioning result with under 25% UDT for a 24-hour navigation when provided direct heading measurements, and terminal positioning estimate with 16% UDT at the cost of increased uncertainty at an early stage of the navigation.
