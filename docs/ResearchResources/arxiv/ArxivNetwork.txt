Visually-aware Collaborative Food Recommendation (Xiaoyan Gao - 11 October, 2018)
To address this challenging problem, we develop a dedicated neural network-based solution \emph{Hierarchical Attention based Food Recommendation} (HAFR) which is capable of: 1) capturing the collaborative filtering effect like what similar users tend to eat; 2) inferring a user's preference at the ingredient level; and 3) learning user preference from the recipe's visual image. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms several competing recommender solutions like Factorization Machine and Visual Bayesian Personalized Ranking with an average improvement of 12\%, offering promising results in predicting user preference on food.

Leveraging local network communities to predict academic performance (David Burstein - 10 October, 2018)

We used a very challenging CBCT dataset of 50 patients with a high-degree of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) variability that is realistic in clinical practice. Complementary to the quantitative analysis, the qualitative visual inspection was conducted for distinct CBCT scans from 250 patients with high anatomical variability

Rate-Accuracy Trade-Off In Video Classification With Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (Mohammad Jubran - 27 September, 2018)
This necessitates the transport of compressed video over networks and incurs significant overhead in bandwidth and energy consumption, thereby significantly undermining the deployment potential of such systems. Based on three CNN architectures and two action recognition datasets, we achieve 11%-94% saving in bitrate with marginal effect on classification accuracy. A model-based selection between multiple CNNs increases these savings further, to the point where, if up to 7% loss of accuracy can be tolerated, video classification can take place with as little as 3 kbps for the transport of the required compressed video information to the system implementing the CNN models.

Learning Depth with Convolutional Spatial Propagation Network (Xinjing Cheng - 4 October, 2018)
We can append this module to any output from a state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation networks to improve their performances. In practice, we further extend CSPN in two aspects: 1) take sparse depth map as additional input, which is useful for the task of depth completion; 2) similar to commonly used 3D convolution operation in CNNs, we propose 3D CSPN to handle features with one additional dimension, which is effective in the task of stereo matching using 3D cost volume. We experimented the proposed CPSN conjunct algorithms over the popular NYU v2 and KITTI datasets, where we show that our proposed algorithms not only produce high quality (e.g., 30% more reduction in depth error), but also run faster (e.g., 2 to 5x faster) than previous SOTA spatial propagation network. We also evaluated our stereo matching algorithm on the Scene Flow and KITTI Stereo datasets, and rank 1st on both the KITTI Stereo 2012 and 2015 benchmarks, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed module

Deep Residual Network for Off-Resonance Artifact Correction with Application to Pediatric Body Magnetic Resonance Angiography with 3D Cones (David Y Zeng - 28 September, 2018)
Methods: A residual convolutional neural network to correct off-resonance artifacts (Off-ResNet) was trained with a prospective study of 30 pediatric magnetic resonance angiography exams. Each exam acquired a short-readout scan (1.18 ms +- 0.38) and a long-readout scan (3.35 ms +- 0.74) at 3T. Results: Long-readout scans were on average 59.3% shorter than short-readout scans. Images from Off-ResNet had superior NRMSE, SSIM, and PSNR compared to uncorrected images across +-1kHz off-resonance (P<0.01). The proposed method had superior NRMSE over -677Hz to +1kHz and superior SSIM and PSNR over +-1kHz compared to autofocus (P<0.01). Radiologic scoring demonstrated that long-readout scans corrected with Off-ResNet were non-inferior to short-readout scans (P<0.01)

For the efficiency, our Transformer TTS network can speed up the training about 4.25 times faster compared with Tacotron2.

Infant brain MRI tissue segmentation is a complex deep learning task, where the white matter and gray matter of the developing brain at about 6 months of age show similar T1 and T2 relaxation times, having similar intensity values on both T1 and T2-weighted MRIs.

Scattering Networks for Hybrid Representation Learning (Edouard Oyallon - 17 September, 2018)
For supervised learning, we demonstrate that the early layers of CNNs do not necessarily need to be learned, and can be replaced with a scattering network instead. Specifically, even applying a shallow cascade of small-windowed scattering coefficients followed by 1$\times$1-convolutions results in AlexNet accuracy on the ILSVRC2012 classification task. Moreover, by combining scattering networks with deep residual networks, we achieve a single-crop top-5 error of 11.4% on ILSVRC2012

Compared to FCN, EDANet is 11 times faster and has 196 times fewer parameters, while it achieves a higher the mean of intersection-over-union (mIoU) score without any additional decoder structure, context module, post-processing scheme, and pretrained model. Our network can run on resolution 512x1024 inputs at the speed of 108 and 81 frames per second on a single GTX 1080Ti and Titan X, respectively.

Probabilistic Argumentation and Information Algebras of Probability Potentials on Families of Compatible Frames (Juerg Kohlas - 8 October, 2018)
The operations of aggregating different PAS and of transport of a PAS from one frame to another induce an algebraic structure on the family of potentials on the f.c.f, an algebraic structure which is similar to valuation algebras related to Bayesian networks, but more general. As a consequence the well-known local computation architectures of Bayesian networks for inference apply also for the potentials on f.c.f
