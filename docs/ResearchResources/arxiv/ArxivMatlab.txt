Reply on Comment on "High resolution coherence analysis between planetary and climate oscillations" by S. Holm (Nicola Scafetta - 25 May, 2018)

Moreover, Holm could not replicate my result also in his figure 5 because there he used the basic Welch MSC algorithm by erroneously equating it to MSC-CCA. Herein I clarify step-by-step how to proceed with the correct analysis, and I fully confirm the 95% significance of my results

Full Virtualization of Renault's Engine Management Software and Application to System Development (Dirk Von Wissel - 16 February, 2018)
The framework is heavily based on MATLAB/Simulink and the idea of model-based development, which facilitates the carry-over and carry-across of application software between software projects. In the Renault EMS architecture software is composed in to about 20 functions, such as Air System, Combustion etc. The Renault EMS development process includes basically the following steps [5]. 1. Specification of about 200 generic configurable modules per ECU using MATLAB/Simulink. 2. 3. To insure software quality, this step is repeatedly performed with steps 1 and 2, based on the simulation capabilities of MATLAB/Simulink. 4. 5. 6. In contrast to step 3, the interactions of all modules and interactions with the system environment are visible then and subject to testing. Critical assessment of the above process shows that there is a considerable delay between delivery of a set of specifications to the software project team (at the end of step 3) and system-level tests based on an ECU that runs entire software (step 6)

A Software-equivalent SNN Hardware using RRAM-array for Asynchronous Real-time Learning (Aditya Shukla - 6 April, 2017)
Second, we show that the hardware emulates software at every stage by comparison of SPICE (circuit$-$simulator) with MATLAB (mathematical SNN algorithm implementation in software) implementations. As an example, the hardware shows 97.5 per cent accuracy in classification which is equivalent to software for a Fisher$-$Iris dataset. We show that an increasingly realistic memristor model slightly reduces the hardware performance (85 per cent), which highlights the need to engineer RRAM characteristics specifically for SNN.

A Proposed Algorithm for Minimum Vertex Cover Problem and its Testing (Gang Hu - 24 October, 2016)
Tested by the attached MATLAB programs, Stage 1 of the algorithm is applicable to, i.e., yields a proved minimum vertex cover for, about 99.99% of the tested 610,000 graphs of order 16 and 99.67% of the tested 1,200 graphs of order 32, and Stage 2 of the algorithm is applicable to all of the above tested graphs. It is proved that Stage 1 and Stage 2 of the algorithm run in $O(n^{5+logn})$ and $O(n^{3(5+logn)/2})$ time respectively, where $n$ is the order of input graph. Because there is no theoretical proof yet that Stage 2 is applicable to all graphs, further stages of the algorithm are proposed, which are in a general form that is consistent with Stages 1 and 2.

First-Class Variability Modeling in Matlab/Simulink (Arne Haber - 25 August, 2014)
Thus, variability has to be dealt with in all phases of the development process, in particular during model-based development of software-intensive functionality using Matlab/Simulink. Currently, variability is often encoded within a functional model leading to so called 150%-models which easily become very complex and do not scale for larger product lines. To counter these problems, we propose a modular variability modeling approach for Matlab/Simulink based on the concept of delta modeling [8, 9, 24]

Generalised Object Detection and Semantic Analysis: Casino Example using Matlab (Othman Ahmad - 17 September, 2011)
Matlab version 7.1 had been used to detect playing cards on a Casino table and the suits and ranks of these cards had been identified. Pass 1 detects rectangular shapes and template matched with a template of the left and right edges of the cards. Pass 2 extracts the suit and rank of the cards by matching the top left portion of the card that contains both rank and suit information, with stored templates of ranks and suits of the playing cards using a series of if-then statements.

Wavelet analysis of stellar rotation and other periodicities (D. B. de Freitas - 26 September, 2010)
We use the WaveLab--package (library of Matlab routines for wavelet analysis) for the decomposition and a modified version of Colorado--package for the wavelet maps of synthetic and observed light curve. From different applications, including Virgo/SoHO, NSO/Kitt Peak, Voyager 1 and Sunspot data and synthetic light curve produced by different simulators, we show that this technique is a solid procedure to extract the stellar rotation period and possible variations due to active regions evolution. In this paper we show the Morlet Wavelet Amplitude Maps, respectively corresponding to oscillations in the photospheric magnetic field of the Sun (NSO/Kitt Peak data), the daily averages of the magnetic field strength B versus time measured by Voyager 1 (V1) during 1978, and synthetic light curve produced by A

Segmentation of Alzheimers Disease in PET scan datasets using MATLAB (A. Meena - 26 February, 2013)
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan images are one of the bio medical imaging techniques similar to that of MRI scan images but PET scan images are helpful in finding the development of tumors.The PET scan images requires expertise in the segmentation where clustering plays an important role in the automation process.The segmentation of such images is manual to automate the process clustering is used.Clustering is commonly known as unsupervised learning process of n dimensional data sets are clustered into k groups so as to maximize the inter cluster similarity and to minimize the intra cluster similarity.This paper is proposed to implement the commonly used K Means and Fuzzy CMeans (FCM) clustering algorithm.This work is implemented using MATrix LABoratory (MATLAB) and tested with sample PET scan image
