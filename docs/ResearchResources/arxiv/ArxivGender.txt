Gendered behavior as a disadvantage in open source software development (Balazs Vedres - 6 October, 2018)
We test differences in success and survival along both categorical gender and the gendered pattern of behavior. We find that 84.5% of women's disadvantage (compared to men) in success and 34.8% of their disadvantage in survival are due to the female pattern of their behavior

Automated Test Generation to Detect Individual Discrimination in AI Models (Aniya Agarwal - 10 September, 2018)
Such a discrimination exists when two individuals who differ only in the values of their protected attributes (such as, gender/race) while the values of their non-protected ones are exactly the same, get different decisions. Our experimental results clearly demonstrate that our technique produces 3.72 times more successful test cases than the existing state-of-the-art across all our chosen benchmarks.

Using models trained on data from 284,335 patients, and validated on two independent datasets of 12,026 and 999 patients, we predict cardiovascular risk factors not previously thought to be present or quantifiable in retinal images, such as such as age (within 3.26 years), gender (0.97 AUC), smoking status (0.71 AUC), HbA1c (within 1.39%), systolic blood pressure (within 11.23mmHg) as well as major adverse cardiac events (0.70 AUC)

For example, the activity cooking is over 33% more likely to involve females than males in a training set, and a trained model further amplifies the disparity to 68% at test time. Our method results in almost no performance loss for the underlying recognition task but decreases the magnitude of bias amplification by 47.5% and 40.5% for multilabel classification and visual semantic role labeling, respectively.

Local Deep Neural Networks for Age and Gender Classification (Zukang Liao - 24 March, 2017)
Local deep neural networks have been recently introduced for gender recognition. Instead of using hundreds of patches per image, as suggested by the original method, we propose to use 9 overlapping patches per image which cover the entire face region. This results in a much reduced training time, since just 9 patches are extracted per image instead of hundreds, at the expense of a slightly reduced performance. For both tasks and both databases the performance is up to 1% lower compared to the original version of the algorithm

Using Deep Learning and Google Street View to Estimate the Demographic Makeup of the US (Timnit Gebru - 2 March, 2017)
The United States spends more than $1B each year on initiatives such as the American Community Survey (ACS), a labor-intensive door-to-door study that measures statistics relating to race, gender, education, occupation, unemployment, and other demographic factors. Here, we present a method that determines socioeconomic trends from 50 million images of street scenes, gathered in 200 American cities by Google Street View cars. Data from this census of motor vehicles, which enumerated 22M automobiles in total (8% of all automobiles in the US), was used to accurately estimate income, race, education, and voting patterns, with single-precinct resolution. (The average US precinct contains approximately 1000 people.) The resulting associations are surprisingly simple and powerful. For instance, if the number of sedans encountered during a 15-minute drive through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely to vote for a Democrat during the next Presidential election (88% chance); otherwise, it is likely to vote Republican (82%)

The method was able to provide the following demographic, preferential, and topological results about the test bed: (1) There are more female users (52.34\%) than male (47.66\%); (2) Homophily (i.e., birds-of-a-feather adage) is observed in the preferences of users with respect to age levels, such that they are strongly biased towards being friends with users of a similar age; (3) There is heterophily in gender preference such that friendship among users of the opposite gender occurs more often. (4) It exhibits a small-world characteristic with an average path length of 4.5 (maximum=12) among connected users, shorter than the well-known {\em six degrees of separation}~\cite{travers69}; And (5) The network exhibits a scale-free characteristics with heavily-tailed power-law distribution (with the power $Î»= -1.02$ and $R^2 = 0.84$) suggesting the presence of many users acting as the network hubs

Inferring User Preferences by Probabilistic Logical Reasoning over Social Networks (Jiwei Li - 10 November, 2014)
Our method answers questions about Twitter users like {\em Does this user like sushi?} or {\em Is this user a New York Knicks fan?} by building a probabilistic model that reasons over user attributes (the user's location or gender) and the social network (the user's friends and spouse), via inferences like homophily (I am more likely to like sushi if spouse or friends like sushi, I am more likely to like the Knicks if I live in New York). Our experiments show that probabilistic logical reasoning significantly improves the performance on attribute and relation extraction, and also achieves an F-score of 0.791 at predicting a users likes or dislikes, significantly better than two strong baselines.

Our results suggest that the gender-from-iris problem is more difficult than has so far been appreciated. Estimating accuracy using a mean of N person-disjoint train and test partitions, and considering the effect of makeup - a combination of experimental conditions not present in any previous work - we find a much weaker ability to predict gender-from-iris texture than has been suggested in previous work.

Joint Gender Classification and Age Estimation by Nearly Orthogonalizing Their Semantic Spaces (Qing Tian - 13 September, 2016)

In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we exemplify it by respectively taking the widely used binary-class SVM for gender classification, and two threshold-based ordinal regression methods (i.e., the discriminant learning for ordinal regression and support vector ordinal regression) for age estimation, and crucially coupling both through the proposed semantic formulation
