TipsC: Tips and Corrections for programming MOOCs (Saksham Sharma - 1 April, 2018)
We evaluated the effectiveness of TipsC's clustering algorithm on data collected from previous offerings of an introductory programming course conducted at IIT Kanpur where the grades were given by human TAs. The results show the weighted average variance of marks for clusters when similar submissions are grouped together is 47% less compared to the case when all programs are grouped together.

The Heun operator as a Hamiltonian (Alexander V. Turbiner - 14 May, 2016)
IIt is shown that the celebrated Heun operator $H_e=-(a_0 x^3 + a_1 x^2 + a_2 x) \frac{d^2}{dx^2} + (b_0 x^2 + b_1 x + b_2)\frac{d}{dx} + c_0 x$ is the Hamiltonian of the $sl(2,R)$-quantum Euler-Arnold top of spin $Î½$ in a constant magnetic field. For $a_0 \neq 0$ it is canonically-equivalent to $BC_1(A_1)-$ Calogero-Moser-Sutherland quantum models, if $a_0=0$, ten known one-dimensional quasi-exactly-solvable problems are reproduced, and if, in addition, $b_0=c_0=0$, then four well-known one-dimensional quantal exactly-solvable problems are reproduced

Measuring integrated information from the decoding perspective (Masafumi Oizumi - 17 May, 2015)
IIT predicts that the amount of integrated information in the brain should reflect levels of consciousness. Measures of integrated information should satisfy the lower and upper bounds as follows: The lower bound of integrated information should be 0 when the system does not generate information (no information) or when the system comprises independent parts (no integration). The upper bound of integrated information is the amount of information generated by the whole system and is realized when the amount of information generated independently by its parts equals to 0

The Abundance of X-Shaped Radio Sources: Implications for the Gravitational Wave Background (David H. Roberts - 25 August, 2015)
IIt was proposed by Merritt and Ekers (2002) that X-shaped radio galaxies are signposts of such coalescences, and that their abundance might be used to predict the magnitude of the gravitational wave background. (2015) we present radio images of all 52 X-shaped radio source candidates out of the sample of 100 selected by Cheung (2007) for which archival VLA data were available. These images indicate that at most 21% of the candidates might be genuine X-shaped radio sources that were formed by a restarting of beams in a new direction following a major merger. This suggests that fewer than 1.3% of extended radio sources appear to be candidates for genuine axis reorientations ("spin flips"), much smaller than the 7% suggested by Leahy and Parma (1992)

Network algorithmics and the emergence of information integration in cortical models (Andre Nathan - 27 December, 2010)
An information-theoretic framework known as integrated information theory (IIT) has been introduced recently for the study of the emergence of consciousness in the brain [D. 4, e1000091 (2008)]. E 81, 021916 (2010)] and, to allow for somewhat improved testability relative to IIT, adopts the well-known notions of information gain and total correlation applied to a set of variables representing the reachability of neurons by messages in the model's dynamics

Design, construction, and operation of SciFi tracking detector for K2K experiment (A. Suzuki - 27 April, 2000)
The detector uses 3.7 m long and 0.692 mm diameter scintillating fiber coupled to image-intensifier tubes (IIT), and a CCD camera readout system. Fiber sheet production and detector construction began in 1997, and the detector was commissioned in March, 1999. Results from the first K2K runs confirm good initial performance : position resolution is estimated to be about 0.8 mm, and track finding efficiency is $98 \pm 2$ % for long tracks (i.e., those which intersect more than 5 fiber planes). The hit efficiency was estimated to be $92 \pm 2$ % using cosmic-ray muons, after noise reduction at the offline stage

Measuring Integrated Information: Comparison of Candidate Measures in Theory and Simulation (Pedro A. M. Mediano - 25 June, 2018)
Integrated Information Theory (IIT) is a prominent theory of consciousness that has at its centre measures that quantify the extent to which a system generates more information than the sum of its parts. Our results help guide the operationalisation of IIT and advance the development of measures of integrated information that may have more general applicability.

Efficient Algorithms for Searching the Minimum Information Partition in Integrated Information Theory (Jun Kitazono - 13 February, 2018)
IIT proposes that to quantify information integration in a system as a whole, integrated information should be measured across the partition of the system at which information loss caused by partitioning is minimized, called the Minimum Information Partition (MIP). The computational cost for exhaustively searching for the MIP grows exponentially with system size, making it difficult to apply IIT to real neural data

Computing Integrated Information (Stephan Krohn - 3 March, 2017)
Integrated information theory (IIT) has established itself as one of the leading theories for the study of consciousness.

Moving Past the Minimum Information Partition: How To Quickly and Accurately Calculate Integrated Information (Daniel Toker - 3 May, 2016)

We show that integrated information can be reliably and quickly calculated across the Maximum Modularity Partition, as well as the previously proposed atomic partition, even in relatively large networks, which constitutes an advance in researchers' ability to empirically test the predictions of IIT in real brain data.
