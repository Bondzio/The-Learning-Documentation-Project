The Arches cluster out to its tidal radius: dynamical mass segregation and the effect of the extinction law on the stellar mass function (Maryam Habibi - 10 June, 2013)
We observed the Arches cluster out to its tidal radius using Ks-band imaging obtained with NAOS/CONICA at the VLT combined with Subaro/Cisco J-band data to gain a full understanding of the cluster mass distribution. Assuming the two regimes of widely used infrared extinction laws, we show that the difference can reach up to 30% for individually derived stellar masses and Delta AKs ~ 1 magnitude in acquired Ks-band extinction, while the present-day mass function slope changes by ~ 0.17 dex. The present-day mass function slope derived assuming the more recent extinction law increases from a flat slope of alpha_{Nishi}=-1.50 \pm0.35 in the core (r<0.2 pc) to alpha_{Nishi}=-2.21 \pm0.27 in the intermediate annulus (0.2 <r<0.4 pc), where the Salpeter slope is -2.3. The mass function steepens to alpha_{Nishi}=-3.21 \pm0.30 in the outer annulus (0.4<r<1.5 pc), indicating that the outer cluster region is depleted of high-mass stars

Broad Balmer-line Absorption in SDSS J172341.10+555340.5 (Kentaro Aoki - 3 August, 2010)
I present the discovery of Balmer-line absorption from H alpha to H9 in iron low-ionizaton broad absorption line (FeLoBAL) quasar, SDSS~J172341.10+555340.5 by near-infrared spectroscopy with the Cooled Infrared Spectrograph and Camera for OHS (CISCO) attached to the Subaru telescope. The redshift of the Balmer-line absorption troughs is 2.0530 +/- 0.0003, and it is blueshifted by 5370 km s^{-1} from the Balmer emission lines. It is more than $4000$ km s^{-1} blueshifted from the previously known UV absorption lines. I derived a column density of neutral hydrogen of 5.2x10^{17} cm^{-2} by using the curve of growth and taking account of Ly alpha trapping

When galaxies collide: understanding the broad absorption-line radio galaxy 4C +72.26 (D. J. B. Smith - 12 January, 2010)

Discovery of H alpha absorption in the unusual broad absorption line quasar SDSS J083942.11+380526.3 (Kentaro Aoki - 3 July, 2006)
We discovered an H alpha absorption in a broad H alpha emission line of an unusual broad absorption line quasar, SDSS J083942.11+380526.3 at z=2.318, by near-infrared spectroscopy with the Cooled Infrared Spectrograph and Camera for OHS (CISCO) on the Subaru telescope. The Presence of non-stellar H alpha absorption is known only in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 4151 to date, thus our discovery is the first case for quasars. The H alpha absorption line is blueshifted by 520 km/s relative to the H alpha emission line, and its redshift almost coincides with those of UV low-ionization metal absorption lines. The width of the H alpha absorption (~ 340 km/s) is similar to those of the UV low-ionization absorption lines. The continuum spectrum is reproduced by a reddened (E(B-V) ~ 0.15 mag for the SMC-like reddening law) composite quasar spectrum. Furthermore, the UV spectrum of SDSS J083942.11+380526.3 shows a remarkable similarity to that of NGC 4151 in its low state, suggesting the physical condition of the absorber in SDSS J083942.11+380526.3 is similar to that of NGC 4151 in the low state. As proposed for NGC 4151, SDSS J083942.11+380526.3 may be also seen through the close direction of the surface of the obscuring torus.

Proto-Clusters with Evolved Populations around Radio Galaxies at z~2.5 (Masaru Kajisawa - 16 June, 2006)
We report a discovery of proto-cluster candidates around high redshift radio galaxies at z~2.5 on the basis of clear statistical excess of colour-selected galaxies around them seen in the deep near-infrared imaging data obtained with CISCO on Subaru Telescope. We have observed six targets, all at similar redshifts at z~2.5, and our data reach to J=23.5, H=22.6 and K=21.8 (5 sigma) and cover a 1.6' x 1.6' field centered on each radio galaxy. We apply colour cuts in JHKs in order to exclusively search for galaxies located at high redshifts, z>2. Over the magnitude range of 19.5<K<21.5 we see a significant excess of red galaxies with J-K>2.3 by a factor of two around the combined radio galaxies fields compared to those found in the general field of GOODS South. The excess of galaxies around the radio galaxies fields becomes more than factor of three around 19.5<K<20.5 when the two-colours cuts are applied with JHKs

Vigorous star formation in a bulge-dominated ERO at z = 1.34 (Garret Cotter - 1 April, 2005)
We present near-IR spectroscopy of three Extremely Red Objects (EROs) using the OHS/CISCO spectrograph at Subaru telescope. One target exhibits a strong emission line which we identify as H-alpha at z = 1.34. Using new and existing ground-based optical and near-IR imaging, and archival HST imaging, we argue that this target is essentially an elliptical galaxy, with an old stellar population of around 4E11 solar masses, but having a dust-enshrouded star-forming component with a SFR of some 50--100 solar masses per yr. Analysis of a further two targets, which do not exhibit any features in our near-IR spectra, suggests that one is a quiescent galaxy in the redshift range 1.2 < z < 1.6, but that the other cannot be conclusively categorised as either star-forming or quiescent.

Multiwavelength Properties of the X-ray Sources in the Groth-Westphal Strip Field (Takamitsu Miyaji - 25 February, 2004)
We have made near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic observations using the Subaru OHS/CISCO spectrometer for five of the X-ray sources for which we found no indication of an AGN activity in the optical spectrum. Nineteen sources have been detected in the Ks band and four of these are extremely red objects (I814-Ks>4). Assuming that the known local relations among the bulge luminosity,central velocity dispersion, and the mass of the central blackhole hold at about z=1, the AGN bolometric luminosity to Eddington luminosity ratio ranges from 0.3% to 10%

A Slow Merger History of Field Galaxies Since z~1 (Kevin Bundy - 8 December, 2003)
Using deep infrared observations conducted with the CISCO imager on the Subaru Telescope, we investigate the field-corrected pair fraction and the implied merger rate of galaxies in redshift survey fields with Hubble Space Telescope imaging. In the redshift interval, 0.5 < z < 1.5, the fraction of infrared-selected pairs increases only modestly with redshift to 7% +- 6% at z~1. This is nearly a factor of three less than the fraction, 22% +- 8%, determined using the same technique on HST optical images and as measured in a previous similar study. At z~1, we estimate this to be 2x10^{9 +- 0.2} solar masses per galaxy per Gyr

A Redshift z = 6.56 Galaxy Behind the Cluster Abell 370 (Esther M. Hu - 6 March, 2002)

From the detailed lensing model of this cluster, we estimate a lensing amplification of 4.5 for this galaxy, which is located slightly over an arcminute from the center of the cluster, for an unlensed flux of 6.5 x 10^-18 erg cm^-2 s^-1

OHS: OH-airglow Suppressor for the Subaru Telescope (F. Iwamuro - 22 February, 2001)
Specifically, it is a pre-optics system installed between the telescope and an infrared camera/spectrograph (CISCO). The suppressor reduces sky background emissions to 1/25 and its throughput is 40%. As a result, the S/N gain achieved with OHS is more than 1 mag compared to the typical spectroscopic approach. The limiting magnitude measured during a test observing run was found to be $H$ = 21.1 mag ($Î»/ÎÎ»$ = 210, S/N = 5) in the standard 4000 s exposure sequence.

[OII]3727 Emission from the Companion to the Quasar BR 1202-0725 at z=4.7 (K. Ohta - 8 March, 2000)
Results of a narrow-band imaging for the redshifted [OII]3727 emission around a quasar at z=4.7 obtained with the Subaru telescope and CISCO (a Cassegrain near infrared camera) are presented. A significant emission line is detected in the narrow-band H_2 (v=1-0 S(1)) filter at a location 2.4" northwest from the quasar, where the presence of a companion has been reported in Lyman alpha emission and the rest-frame UV continuum. We identify this line as [OII]3727 emission and confirm that the source really is a companion at z=4.7. The [OII]3727 flux from the companion is estimated to be 2.5 x 10^{-17} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}. If the companion is a star forming object, the inferred star formation rate is as high as 45-230 M_{solar} yr^{-1} even without assuming the extinction correction. Thus, provided that the difference is caused by dust extinction, the extinction corrected star formation rate is calculated to be 45 to 2300 M_{solar} yr^{-1} depending on the assuming extinction curves.

Infrared Imaging of the Gravitational Lens PG 1115+080 with the Subaru Telescope (F. Iwamuro - 5 January, 2000)
We present high spatial resolution images of the gravitational-lens system PG 1115+080 taken with the near-infrared camera (CISCO) on the Subaru telescope. The FWHM of the combined image is $0.''32$ in the $K'$-band, yielding spatial resolution of $0.''14$ after a deconvolution procedure. This is a first detection of an extended emission adjacent to the A1/A2 components, indicating the presence of a fairly bright emission region with a characteristic angular radius of $\sim$ 5 mas (40 pc). The $J-K'$ color is found to be significantly redder than that of a synthetic model galaxy with an age of 3 Gyr, the age of the universe at the quasar redshift.
