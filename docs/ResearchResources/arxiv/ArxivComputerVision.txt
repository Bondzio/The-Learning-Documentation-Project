Learning Visual Features from Large Weakly Supervised Data (Armand Joulin - 6 November, 2015)
Convolutional networks trained on large supervised dataset produce visual features which form the basis for the state-of-the-art in many computer-vision problems. We train convolutional networks on a dataset of 100 million Flickr photos and captions, and show that these networks produce features that perform well in a range of vision problems

Virtual Worlds as Proxy for Multi-Object Tracking Analysis (Adrien Gaidon - 20 May, 2016)
We propose an efficient real-to-virtual world cloning method, and validate our approach by building and publicly releasing a new video dataset, called Virtual KITTI (see http://www.xrce.xerox.com/Research-Development/Computer-Vision/Proxy-Virtual-Worlds), automatically labeled with accurate ground truth for object detection, tracking, scene and instance segmentation, depth, and optical flow

Field geology with a wearable computer: 1st results of the Cyborg Astrobiologist System (Patrick C. McGuire - 24 June, 2005)
Overall, the hardware and software systems function reliably, and the computer-vision algorithms are adequate for the first field tests. Nonetheless, despite these and other technical inadequacies, this Cyborg Astrobiologist system, consisting of a camera-equipped wearable-computer and its computer-vision algorithms, has demonstrated its ability of finding genuinely interesting points in real-time in the geological scenery, and then gathering more information about these interest points in an automated manner
