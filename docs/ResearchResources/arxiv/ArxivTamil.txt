KS_JU@DPIL-FIRE2016:Detecting Paraphrases in Indian Languages Using Multinomial Logistic Regression Model (Kamal Sarkar - 24 December, 2016)
Out of 11 teams participated in the shared task, only four teams participated in all four languages, Hindi, Punjabi, Malayalam and Tamil, but the remaining 7 teams participated in one of the four languages. The overall average performance of our system including task1 and task2 overall four languages is F1-score of 0.81 which is the second highest score among the four systems that participated in all four languages.

Improving the Performance of Neural Machine Translation Involving Morphologically Rich Languages (Krupakar Hans - 8 January, 2017)
First, the use of Word2Vec embedding for both the English and Tamil words improved the translation results by 0.73 BLEU points over the baseline RNNSearch model with 4.84 BLEU score. The use of morphological segmentation before word vectorization to split the morphologically rich Tamil words into their respective morphemes before the translation, caused a reduction in the target vocabulary size by a factor of 8. Also, this model (RNNMorph) improved the performance of neural machine translation by 7.05 BLEU points over the RNNSearch model used over the same corpus

Part-of-Speech Tagging for Code-mixed Indian Social Media Text at ICON 2015 (Kamal Sarkar - 6 January, 2016)
We submitted runs for Bengali-English, Hindi-English and Tamil-English Language pairs. Our system has been trained and tested on the datasets released for ICON 2015 shared task: POS Tagging For Code-mixed Indian Social Media Text. In constrained mode, our system obtains average overall accuracy (averaged over all three language pairs) of 75.60% which is very close to other participating two systems (76.79% for IIITH and 75.79% for AMRITA_CEN) ranked higher than our system. In unconstrained mode, our system obtains average overall accuracy of 70.65% which is also close to the system (72.85% for AMRITA_CEN) which obtains the highest average overall accuracy.

Significance of the levels of spectral valleys with application to front/back distinction of vowel sounds (T. V. Ananthapadmanabha - 5 October, 2015)
Classification of vowels into front/back distinction with the difference (VI-VII) as an acoustic feature, tested using TIMIT, NTIMIT, Tamil and Kannada language databases gives, on the average, an accuracy of about 95%, which is comparable to the accuracy (90.6%) obtained using a neural network classifier trained and tested using MFCC as the feature vector for TIMIT database. The acoustic feature (VI-VII) has also been tested for its robustness on the TIMIT database for additive white and babble noise and an accuracy of about 95% has been obtained for SNRs down to 25 dB for both types of noise.

Comets in ancient India (Patrick Das Gupta - 30 November, 2014)
Could it have been inspired by the hirsute appearance of a comet's tail? Similarly, could `Ketu' (the torso or the tail part of Rahu) be a Dravidian loan word, since `kottu', an old Tamil word, is associated with scorpion's sting and top tuft of hair? Varahamihira in 550 AD and Ballal Sena ($\sim $ 1100 - 1200 AD) have described a large number of comets recorded by ancient seers such as Parashara, Vriddha Garga, Narada, Garga, etc

Fuzzy and Neutrosophic Analysis of Women with HIV/AIDS (W. B. Vasantha Kandasamy - 2 July, 2005)
The first chapter gives a brief introduction about HIV/AIDS among rural women in Tamil Nadu. Chapter 2 is an analysis of the situation using fuzzy theory in general and Fuzzy Relational Maps (FRM)in particular. In Chapter 3, we use Fuzzy Associative Memories (FAM) to analyze the problem because FAM is the only fuzzy tool that can give the gradations of each of the nodes/concepts. In Chapter 4 for the first time we use neutrosophic theory in general and neutrosophic relational maps (NRM) in particular to analyze this problem. The sixth chapter gives the translated version of the verbatim interviews of the 101 HIV/AIDS infected, rural, uneducated, and poor women of Tamil Nadu.
