Toward Automated Early Sepsis Alerting: Identifying Infection Patients from Nursing Notes (Emilia Apostolova - 11 September, 2018)
In this study, we developed a method for automatic monitoring of nursing notes for signs and symptoms of infection. The dataset was used to create a Machine Learning model that achieved an F1-score ranging from 79 to 96%.

Do females create higher impact research? Scopus citations and Mendeley readers for articles from five countries (Mike Thelwall - 9 August, 2018)
There are known gender imbalances in participation in scientific fields, from female dominance of nursing to male dominance of mathematics. Field normalised logged Scopus citations and Mendeley readers from mid-2018 for articles published in 2014 were investigated for articles with first authors from India, Spain, Turkey, the UK and the USA in up to 251 fields with at least 50 male and female authors. Although female-authored research is less cited in Turkey (-4.0%) and India (-3.6%), it is marginally more cited in Spain (0.4%), the UK (0.4%), and the USA (0.2%). Female-authored research has fewer Mendeley readers in India (-1.1%) but more in Spain (1.4%), Turkey (1.1%), the UK (2.7%) and the USA (3.0%)

Measuring Social Media Activity of Scientific Literature: An Exhaustive Comparison of Scopus and Novel Altmetrics Big Data (Saeed-Ul Hassan - 17 July, 2017)
Blog count appears to be the most important factor increasing the number of citations by 38.6% in the field of Health Professions and Nursing, followed by Twitter count increasing the number of citations by 8% in the field of Physics and Astronomy. While there was a positive weak correlation between bibliometric and altmetric indices, the results show that altmetric indices can be a good indicator to discriminate highly cited publications, with an encouragingly AUC= 0.725 between highly cited publications and total altmetric count

Recognizing Activities of Daily Living from Egocentric Images (Alejandro Cartas - 13 April, 2017)
Recognizing Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) has a large number of health applications, such as characterize lifestyle for habit improvement, nursing and rehabilitation services. The proposed method was tested on a subset of the NTCIR-12 egocentric dataset, consisting of 18,674 images and achieved an overall accuracy of 86% activity recognition on 21 classes.

Semi-Coupled Two-Stream Fusion ConvNets for Action Recognition at Extremely Low Resolutions (Jiawei Chen - 5 October, 2018)
Reliable action recognition using eLR cameras would address privacy concerns in various application environments such as private homes, hospitals, nursing/rehabilitation facilities, etc. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods at extremely low resolutions on IXMAS (93.7%) and HMDB (29.2%) datasets.

Partial matching face recognition method for rehabilitation nursing robots beds (Dongmei Liang - 2 August, 2015)
We propose a face recognition method based on partial matching Hu moments which apply for rehabilitation nursing robots beds. Experimental results show that this method can efficiently identify face in a dynamic video and it has high practical value (the accuracy rate is 91% and the average recognition time is 4.3s).

H Index of scientific Nursing journals according to Google Scholar Metrics (2007-2011) (Liliana Marcela Reina Leal - 16 July, 2013)
The aim of this report is to present a ranking of Nursing journals covered in Google Scholar Metrics (GSM), a Google product launched in 2012 to assess the impact of scientific journals from citation counts this receive on Google Scholar. Google has chosen to include only those journals that have published at least 100 papers and have at least one citation in a period of five years (2007-2011). Journal rankings are sorted by languages (showing the 100 papers with the greatest impact). In this case, it only shows the 20 journals with the highest h index

Ambient Assisted Living technologies from the perspectives of older people and professionals (Deepika Singh - 19 April, 2018)
Despite significant advancement in AAL technologies and smart systems, they have still not found the way into the nursing home of the older people. A qualitative study was performed at a nursing home to understand the needs and requirements of the residents and caregivers and their perspectives about the existing AAL technologies.

Paving the Way for Culturally Competent Robots: a Position Paper (Barbara Bruno - 22 March, 2018)
Cultural competence is a well known requirement for an effective healthcare, widely investigated in the nursing literature. Drawing inspiration from existing guidelines for culturally competent healthcare and the state-of-the-art in culturally competent robotics, we identify the key robot capabilities which enable culturally competent behaviours and discuss methodologies for their development and evaluation.

A Greedy Double Swap Heuristic for Nurse Scheduling (Murphy Choy - 10 May, 2012)
In addition, the preferences of the nursing staffs related to their work schedules add another dimension of complexity. However, the psychological needs of the nurses are ignored and this resulted in subsequent interventions by the nursing staffs to remedy any deficiency and often results in last minute changes to the schedule
