Residualized Factor Adaptation for Community Social Media Prediction Tasks (Mohammadzaman Zamani - 28 August, 2018)
We use eleven demographic and socioeconomic attributes, and evaluate our approach over five different community-level predictive tasks, spanning health (heart disease mortality, percent fair/poor health), psychology (life satisfaction), and economics (percent housing price increase, foreclosure rate). Our evaluation shows that residualized factor adaptation significantly improves 4 out of 5 community-level outcome predictions over prior state-of-the-art for incorporating socio-demographic contexts.

Optimal Algorithms for Continuous Non-monotone Submodular and DR-Submodular Maximization (Rad Niazadeh - 23 May, 2018)
This family of optimization problems has several applications in machine learning, economics, and communication systems. Our main result is the first $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm for continuous submodular function maximization; this approximation factor of $\frac{1}{2}$ is the best possible for algorithms that only query the objective function at polynomially many points. when the submodular functions is also coordinate wise concave along all coordinates, we provide a different $\frac{1}{2}$-approximation algorithm that runs in quasilinear time. Both of these results improve upon prior work [Bian et al, 2017, Soma and Yoshida, 2017].

Dancing Pigs or Externalities? Measuring the Rationality of Security Decisions (Elissa M. Redmiles - 16 May, 2018)
In this work, we conduct behavioral economics experiments to model the rationality of end-user security decision-making in a realistic online experimental system simulating a bank account. We find that more than 50% of our participants made rational (e.g., utility optimal) decisions, and we find that participants are more likely to behave rationally in the face of higher risk

Computer-aided mechanism design: designing revenue-optimal mechanisms via neural networks (Weiran Shen - 9 May, 2018)
Using AI approaches to automatically design mechanisms has been a central research mission at the interface of AI and economics [Conitzer and Sandholm, 2002]. Previous approaches that a empt to design revenue optimal auctions for the multi-dimensional settings fall short in at least one of the three aspects: 1) representation --- search in a space that probably does not even contain the optimal mechanism; 2) exactness --- finding a mechanism that is either not truthful or far from optimal; 3) domain dependence --- need a different design for different environment settings

Modeling and Analysis of Leaky Deception using Signaling Games with Evidence (Jeffrey Pawlick - 18 April, 2018)
Deception plays critical roles in economics and technology, especially in emerging interactions in cyberspace. We find that 1) high-quality detectors eliminate some pure-strategy equilibria, 2) detectors with high true-positive rates encourage more honest signaling than detectors with low false-positive rates, 3) receivers obtain optimal outcomes for equal-error-rate detectors, and 4) surprisingly, deceptive senders sometimes benefit from highly accurate deception detectors

Using Deep Learning for Title-Based Semantic Subject Indexing to Reach Competitive Performance to Full-Text (Florian Mai - 29 May, 2018)
We evaluate this question on a large-scale dataset from the medical domain (PubMed) and from economics (EconBiz). In these datasets, the titles and annotations of millions of publications are available, and they outnumber the available full-texts by a factor of 20 and 15, respectively. The best title-based classifier outperforms the best full-text method by 9.4%. On the PubMed dataset, the best title-based method almost reaches the performance of the best full-text classifier, with a difference of only 2.9%.

A New Classification of Technologies (Mario Coccia - 11 December, 2017)
This study here suggests a classification of technologies based on taxonomic characteristics of interaction between technologies in complex systems that is not a studied research field in economics of technical change. The proposed taxonomy here categorizes technologies in four typologies, in a broad analogy with the ecology: 1) technological parasitism is a relationship between two technologies T1 and T2 in a complex system S where one technology T1 benefits from the interaction with T2, whereas T2 has a negative side from interaction with T1; 2) technological commensalism is a relationship between two technologies in S where one technology benefits from the other without affecting it; 3) technological mutualism is a relationship in which each technology benefits from the activity of the other within complex systems; 4) technological symbiosis is a long-term interaction between two (or more) technologies that evolve together in complex systems

In addition, 78.2% of the detected IXPs in our data are based on multiple diverse evidence and therefore help have higher confidence on the detected IXPs than when relying solely on IXP prefixes

Recognising Multidimensional Euclidean Preferences (Dominik Peters - 25 February, 2016)

We show that, in contrast, for every other fixed dimension d > 1, the recognition problem is equivalent to the existential theory of the reals (ETR), and so in particular NP-hard. We further show that some Euclidean preference profiles require exponentially many bits in order to specify any Euclidean embedding, and prove that the domain of d-Euclidean preferences does not admit a finite forbidden minor characterisation for any d > 1

Ten-Year Cross-Disciplinary Comparison of the Growth of Open Access and How it Increases Research Citation Impact (C. Hajjem - 15 August, 2006)
We tested 1,307,038 articles published across 12 years (1992-2003) in 10 disciplines (Biology, Psychology, Sociology, Health, Political Science, Economics, Education, Law, Business, Management). A robot trawls the Web for full-texts using reference metadata ISI citation data (signal detectability d'=2.45; bias = 0.52). Percentage OA (relative to total OA + NOA) articles varies from 5%-16% (depending on discipline, year and country) and is slowly climbing annually (correlation r=.76, sample size N=12, probability p < 0.005). Comparing OA and NOA articles in the same journal/year, OA articles have consistently more citations, the advantage varying from 36%-172% by discipline and year. Comparing articles within six citation ranges (0, 1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15, 16+ citations), the annual percentage of OA articles is growing significantly faster than NOA within every citation range (r > .90, N=12, p < .0005) and the effect is greater with the more highly cited articles (r = .98, N=6, p < .005). Causality cannot be determined from these data, but our prior finding of a similar pattern in physics, where percent OA is much higher (and even approaches 100% in some subfields), makes it unlikely that the OA citation advantage is merely or mostly a self-selection bias (for making only one's better articles OA)
