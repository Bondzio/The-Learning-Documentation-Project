Collective emotion dynamics in chats with agents, moderators and Bots (M. Å uvakov - 18 November, 2014)
To design a realistic chat system, the interaction rules and some statistical parameters, as well as the agent's attributes, are inferred from the empirical chat channel \texttt{Ubuntu}. At $Îµ\gtrsim 0$, the collective emotional state matching the Bot's emotion polarity gradually arises; the average growth rate of the dominant emotional charge serves as an order parameter
