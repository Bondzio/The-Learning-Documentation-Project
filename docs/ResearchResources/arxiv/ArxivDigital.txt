Current digital therapeutic approaches for subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) such as the artificial pancreas and insulin bolus calculators leverage machine learning techniques for predicting subcutaneous glucose for improved control. In this work, we present a deep learning model that is capable of predicting glucose levels over a 30-minute horizon with leading accuracy for simulated patient cases (RMSE = 9.38$\pm$0.71 [mg/dL] and MARD = 5.50$\pm$0.62\%) and real patient cases (RMSE = 21.13$\pm$1.23 [mg/dL] and MARD = 10.08$\pm$0.83\%). In addition, the model also provides competitive performance in forecasting adverse glycaemic events with minimal time lag both in a simulated patient dataset (MCC$_{hyper}$ = 0.83$\pm$0.05 and MCC$_{hypo}$ = 0.80$\pm$0.10) and in a real patient dataset (MCC$_{hyper}$ = 0.79$\pm$0.04 and MCC$_{hypo}$ = 0.38$\pm$0.10).

Thus, any computational operation is conditionally reversible relative to any sufficiently-restrictive precondition on its initial state, and the minimum dissipation required for any deterministic operation by Landauer's Principle asymptotically approaches 0 when the probability of meeting any preselected one of its suitable preconditions approaches 1

Task Driven Generative Modeling for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation: Application to X-ray Image Segmentation (Yue Zhang - 11 June, 2018)
Specifically, a Dense Image-to-Image network (DI2I) for multi-organ segmentation is first trained on X-ray like Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) rendered from 3D CT volumes. In the numerical experiments, we validate the proposed model on 815 DRRs and 153 topograms. While the vanilla DI2I without any adaptation fails completely on segmenting the topograms, the proposed model does not require any topogram labels and is able to provide a promising average dice of 85% which achieves the same level accuracy of supervised training (88%).

An Ensemble of Transfer, Semi-supervised and Supervised Learning Methods for Pathological Heart Sound Classification (Ahmed Imtiaz Humayun - 7 October, 2018)
In this work, we propose an ensemble of classifiers to distinguish between various degrees of abnormalities of the heart using Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals acquired using digital stethoscopes in a clinical setting, for the INTERSPEECH 2018 Computational Paralinguistics (ComParE) Heart Beats SubChallenge. Our primary classification framework constitutes a convolutional neural network with 1D-CNN time-convolution (tConv) layers, which uses features transferred from a model trained on the 2016 Physionet Heart Sound Database. An ensemble of the three different approaches provides a relative improvement of 11.13% compared to our best single sub-system in terms of the Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) performance metric on the evaluation dataset.

Differential Evolution Algorithm Aided Turbo Channel Estimation and Multi-User Detection for G.Fast Systems in the Presence of FEXT (Jiankang Zhang - 15 June, 2018)
The ever-increasing demand for broadband Internet access has motivated the further development of the digital subscriber line to the G.fast standard in order to expand its operational band from 106 MHz to 212 MHz. In this paper, we propose a novel differential evolution algorithm (DEA) aided turbo channel estimation (CE) and multi-user detection (MUD) scheme for the G.fast upstream including the frequency band up to 212 MHz, which is capable of approaching the optimal Cramer-Rao lower bound of the channel estimate, whilst approaching the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) MUD's performance associated with perfect channel state information, and yet only imposing about 5% of its computational complexity. Our extensive simulations show that 18 dB normalized mean square error gain is attained by the channel estimator and 10 dB signal-to-noise ratio gain can be achieved by the MUD upon exploiting this iteration gain

RF-PUF: Enhancing IoT Security through Authentication of Wireless Nodes using In-situ Machine Learning (Baibhab Chatterjee - 18 June, 2018)
Traditional authentication in radio-frequency (RF) systems enable secure data communication within a network through techniques such as digital signatures and hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC), which suffer from key recovery attacks. State-of-the-art IoT networks such as Nest also use Open Authentication (OAuth 2.0) protocols that are vulnerable to cross-site-recovery forgery (CSRF), which shows that these techniques may not prevent an adversary from copying or modeling the secret IDs or encryption keys using invasive, side channel, learning or software attacks. Simulation results involving the process variations in a standard 65 nm technology node, and features such as LO offset and I-Q imbalance detected with a neural network having 50 neurons in the hidden layer indicate that the framework can distinguish up to 4800 transmitters with an accuracy of 99.9% (~ 99% for 10,000 transmitters) under varying channel conditions, and without the need for traditional preambles.

To evaluate the validity of our approach, we first develop a deep-CNN using 49 CEDM cases collected from Mayo Clinic to prove the contributions from recombined images for improved breast cancer diagnosis (0.86 in accuracy using LE imaging vs. 0.90 in accuracy using both LE and recombined imaging).

It is shown that in the massive MIMO limit, a reasonable choice for constellation range with one-bit precoding is that of the infinite-resolution precoding with per-symbol power constraint, but reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2/Ï}$ or about $0.8$. In term of number of antennas, one-bit precoding requires about 50% more antennas to achieve the same performance as infinite-resolution precoding.

Multi-User Frequency-Selective Hybrid MIMO Demonstrated Using 60 GHz RF Modules (Steve Blandino - 9 April, 2018)
As hardware limitations impede to realize a full digital architecture, hybrid MIMO architectures, using digital precoding and phased antenna arrays, are considered a feasible solution to implement multi-user MIMO at millimeter wave. In this paper, we present a 60 GHz MU-MIMO testbed using phased antenna arrays at both transmitter and receiver. The base station equipped with a 32 phased antenna array allocates simultaneously two users. In addition, we report an EVM constellation improvement of 6 dB when comparing the hybrid MIMO architecture with a fully analog architecture.

ZipNet-GAN: Inferring Fine-grained Mobile Traffic Patterns via a Generative Adversarial Neural Network (Chaoyun Zhang - 7 November, 2017)
Large-scale mobile traffic analytics is becoming essential to digital infrastructure provisioning, public transportation, events planning, and other domains. This enables to uniquely capture spatio-temporal relations between traffic volume snapshots routinely monitored over broad coverage areas (`low-resolution') and the corresponding consumption at 0.05 km $^2$ level (`high-resolution') usually obtained after intensive computation. Experiments we conduct with a real-world data set demonstrate that the proposed ZipNet(-GAN) infers traffic consumption with remarkable accuracy and up to 100$\times$ higher granularity as compared to standard probing, while outperforming existing data interpolation techniques

Results also confirm that performance gets severely degraded when the link length exceeds 90-100 meters and the transmit power falls below 0 dBW.

Narrowband Channel Estimation for Hybrid Beamforming Millimeter Wave Communication Systems with One-bit Quantization (Junmo Sung - 29 May, 2018)
Traditionally each antenna is paired with a high-speed analog-to-digital converter (ADC), which results in high power consumption. We show through simulation that 1) GAMP variants with one-bit ADCs have better performance than do least-squares estimation methods without quantization, 2) the proposed one-bit GAMP algorithm achieves the lowest estimation error among the GAMP variants, and 3) exploiting more frames and RF chains enhances the channel estimation performance.

Wideband Channel Estimation for Hybrid Beamforming Millimeter Wave Communication Systems with Low-Resolution ADCs (Junmo Sung - 29 October, 2017)
High power consumption due to a large number of antennas and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for beamforming to overcome the large propagation losses is problematic in practice. Through simulation, we show that 1) infinite bit ADCs with least-squares estimation have worse channel estimation performance than do one-bit ADCs with orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) in an SNR range of interest, 2) three- and four-bit quantizers can achieve channel estimation performance close to the unquantized case when using OMP, 3) a receiver with a single RF chain can yield better estimates than that with four RF chains if enough frames are exploited, and 4) for one-bit ADCs, exploitation of higher transmit power and more frames for performance enhancement adversely affects estimation performance after a certain point.

The circuit-level implementation of the MS-N in 65 nm CMOS technology exhibits 2-3 orders of magnitude better energy-efficiency over Dig-N for neuromorphic computing applications - especially at low frequencies due to the high leakage currents from many transistors in Dig-N. A system-level analysis using a cohesive circuit-algorithmic framework on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate an increase of 3% in worst-case classification error for MNIST when the integrated noise power in the bandwidth is ~ 1 Î¼V2.

Tolerating Soft Errors in Processor Cores Using CLEAR (Cross-Layer Exploration for Architecting Resilience) (Eric Cheng - 28 September, 2017)
We present CLEAR (Cross-Layer Exploration for Architecting Resilience), a first of its kind framework which overcomes a major challenge in the design of digital systems that are resilient to reliability failures: achieve desired resilience targets at minimal costs (energy, power, execution time, area) by combining resilience techniques across various layers of the system stack (circuit, logic, architecture, software, algorithm). Our framework automatically and systematically explores the large space of comprehensive resilience techniques and their combinations across various layers of the system stack (586 cross-layer combinations in this paper), derives cost-effective solutions that achieve resilience targets at minimal costs, and provides guidelines for the design of new resilience techniques. For example, a 50x improvement in silent data corruption rate is achieved at only 2.1% energy cost for an out-of-order core (6.1% for an in-order core) with no speed impact. However, (application-aware) selective circuit-level hardening alone, guided by a thorough analysis of the effects of soft errors on application benchmarks, provides a cost-effective soft error resilience solution as well (with ~1% additional energy cost for a 50x improvement in silent data corruption rate).

Resolution-Adaptive Hybrid MIMO Architectures for Millimeter Wave Communications (Jinseok Choi - 15 August, 2017)
In this paper, we propose a hybrid analog-digital beamforming architecture with resolution-adaptive ADCs for millimeter wave (mmWave) receivers with large antenna arrays. Contributions of this paper include 1) ADC bit-allocation algorithms to improve communication performance of a hybrid MIMO receiver, 2) approximation of the capacity with the BA algorithm as a function of channels, and 3) a worst-case analysis of the ergodic rate of the proposed MIMO receiver that quantifies system tradeoffs and serves as the lower bound. For a power constraint equivalent to that of fixed 4-bit ADCs, the revised BA algorithm makes the quantization error negligible while achieving 22% better energy efficiency. Having negligible quantization error allows existing state-of-the-art digital beamformers to be readily applied to the proposed system.

(The average US precinct contains approximately 1000 people.) The resulting associations are surprisingly simple and powerful. For instance, if the number of sedans encountered during a 15-minute drive through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely to vote for a Democrat during the next Presidential election (88% chance); otherwise, it is likely to vote Republican (82%)

When input frequency is 10.4MHz, it achieved an SNDR 45.9dB, SFDR 50dB, and an ENOB of 7.33 bit.

Finally, we model the in-app purchasing behavior in multiple steps: 1) we model the time between purchases; 2) we train a classifier to predict whether the user will make a purchase from a new app or continue purchasing from the existing app; and 3) based on the outcome of the previous step, we attempt to predict the exact app, new or existing, from which the next purchase will come

In this paper, we investigate the problem of downlink precoding for a narrowband massive MU-MIMO system with low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) at the base station (BS). Our results reveal that the performance attainable with infinite-resolution DACs can be approached using DACs having only 3 to 4 bits of resolution, depending on the number of BS antennas and the number of user equipments (UEs). Specifically, we show that nonlinear precoding incurs only a 3 dB penalty compared to the infinite-resolution case for an uncoded bit error rate of 10^-3, in a system with 128 BS antennas that uses 1-bit DACs and serves 16 single-antenna UEs. In contrast, the penalty for linear precoders is about 8 dB.

Using a generalizable stain normalization technique and the Proscia Pathology Cloud computing platform, we trained a deep convolutional neural network on millions of tissue and tumor image tiles to perform slide-based evaluation on our testing set of whole-slide images images, with a sensitivity of 0.96, specificity of 0.89, and AUC score of 0.90

What Happens After You Both Swipe Right: A Statistical Description of Mobile Dating Communications (Jennie Zhang - 12 July, 2016)
Furthermore, mobile dating has paved the way for analysis of these digital interactions via massive sets of data generated by the instant matching and messaging functions of its many platforms at an unprecedented scale. This paper looks at one of these sets of data: metadata of approximately two million conversations, containing 19 million messages, exchanged between 400,000 heterosexual users on an MDA. For instance, we report that men initiate 79% of conversations--and while about half of the initial messages are responded to, conversations initiated by men are more likely to be reciprocated. That said, the majority of reciprocated conversations lead to a phone number exchange within the first 20 messages.

In this paper, we proposed to find $n$ optimal projections, whereas $n\!<\!180$, in order to increase the expressiveness of Radon barcodes. We show examples for the exhaustive search for the simple case when we attempt to find 4 best projections out of 16 equidistant projections and compare it with the evolutionary approach in order to establish the benefit of the latter when operating on a small population size as in the case of micro-DE. We randomly selected 10 different classes from IRMA dataset (14,400 x-ray images in 58 classes) and further randomly selected 5 images per class for our tests.

CLEAR: Cross-Layer Exploration for Architecting Resilience - Combining Hardware and Software Techniques to Tolerate Soft Errors in Processor Cores (Eric Cheng - 23 June, 2016)
We present a first of its kind framework which overcomes a major challenge in the design of digital systems that are resilient to reliability failures: achieve desired resilience targets at minimal costs (energy, power, execution time, area) by combining resilience techniques across various layers of the system stack (circuit, logic, architecture, software, algorithm). Our framework automatically and systematically explores the large space of comprehensive resilience techniques and their combinations across various layers of the system stack (586 cross-layer combinations in this paper), derives cost-effective solutions that achieve resilience targets at minimal costs, and provides guidelines for the design of new resilience techniques. For example, a 50x improvement in silent data corruption rate is achieved at only 2.1% energy cost for an out-of-order core (6.1% for an in-order core) with no speed impact. However, selective circuit-level hardening alone, guided by a thorough analysis of the effects of soft errors on application benchmarks, provides a cost-effective soft error resilience solution as well (with ~1% additional energy cost for a 50x improvement in silent data corruption rate).

Conversion of Artificial Recurrent Neural Networks to Spiking Neural Networks for Low-power Neuromorphic Hardware (Peter U. Diehl - 16 January, 2016)
We demonstrate our approach by mapping a natural language processing task (question classification), where we demonstrate the entire mapping process of the recurrent layer of the network on IBM's Neurosynaptic System "TrueNorth", a spike-based digital neuromorphic hardware architecture. To satisfy these constraints, it was necessary to discretize the synaptic weights and neural activities to 16 levels, and to limit fan-in to 64 inputs. The hardware-constrained model achieved 74% accuracy in question classification while using less than 0.025% of the cores on one TrueNorth chip, resulting in an estimated power consumption of ~17 uW.

Asymptotic Performance Analysis for 1-bit Bayesian Smoothing (Lin Zhang - 17 November, 2015)
Using analog-to-digital converters (ADC) with $1$-bit amplitude resolution has been identified as a possible option in order to obtain low power consumption. The $1$-bit performance loss, in comparison to an ideal receiver with $\infty$-bit ADC, is well-established and moderate for low SNR applications ($2/Ï$ or $-1.96$ dB). Recently it has been shown that for parameter estimation with state-space models the $1$-bit performance loss with Bayesian filtering can be significantly smaller ($\sqrt{2/Ï}$ or $-0.98$ dB). Our results show that a $1$-bit receiver performing smoothing is able to outperform an ideal $\infty$-bit system carrying out filtering by the cost of an additional processing delay $Î$.

Codes with the Identifiable Parent Property for Multimedia Fingerprinting (Minquan Cheng - 25 November, 2014)

We first derive a general upper bound on the size $M$ of a multimedia $t$-IPP code, and then investigate multimedia $3$-IPP codes in more detail. We characterize a multimedia $3$-IPP code of length $2$ in terms of a bipartite graph and a generalized packing, respectively. By means of these combinatorial characterizations, we further derive a tight upper bound on the size of a multimedia $3$-IPP code of length $2$, and construct several infinite families of (asymptotically) optimal multimedia $3$-IPP codes of length $2$.

Double Counting in $2^t$-ary RSA Precomputation Reveals the Secret Exponent (Masahiro Kaminaga - 28 July, 2014)
A new fault attack, double counting attack (DCA), on the precomputation of $2^t$-ary modular exponentiation for a classical RSA digital signature (i.e., RSA without the Chinese remainder theorem) is proposed. DCA can reconstruct an entire secret exponent using the position checker with $63(=2^6-1)$ faulted signatures in a short time for a 1536-bit RSA implementation using the $2^6$-ary method. The DCA process can be accelerated for a small public exponent (e.g., 65537)

Analogue-digital systems and the modular decomposition of physical behaviour (E. J. Beggs - 16 April, 2018)
We model a general analogue-digital system as a physical process controlled by an algorithm by viewing the physical process as physical oracle to the algorithm, generalising the notion of Turing. We address the questions: How do we specify algorithms and software that monitor or govern a complex physical situation with many physical modes? How do we specify a portfolio of modes, and the computational problem of transitioning from using one mode to another mode as physical behaviour changes? We propose a general definition of an analogue-digital system with modes, and show how any diverse set of modes, with or without models, can be bound together, and how the transitions between modes can be determined, by constructing a data type and mode selection functions

Topological Tracking of Connected Components in Image Sequences (Rocio Gonzalez-Diaz - 3 January, 2018)
In this paper, taking as input a time-varying sequence of two-dimensional (2D) binary digital images, we develop an algorithm for encoding, in the so-called {\it spatiotemporal barcode}, lifetime of connected components (of either the foreground or background) that are moving in the image sequence over time (this information may not coincide with the one provided by the persistence barcode). The main contribution of this paper with respect to our previous works lies in a new algorithm that computes spatiotemporal paths directly, valid for both foreground and background and developed in a general context, setting the ground for a future extension for tracking higher dimensional topological features in $nD$ binary digital image sequences.
