Current digital therapeutic approaches for subjects with Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) such as the artificial pancreas and insulin bolus calculators leverage machine learning techniques for predicting subcutaneous glucose for improved control. In this work, we present a deep learning model that is capable of predicting glucose levels over a 30-minute horizon with leading accuracy for simulated patient cases (RMSE = 9.38$\pm$0.71 [mg/dL] and MARD = 5.50$\pm$0.62\%) and real patient cases (RMSE = 21.13$\pm$1.23 [mg/dL] and MARD = 10.08$\pm$0.83\%). In addition, the model also provides competitive performance in forecasting adverse glycaemic events with minimal time lag both in a simulated patient dataset (MCC$_{hyper}$ = 0.83$\pm$0.05 and MCC$_{hypo}$ = 0.80$\pm$0.10) and in a real patient dataset (MCC$_{hyper}$ = 0.79$\pm$0.04 and MCC$_{hypo}$ = 0.38$\pm$0.10). This approach is evaluated on a dataset of 10 simulated cases generated from the UVa/Padova simulator and a clinical dataset of 5 real cases each containing glucose readings, insulin bolus, and meal (carbohydrate) data. The prediction algorithm is implemented on an Android mobile phone, with an execution time of $6$ms on a phone compared to an execution time of $780$ms on a laptop in Python.

However, carefully examining its detailed formulation reveals that the traditional identification of logically reversible computational operations with bijective transformations of the full digital state space is actually not the correct logical-level characterization of the full set of classical computational operations that can be carried out physically with asymptotically zero energy dissipation. Thus, any computational operation is conditionally reversible relative to any sufficiently-restrictive precondition on its initial state, and the minimum dissipation required for any deterministic operation by Landauer's Principle asymptotically approaches 0 when the probability of meeting any preselected one of its suitable preconditions approaches 1

Task Driven Generative Modeling for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation: Application to X-ray Image Segmentation (Yue Zhang - 11 June, 2018)
Specifically, a Dense Image-to-Image network (DI2I) for multi-organ segmentation is first trained on X-ray like Digitally Reconstructed Radiographs (DRRs) rendered from 3D CT volumes. In the numerical experiments, we validate the proposed model on 815 DRRs and 153 topograms. While the vanilla DI2I without any adaptation fails completely on segmenting the topograms, the proposed model does not require any topogram labels and is able to provide a promising average dice of 85% which achieves the same level accuracy of supervised training (88%).
