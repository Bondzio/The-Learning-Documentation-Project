A Fast, Compact, Accurate Model for Language Identification of Codemixed Text (Yuan Zhang - 9 October, 2018)
Such text is prevalent online, in documents, social media, and message boards. We show that a feed-forward network with a simple globally constrained decoder can accurately and rapidly label both codemixed and monolingual text in 100 languages and 100 language pairs. This model outperforms previously published multilingual approaches in terms of both accuracy and speed, yielding an 800x speed-up and a 19.5% averaged absolute gain on three codemixed datasets

The 30-Year Cycle In The AI Debate (Jean-Marie Chauvet - 8 October, 2018)
Confronting squarely this media coverage, several analysts are starting to voice concerns about over-interpretation of AI's blazing successes and the sometimes poor public reporting on the topic. This paper reviews briefly the track-record in AI and Machine Learning and finds this pattern of early dramatic successes, followed by philosophical critique and unexpected difficulties, if not downright stagnation, returning almost to the clock in 30-year cycles since 1958.

This work examines the individuals on social media that are posting questionable health-related information, and in particular promoting cancer treatments which have been shown to be ineffective (making it a kind of misinformation, willful or not). Using a multi-stage user selection process, we study 4,212 Twitter users who have posted about one of 139 such "treatments", and compare them to a baseline of users generally interested in cancer. Considering features capturing user attributes, writing style, and sentiment, we build a classifier which is able to identify users prone to propagate such misinformation at an accuracy of over 90%, providing a potential tool for public health officials to identify such individuals for preventive intervention.

How To Extract Fashion Trends From Social Media? A Robust Object Detector With Support For Unsupervised Learning (Vijay Gabale - 28 June, 2018)
Moreover, state-of-the-art object detectors do not have any functionality to ingest large amount of unlabeled data available on social media in order to fine tune object detectors with labeled datasets. In this work, we show application of a generic object detector, that can be pretrained in an unsupervised manner, on 24 categories from recently released Open Images V4 dataset. We first train the base architecture of the object detector using unsupervisd learning on 60K unlabeled photos from 24 categories gathered from social media, and then subsequently fine tune it on 8.2K labeled photos from Open Images V4 dataset. On 300 X 300 image inputs, we achieve 72.7% mAP on a test dataset of 2.4K photos while performing 11% to 17% better as compared to the state-of-the-art object detectors

Segmentation of Arterial Walls in Intravascular Ultrasound Cross-Sectional Images Using Extremal Region Selection (Mehdi Faraji - 10 June, 2018)
Firstly, we investigate the feasibility of using a recently proposed region detector, namely Extremal Region of Extremum Level (EREL) to delineate the luminal and media-adventitia borders in IVUS frames acquired by 20 MHz probes. We extensively evaluated our selection strategy on the test set of a standard publicly available dataset containing 326 IVUS B-mode images. We showed that in the best case, the average Hausdorff Distances (HD) between the extracted ERELs and the actual lumen and media were $0.22$ mm and $0.45$ mm, respectively. The results of our experiments revealed that our selection strategy was able to segment the lumen with $\le 0.3$ mm HD to the gold standard even though the images contained major artifacts such as bifurcations, shadows, and side branches. Moreover, when there was no artifact, our proposed method was able to delineate media-adventitia boundaries with $0.31$ mm HD to the gold standard. Based on the results of this work, by using a 20 MHz IVUS probe with controlled pullback, not only can we now analyze the internal structure of human arteries more accurately, but also segment each frame during the pullback procedure because of the low run time of our proposed segmentation method.

But regardless of mechanism, the cascades in our analysis all have a similar reproduction number ($\approx$ 1.8), meaning that lower rates of exposure can be offset with higher per-exposure rates of adoption

These producers use many different strategies to get their message believed by readers through the writing styles they employ, by repetition across different media sources with or without attribution, as well as other mechanisms that are yet to be studied deeply. To better facilitate systematic studies in this area, we present a large political news data set, containing over 136K news articles, from 92 news sources, collected over 7 months of 2017. In addition to each article we compute 130 content-based and social media engagement features drawn from a wide range of literature on political bias, persuasion, and misinformation. In this paper, we discuss the first release of the data set and demonstrate 4 use cases of the data and features: news characterization, engagement characterization, news attribution and content copying, and discovering news narratives.

How to evaluate sentiment classifiers for Twitter time-ordered data? (Igor MozetiÄ - 14 March, 2018)
Social media are becoming an increasingly important source of information about the public mood regarding issues such as elections, Brexit, stock market, etc. We collected a large set of 1.5 million tweets in 13 European languages. We created 138 sentiment models and out-of-sample datasets, which are used as a gold standard for evaluations. The corresponding 138 in-sample datasets are used to empirically compare six different estimation procedures: three variants of cross-validation, and three variants of sequential validation (where test set always follows the training set)

Hate Speech Detection: A Solved Problem? The Challenging Case of Long Tail on Twitter (Ziqi Zhang - 27 February, 2018)
This work undertakes the first in-depth analysis towards this problem and shows that, the very challenging nature of identifying hate speech on the social media is largely due to the extremely unbalanced presence of real hateful content in the typical datasets, and the lack of unique, discriminative features in such content, both causing them to reside in the 'long tail' of a dataset that is difficult to discover. We empirically evaluate our methods on the largest collection of hate speech datasets based on Twitter, and show that our methods can significantly outperform state of the art, as they are able to obtain a maximum improvement of between 4 and 16 percentage points (macro-average F1) depending on datasets.

Multimodal Named Entity Recognition for Short Social Media Posts (Seungwhan Moon - 21 February, 2018)
These social media posts often come in inconsistent or incomplete syntax and lexical notations with very limited surrounding textual contexts, bringing significant challenges for NER. We then build upon the state-of-the-art Bi-LSTM word/character based NER models with 1) a deep image network which incorporates relevant visual context to augment textual information, and 2) a generic modality-attention module which learns to attenuate irrelevant modalities while amplifying the most informative ones to extract contexts from, adaptive to each sample and token. The proposed MNER model with modality attention significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art text-only NER models by successfully leveraging provided visual contexts, opening up potential applications of MNER on myriads of social media platforms.

One-Hop Out-of-Band Control Planes for Low-Power Multi-Hop Wireless Networks (Chaojie Gu - 16 December, 2017)
Several characteristics of LoRaWAN such as downlink-uplink asymmetry and primitive ALOHA media access control (MAC) present challenges to achieving reliability and efficiency. On a testbed of 16 nodes, we demonstrate applying LoRaCP to physically separate the control-plane network of the Collection Tree Protocol (CTP) from its ZigBee-based data-plane network. Extensive experiments show that LoRaCP increases CTP's packet delivery ratio from 65% to 80% in the presence of external interference, while consuming a per-node average radio power of 2.97mW only.

In contrast to traditional, monologic Natural Language Processing resources such as news, highly social dialogue is frequent in social media, making it a challenging context for NLP. The best performing classifier for the first phase achieves 54% precision and 38% recall for sarcastic utterances. We then use general syntactic patterns from previous work to create more general sarcasm indicators, improving precision to 62% and recall to 52%. Our first phase, using crowdsourced nasty indicators, achieves 58% precision and 49% recall, which increases to 75% precision and 62% recall when we bootstrap over the first level with generalized syntactic patterns.

Exploring the Ideological Nature of Journalists' Social Networks on Twitter and Associations with News Story Content (John Wihbey - 30 August, 2017)
The present work proposes the use of social media as a tool for better understanding the relationship between a journalists' social network and the content they produce. Specifically, we ask: what is the relationship between the ideological leaning of a journalist's social network on Twitter and the news content he or she produces? Using a novel dataset linking over 500,000 news articles produced by 1,000 journalists at 25 different news outlets, we show a modest correlation between the ideologies of who a journalist follows on Twitter and the content he or she produces

In order to contribute to the analysis of these processes, we present a quantitative study of the social media activities of a contemporary nationwide protest movement against local refugee housing in Germany, which organizes itself via dedicated Facebook pages per city. We analyse data from 136 such protest pages in 2015, containing more than 46,000 posts and more than one million interactions by more than 200,000 users. We find several activity metrics such as the number of posts issued, discussion volume about crime and housing costs, negative polarity in comments, and user engagement to peak in late 2015, coinciding with chancellor Angela Merkel's much criticized decision of September 2015 to temporarily admit the entry of Syrian refugees to Germany

To overcome these drawbacks, the proposed Twitter100k dataset is characterized by two aspects: 1) it has 100,000 image-text pairs randomly crawled from Twitter and thus has no constraint in the image categories; 2) text in Twitter100k is written in informal language by the users.

Is this word borrowed? An automatic approach to quantify the likeliness of borrowing in social media (Jasabanta Patro - 15 March, 2017)
We first propose context based clustering method to sample a set of candidate words from the social media data.Next, we propose three novel and similar metrics based on the usage of these words by the users in different tweets; these metrics were used to score and rank the candidate words indicating their borrowed likeliness. The Spearman's rank correlation between the two rankings (nearly 0.62 for all the three metric variants) is more than double the value (0.26) of the most competitive existing baseline reported in the literature. Some other striking observations are, (i) the correlation is higher for the ground truth data elicited from the younger participants (age less than 30) than that from the older participants, and (ii )those participants who use mixed-language for tweeting the least, provide the best signals of borrowing.

By analyzing two large longitudinal Brazilian Twitter datasets containing 5 years of conversations on two polarizing topics - Politics and Sports - we empirically demonstrate that groups holding antagonistic views can actually retweet each other more often than they retweet other groups

Cats and Captions vs. Creators and the Clock: Comparing Multimodal Content to Context in Predicting Relative Popularity (Jack Hessel - 5 March, 2017)

First, we focus on ranking pairs of submissions posted to the same community in quick succession, e.g., within 30 seconds, this framing encourages models to focus on time-agnostic and community-specific content features
