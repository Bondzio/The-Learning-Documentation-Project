DOTIFS: spectrograph optical and opto-mechanical design (Haeun Chung - 8 October, 2018)
Devasthal Optical Telescope Integral Field Spectrograph (DOTIFS) is a new multi-Integral Field Unit (IFU) instrument, planned to be mounted on the 3.6m Devasthal optical telescope in Nainital, India. It has eight identical, fiber-fed spectrographs to disperse light coming from 16 IFUs. It is composed of all-refractive, all spherical optics designed to achieve on average 26.0% throughput from the telescope to the CCD with the help of high transmission spectrograph optics, volume phase holographic grating, and graded coated e2v 2K by 4K CCD

DOTIFS: a new multi-IFU optical spectrograph for the 3.6-m Devasthal optical telescope (Haeun Chung - 8 October, 2018)
Devasthal Optical Telescope Integral Field Spectrograph (DOTIFS) is a new multi-object Integral Field Spectrograph (IFS) being designed and fabricated by the Inter-University Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA), Pune, India, for the Cassegrain side port of the 3.6m Devasthal Optical Telescope, (DOT) being constructed by the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES), Nainital. It consists of one magnifier, 16 integral field units (IFUs), and 8 spectrographs. Each IFU is comprised of a microlens array and optical fibers and has 7.4'' x 8.7'' field of view with 144 spaxel elements, each sampling 0.8'' hexagonal aperture. The IFUs can be distributed on the telescope side port over an 8' diameter focal plane by the deployment system. The total throughput of the instrument including the telescope is predicted as 27.5% on average. The instrument is expected to see its first light in 2016.

Simulation of muon-induced neutral particle background for a shallow depth Iron Calorimeter detector (Neha Panchal - 24 September, 2018)
The Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) detector at the India based Neutrino Observatory (INO) is planned to be set up in an underground cavern with a rock overburden of more than 1 km. This overburden reduces the cosmic muon flux by a factor of 10$^{6}$ with respect to that at sea level. In this paper, we examine the possibility of a 100 m shallow depth ICAL (SICAL) detector. The cosmic muons would have to be detected in a veto detector surrounding ICAL with an efficiency of 99.99 % in order to have the same level of muon background leaking undetected through the veto detector as at the 1 km depth underground site

Onboard Automated CME Detection Algorithm for Visible Emission Line Coronagraph on ADITYA-L1 (Ritesh Patel - 20 June, 2018)
ADITYA-L1 is India's first space mission to study the Sun from Lagrangian 1 position. { \textit{Visible Emission Line Coronagraph}} (VELC) is one of the seven payloads in ADITYA-L1 mission scheduled to be launched around 2020. This will be accomplished by taking high resolution ($\approx$ 2.51 arcsec pixel$^{-1}$) images of corona from 1.05 R$_{\odot}$ -- 3 R$_{\odot}$ at high cadence of 1 s in 10 Ã passband centered at 5000 Ã. Due to limited telemetry at Lagrangian 1 position we plan to implement an onboard automated CME detection algorithm. We found that for VELC images, the telemetry can be reduced by a factor of 85\% or more keeping CME detection rate of 70\% or above at the same time

The cosmological impact of future constraints on $H_0$ from gravitational-wave standard sirens (Eleonora Di Valentino - 1 October, 2018)
These accuracies are within reach of future standard siren measurements from the Hanford-Livingston-Virgo and the Hanford-Livingston-Virgo-Japan-India networks of interferometers, showing the cosmological relevance of these sources. If future gravitational-wave standard siren measurements reach $1\%$ on $H_0$, as expected, they would significantly improve future CMB+BAO constraints on curvature and on the dark energy equation of state by up to a factor $\sim 3$. We also show that the inclusion of $H_0$ constraints from gravitational-wave standard sirens could result in a reduction of the dark energy figure-of-merit (i.e., the cosmological parameter volume) by up to a factor of $\sim 400$.

Prospects of indirect searches for dark matter annihilations in the earth with ICAL@INO (Deepak Tiwari - 13 June, 2018)
We study the prospects of detecting muon events at the upcoming Iron CALorimeter (ICAL) detector to be built at the proposed India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) facility due to neutrinos arising out of annihilation of Weakly Interactive Massive Particles (WIMP) in the centre of the earth. We consider 50kt $\times$ 10 years of ICAL running and WIMP masses between 10-100 GeV and present 90 \% C.L. For a WIMP mass of ~$52.14 \textup{ GeV}$, where the signal fluxes are enhanced due to resonance capture of WIMP in earth due to Fe nuclei, the sensitivity limits, assuming 100\% branching ratio for each channel, are : $Ï_{SI} =1.02\times 10^{-44}~cm^2$ for the $Ï^{+} Ï^{-}$ channel and $Ï_{SI} =5.36\times 10^{-44} ~cm^2$ for the $b ~\bar{b}$ channel.

Was the cosmic ray burst detected by the GRAPES-3 on 22 June 2015 caused by transient weakening of geomagnetic field or by an interplanetary anisotropy? (P. K. Mohanty - 28 March, 2018)
The GRAPES-3 muon telescope in Ooty, India had claimed detection of a 2 hour (h) high-energy ($\sim$20 GeV) burst of galactic cosmic-rays (GCRs) through a $>$50$Ï$ surge in GeV muons, was caused by reconnection of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) in the magnetosphere that led to transient weakening of Earth's magnetic shield. This burst had occurred during a G4-class geomagnetic storm (storm) with a delay of $\frac{1}{2}$h relative to the coronal mass ejection (CME) of 22 June 2015 (Mohanty et al., 2016). However, recently a group interpreted the occurrence of the same burst in a subset of 31 neutron monitors (NMs) to have been the result of an anisotropy in interplanetary space (Evenson et al., 2017) in contrast to the claim in (Mohanty et al., 2016). A new analysis of the GRAPES-3 data with a fine 10.6$^{\circ}$ angular segmentation shows the speculation of interplanetary anisotropy to be incorrect, and offers a possible explanation of the NM observations. The observed 28 minutes (min) delay of the burst relative to the CME can be explained by the movement of the reconnection front from the bow shock to the surface of Earth at an average speed of 35 km/s, much lower than the CME speed of 700 km/s

Prospects of Indirect Searches for Dark Matter at INO (Sandhya Choubey - 3 May, 2018)
We study the prospects of searching for these neutrinos at the upcoming Iron CALorimeter (ICAL) detector to be housed at the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). For a given WIMP mass, we find the opening angle $Î¸_{90}$ such that 90 \% of the signal events are contained within this angle and use this cone-cut criteria to reduce the atmospheric neutrino background. For a 10 years exposure and $m_Ï=25$ GeV, the expected 90 \% C.L. exclusion limit is found to be $Ï_{SD} < 6.87\times 10^{-41}$ cm$^2$ and $Ï_{SI} < 7.75\times 10^{-43}$ cm$^2$ for the $Ï^{+} Ï^{-}$ annihilation channel and $Ï_{SD} < 1.14\times 10^{-39}$ cm$^2$ and $Ï_{SI} < 1.30\times 10^{-41}$ cm$^2$ for the $b~\bar b $ channel, assuming 100 \% branching ratio for each of the WIMP annihilation channel.

The estimated values of $Q_P^{-1}$ and $Q_S^{-1}$ show strong frequency dependence. The relationships emerge to be $Q_P^{-1}=(23.8\pm 6)\times10^{-3}f^{-1.2\pm 0.008}$ and $Q_S^{-1}=(10.2\pm 2)\times10^{-3}f^{-1.3\pm 0.02}$, respectively.

Indirect searches of Galactic diffuse dark matter in INO-MagICAL detector (Amina Khatun - 6 June, 2017)
We show that the proposed 50 kt Magnetized Iron CALorimeter (MagICAL) detector under the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) project can play an important role in the indirect searches of Galactic diffuse dark matter in the neutrino and antineutrino mode separately. We present the sensitivity of 500 kt$\cdot$yr MagICAL detector to set limits on the velocity-averaged self-annihilation cross-section ($\langleÏv\rangle$) and decay lifetime ($Ï$) of dark matter having mass in the range of 2 GeV $\leq m_Ï\leq $ 90 GeV and 4 GeV $\leq m_Ï\leq $ 180 GeV respectively, assuming no excess over the conventional atmospheric neutrino and antineutrino fluxes at the INO site. We show that MagICAL will be able to set competitive constraints, $\langleÏv\rangle\leq 1.87\,\times\,10^{-24}$ cm$^3$ s$^{-1}$ for $ÏÏ\rightarrowÎ½\barÎ½$ and $Ï\geq 4.8\,\times\,10^{24}$ s for $Ï\rightarrowÎ½\barÎ½$ at 90$\%$ C.L.

Performance of Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters in a Balloon Experiment (J. Roy - 12 September, 2016)
ASTROSAT is India's first satellite fully devoted to astronomical observations covering a wide spectral band from optical to hard X-rays by a complement of 4 co-aligned instruments and a Scanning Sky X-ray Monitor. One of the instruments is Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter with 3 identical detectors. In order to assess the performance of this instrument, a balloon experiment with two prototype Large Area X-ray Proportional Counters (LAXPC) was carried out on 2008 April 14. The design of these LAXPCs was similar to those on the ASTROSAT except that their field of view (FOV) was 3$^{\circ}$ $\times$ 3$^{\circ}$ versus FOV of 1$^{\circ}$ $\times$ 1$^{\circ}$ for the LAXPCs on the ASTROSAT. The details of the experiment and background counting rates of the 2 LAXPCs at the float altitude of about 41 km are presented in different energy bands. The bright black hole X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 (Cyg X-1) was observed in the experiment for $\sim$ 3 hours

Precision velocimetry planet hunting with PARAS: Current performance and lessons to inform future extreme precision radial velocity instruments (Arpita Roy - 21 July, 2016)
Abu India. Designed for exoplanet detection, PARAS is capable of single-shot spectral coverage of 3800 - 9600 A, and currently achieving radial velocity (RV) precisions approaching ~1 m/s over several months using simultaneous ThAr calibration. The success of ground-based RV surveys is motivating the push into extreme precisions, with goals of ~10 cm/s in the optical and <1 m/s in the near-infrared (NIR). Secondly, we discuss how our experience with PARAS is a critical component in the development of future cutting edge instruments like (1) the Habitable Zone Planet Finder (HPF), a NIR spectrograph optimized to look for planets around M dwarfs, scheduled to be commissioned on the Hobby Eberly Telescope in 2017, and (2) the NEID optical spectrograph, designed in response to the NN-EXPLORE call for an extreme precision Doppler spectrometer (EPDS) for the WIYN telescope

The inclusion of events from all zenith angles improves the sensitivity to sterile neutrino mixing by about 35$\%$ over the result obtained using only down-going events. At the assumed true value of $10^\circ$ for the sterile mixing angles and marginalization over $Îm^2_{41}$ and the sterile mixing angles, the upper bound at 90\% C.L. (from 2 parameter plots) is around $20^\circ$ for $Î¸_{14}$ and $Î¸_{34}$, and about $12^\circ$ for $Î¸_{24}$.

Pinning down neutrino oscillation parameters in the 2-3 sector with a mgnetised atmospheric neutrino detector: a new study (Lakshmi S. Mohan - 20 June, 2016)
We determine the sensitivity to neutrino oscillation parameters from a study of atmospheric neutrinos in a magnetised detector such as the ICAL at the proposed India-based Neutrino Observatory. In such a detector that can {\em separately} count $Î½_Î¼$ and $\overlineÎ½_Î¼$-induced events, the relatively smaller (about 5\%) uncertainties on the neutrino--anti-neutrino flux ratios translate to a constraint in the $Ï^2$ analysis that results in a significant improvement in the precision with which neutrino oscillation parameters such as $\sin^2Î¸_{23}$ can be determined. Along with an increase in the kinematic range compared to earlier analyses, this results in sensitivities to oscillation parameters in the 2--3 sector that are comparable to or better than those from accelerator experiments where the fluxes are significantly higher. For example, the $1Ï$ precisions on $\sin^2Î¸_{23}$ and $|Î{m^2_{32(31)}}|$ achievable for 500 kTon yr exposure of ICAL are $\sim9\%$ and $\sim2.5\%$ respectively for both normal and inverted hierarchies

The neutron production rate due to the spontaneous fission of $^{235, 238}$U, $^{232}$Th and ($Î±, n$) interactions in the rock is determined employing the actual rock composition. The energy integrated neutron flux thus obtained at the centre of the underground tunnel is 2.76 (0.47) $\times 10^{-6}\rm~n ~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$. The estimated neutron flux is of the same order ($\sim10^{-6}\rm~n ~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$)~as measured in other underground laboratories.

Furthermore, age of child (OR=0.92, 95% CI: 0.86-1.00) was a significant predictor, indicating that odds of severe anemia decreases if the child is 48 months or older.

Mobile Phone Based Vehicle License Plate Recognition for Road Policing (Lajish V. L. - 7 April, 2015)
The security situation across the globe and particularly in India demands a need to equip the traffic police with a system that enables them to get instant details of a vehicle. The system should be easy to use, should be mobile, and work 24 x 7. While we use the state of the art image processing and pattern recognition algorithms tuned for Indian conditions to automatically recognize non-uniform license plates, the main contribution is in creating an end to end usable solution

SN 2013ab : A normal type IIP supernova in NGC 5669 (Subhash Bose - 24 April, 2015)
Continuous photometric observations, with the cadence of typically a day to one week, were acquired with the 1-2m class telescopes in the LCOGT network, ARIES telescopes in India and various other telescopes around the globe. The light curve and spectra suggest that the SN is a normal type IIP event with a plateau duration of $ \sim80 $ days with mid plateau absolute visual magnitude of -16.7, although with a steeper decline during the plateau (0.92 mag 100 d$ ^{-1} $ in $ V $ band) relative to other archetypal SNe of similar brightness. Following the Rabinak & Waxman (2011) prescription, the initial temperature evolution of the SN emission allows us to estimate the progenitor radius to be $ \sim $ 800 R$_{\odot}$, indicating that the SN originated from a red supergiant star. The distance to the SN host galaxy is estimated to be 24.3 Mpc from expanding photosphere method (EPM). From our observations, we estimate that 0.064 M$_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni was synthesized in the explosion. General relativistic, radiation hydrodynamical modeling of the SN infers an explosion energy of $ 0.35\times10^{51} $ erg, a progenitor mass (at the time of explosion) of $ \sim9 $ M$_{\odot}$ and an initial radius of $ \sim600 $ R$_{\odot}$.

Designing Low Cost and Energy Efficient Access Network for the Developing World (Kshitiz Verma - 16 January, 2015)
Our survey of four networks in India, all having at least one thousand users, suggest that both installation cost and recurring cost due to power consumption pose a challenge in its deployment in developing countries. In this paper, we first model the access design problem by dividing the users in two types 1) those that may access the network anytime and 2) those who need it only during office hours on working days. We evaluate our model and heuristic using real data collected from IIT Kanpur LAN for more than 50 days. Results show that even in a tree topology -- which is a common characteristic of all networks who participated in our study, our design can reduce the energy consumption of the network by up to 11% in residential-cum-office environments and up to 22% in office-only environments in comparison with current methods without giving up on the performance

Comets in ancient India (Patrick Das Gupta - 30 November, 2014)
The Indo-aryans of ancient India observed stars and constellations for ascertaining auspicious times in order to conduct sacrificial rites ordained by vedas. In Rigveda ($\sim $ 1700 - 1500 BC) and Atharvaveda ($\sim $ 1150 BC), there are references to dhumaketus and ketus, which stand for comets in Sanskrit. Rigveda mentions a fig tree with roots held up in the sky (Parpola 2009, 2010). Could it have been inspired by the hirsute appearance of a comet's tail? Similarly, could `Ketu' (the torso or the tail part of Rahu) be a Dravidian loan word, since `kottu', an old Tamil word, is associated with scorpion's sting and top tuft of hair? Varahamihira in 550 AD and Ballal Sena ($\sim $ 1100 - 1200 AD) have described a large number of comets recorded by ancient seers such as Parashara, Vriddha Garga, Narada, Garga, etc

Bhabha, the Director of TIFR, made the decisive offer to this group to start a radio astronomy project in early 1962. Swarup joined TIFR in early April 1963. Many factors contributed to the successful formation of the new group: international networking among scientists of several generations, rapid decisions by Bhabha and the readiness to take chances in choosing promising, young, energetic scientists.In December 2013, we have celebrated 50 years of ground breaking research by the TIFR radio astronomers as well as the outstanding decade of research with the GMRT- the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope

Probing Lorentz and CPT Violation in a Magnetized Iron Detector using Atmospheric Neutrinos (Animesh Chatterjee - 25 February, 2014)
We study the sensitivity of the Iron Calorimeter (ICAL) at the India-Based Neutrino Observatory (INO) to Lorentz and CPT violation in the neutrino sector. Using resolution, efficiencies, errors and uncertainties obtained from ICAL detector simulations, we determine sensitivities to $Î´{b}_{31}$, which parametizes the violations in the muon neutrino sector. We carry out calculations for three generic cases representing mixing in the CPT violating part of the hamiltonian, specifically, when the mixing is 1) small, 2) large, 3) the same as that in the PMNS matrix. We find that for both types of hierarchy, ICAL at INO should be sensitive to $Î´{b}_{31}$ $\gtrsim$ $4\times10^{-23}$ GeV at 99% C.L. for 500 kt-yr exposure, unless the mixing in the CPT violation sector is small.

Ancient eclipses and long-term drifts in the Earth - Moon system (M. N. Vahia - 30 July, 2013)
We identify nine groups of anomalous eclipses between 400 and 1800 AD recorded in parts of India that should have completely missed the subcontinent as per NASA simulations (Espenak and Meeus, 2011). We show that 80 percent of these discrepancies occur when the Moon is at declinations greater than 10 deg and closer to its major standstill of 28 deg while it spends 46 percent of the time in this region

Solar wind reflection from the lunar surface: The view from far and near (L. Saul - 16 June, 2013)
These ENAs have recently been imaged over a broad energy range both from near the lunar surface, by India's Chandrayaan-1 mission (CH-1), and from a much more distant Earth orbit by NASA's Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) satellite. The deduced global reflection is modestly larger (by a factor of 1.25) when the angular scattering function is included. This provides a slightly updated IBEX estimate of AH = 0.11 +/- 0.06 for the global neutralized albedo, which is 25 % larger than the previous values of 0.09 +/- 0.05, based on an assumed uniform scattering distribution.

Environmental flow for Monsoon Rivers in India: The Yamuna River as a case study (Vikram Soni - 12 June, 2013)
About 80% of the total flow for Indian rivers is during the monsoon and the remaining 20% is during the non monsoon period. By carrying out a case study of the river Yamuna in Delhi we find that at least 50% of the virgin monsoon (July to September) flow is required for the transport of the full spectrum of soil particles in the river sediment. For the non monsoon period (October to June) about 60% of the virgin flow is necessary to avoid the growth of still water algae and to support river biodiversity.

R0 and the elimination of HIV in Africa: Will 90-90-90 be sufficient? (Brian G. Williams - 14 July, 2014)
Here we first estimate the case reproduction number, R0, for countries in sub-Saharan Africa and for India using data on the rate at which the prevalence of HIV increased at the start of the epidemic and the life expectancy of people living with HIV who are not on ART. We show that in sub-Saharan Africa the median value of R0 is 4.6 and in all but five countries R0 is less than 6.3. If the 90-90-90 target is reached, 73% of all those living with HIV will have full viral load suppression. If this is maintained it should guarantee elimination in 70% of all countries in sub-Saharan Africa and will reduce R0 to less than 2 in the remaining 12 countries, making elimination easy to achieve by increasing the availability of other high impact methods of prevention.

Outlook for detection of GW inspirals by GRB-triggered searches in the Advanced detector era (Alexander Dietz - 25 April, 2013)
If this scenario is correct, then short GRBs will be accompanied by the emission of strong gravitational waves (GWs), detectable by GW observatories such as LIGO, Virgo, KAGRA, and LIGO-India. Based on the distribution of signal-to-noise ratios in candidate compact binary coalescence events in the most recent joint LIGO-Virgo data, our analytic estimates, and our Monte Carlo simulations, we find an effective sensitive volume for GRB-triggered searches that is about 2 times greater than for an all-sky, all-time search. For NS-NS systems, a jet angle of 20 degrees, a gamma-ray satellite field of view of 10% of the sky, and priors with generally precessing spin, this doubles the number of NS-NS short-GRB and NS-BH short-GRB associations, to ~3-4% of all detections of NS-NSs and NS-BHs

Multiwavelength study of TeV Blazar Mrk421 during giant flare and observations of TeV AGNs with HAGAR (A. Shukla - 31 October, 2011)
HAGAR is an array of seven telescopes located at Hanle, India to detect Cherenkov light caused by extensive air showers initiated by $Î³$-rays. Mrk421 was observed to undergo one of its brightest flaring episodes on 2010 February 17, and detected by various experiments in X-rays and $Î³$- rays. HAGAR observations of this source during 2010 February 13 - 19, in the energies above 250 GeV show an enhancement in the flux level, with a flux of 6-7 Crab units being detected on 2010 February 17

TeV Gamma-Ray Observations of Mrk421 and H1426+428 with TACTIC Imaging Telescope (Kuldeep Yadav - 9 September, 2011)
We have observed extragalactic sources Mrk421 (z=0.30) and H1426+428 (z=0.129) in very high energy gamma region using TACTIC telescope at Mount Abu, Rajasthan, India. Mrk421 was observed during 07 December 2005 to 18 April 2007 for a total of ~331hours while H1426+428 was observed for ~244 hours between 22 March 2004 and 11 June 2007. Detailed analysis of Mrk421 data revealed the presence of a gamma signal with the excess of (~951\pm 82) gamma like events corresponding to a statistical significance of ~12.0 Ïin ~97 hours during 27 December 2005 to 07 February 2006. Observed time averaged differential energy spectrum was found to be consistent with both a pure power law $dÎ¦/dE=(4.66\pm0.46)\times 10^{-11}\,E^{(-3.11\pm0.11)}\,\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,TeV^{-1}$ and power law with an exponential cutoff functions $dÎ¦/dE=f_0E^{-Î}exp(-E/E_0)$ with $f_0=(4.88\pm0.38)\times10^{-11}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,TeV^{-1}$, $Î=2.51\pm0.26$ and $E_0=(4.7\pm2.1)TeV$. However, during the observation period from 18 December 2006 to 18 April 2007, the source was found to be in a low emission state and we have placed an upper limit of $1.44\times\,10^{-12}\,photons\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ at $3Ï$ level on the integrated \gam flux above $1\,TeV$. Accordingly we have placed an upper limit of $\leq1.18\times10^{-12}\,photons\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ on the integrated $Î³$-ray flux above $1\,TeV$ at 3$Ï$ significance level.

The topology and polarization of subbeams associated with drifting subpulse emission of pulsar B0943+10 - VI. Analysis of an 8-hour GMRT observation (Isaac Backus - 5 September, 2011)
We report analysis of an 8 hr observation of PSR B0943+10 at 325 MHz performed at the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) in India. By reconstructing an entire 'B' mode from two consecutive 'B' modes, we estimate that the pulsar spends roughly 7.5 hrs in the 'B' mode and about 2.2 hrs in the 'Q' mode, on average. Although the pulsar can switch modes within one pulse, the sub-pulse drift rate changes with a characteristic time of 1.2 hrs over the course of a 'B' mode. Under the subbeam carousel model we find the drift-rate changes are produced by a 10% increase in the average number of subbeams and a 16% increase in the carousel circulation time

Networks of gravitational wave detectors and three figures of merit (Bernard F. Schutz - 25 April, 2011)
This paper develops a general framework for studying the effectiveness of networks of interferometric gravitational wave detectors and then uses it to show that enlarging the existing LIGO-VIRGO network with one or more planned or proposed detectors in Japan (LCGT), Australia, and India brings major benefits, including much larger detection rate increases than previously thought... I show that there is a universal probability distribution function (pdf) for detected SNR values, which implies that the most likely SNR value of the first detected event will be 1.26 times the search threshold. For binary systems, I also derive the universal pdf for detected values of the orbital inclination, taking into account the Malmquist bias; this implies that the number of gamma-ray bursts associated with detected binary coalescences should be 3.4 times larger than expected from just the beaming fraction of the gamma burst. Adding {\em any} new site to the planned LIGO-VIRGO network can dramatically increase, by factors of 2 to 4, the detected event rate by allowing coherent data analysis to reduce the spurious instrumental coincident background. Moving one of the LIGO detectors to Australia additionally improves direction-finding by a factor of 4 or more. Adding LCGT to the original LIGO-VIRGO network not only improves direction-finding but will further increase the detection rate over the extra-site gain by factors of almost 2, partly by improving the network duty cycle..

Growth and replication of red rain cells at 121 oC and their red fluorescence (Rajkumar Gangappa - 29 August, 2010)
We have shown that the red cells found in the Red Rain (which fell on Kerala, India, in 2001) survive and grow after incubation for periods of up to two hours at 121 oC . Under these conditions daughter cells appear within the original mother cells and the number of cells in the samples increases with length of exposure to 121 oC. This is an independent confirmation of results reported earlier by two of the present authors, claiming that the cells can replicate under high pressure at temperatures up to 300 oC

We analyze the time-series data for the onset of A(H1N1)v influenza pandemic in India during the period June 1- September 30, 2009. Using a variety of statistical fitting procedures, we obtain a robust estimate of the exponential growth rate $\langle Î»\rangle \simeq 0.15$. This corresponds to a basic reproductive number $R_0 \simeq 1.45$ for influenza A(H1N1)v in India, a value which lies towards the lower end of the range of values reported for different countries affected by the pandemic.
