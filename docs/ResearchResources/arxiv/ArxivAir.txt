LED-it-GO: Leaking (a lot of) Data from Air-Gapped Computers via the (small) Hard Drive LED (Mordechai Guri - 22 February, 2017)
In this paper we present a method which allows attackers to covertly leak data from isolated, air-gapped computers. We show that a malware can indirectly control the HDD LED, turning it on and off rapidly (up to 5800 blinks per second) - a rate that exceeds the visual perception capabilities of humans. Our experiment shows that sensitive data can be successfully leaked from air-gapped computers via the HDD LED at a maximum bit rate of 4000 bits per second, depending on the type of receiver and its distance from the transmitter. Notably, this speed is 10 times faster than the existing optical covert channels for air-gapped computers

Latency-Optimal Uplink Scheduling Policy in Training-based Large-Scale Antenna Systems (Kyung Jun Choi - 26 July, 2016)

In other regimes ($Ï\ll 1$ or $ M\gg \log^2Ï$), it turns out that non-orthogonal pilots become optimal. More rigorously, the use of non-orthogonal pilots can reduce the network latency by a factor of $Î(M)$ when $Ï\ll 1$ or by a factor of $Î(\sqrt{M}/\log M)$ when $Ï\gg 1$ and $M\gg \logÏ$, which would be a critical guideline for designing 5G future cellular systems.

Statistical Distribution of Intensity Fluctuations for Underwater Wireless Optical Channels in the Presence of Air Bubbles (Mohammad Vahid Jamali - 13 March, 2016)
Our experimental results show that salt attenuates the received signal while air bubbles mainly introduce severe intensity fluctuations. Moreover, we observe that log-normal distribution precisely fits the acquired data PDF for scintillation index ($Ï^2_I$) values less than $0.1$, while Gamma-Gamma and K distributions aptly predict the intensity fluctuations for $Ï^2_I>1$. Since neither of these distributions are capable of predicting the received irradiance for $0.1<Ï^2_I<1$, we propose a combination of an exponential and a log-normal distributions to perfectly describe the acquired data PDF for such regimes of scintillation index.

Flexibility of Commercial Building HVAC Fan as Ancillary Service for Smart Grid (Mehdi Maasoumy - 24 November, 2013)

We estimate that at least 4 GW of regulation reserve is readily available only through commercial buildings in the US. Based on predictions this value will reach to 5.6 GW in 2035

Building design in tropical climates. Elaboration of the ECODOM standard in the french tropical islands (FranÃ§ois Garde - 21 December, 2012)
Electric load profiles of tropical islands in developed countries are characterised by morning, midday and evening peaks arising from all year round high power demand in the commercial and residential sectors, mostly due to air conditioning appliances and bad thermal conception of the building. In early 1995, a DSM pilot initiative has been launched in the french islands of Guadeloupe and Reunion through a partnership between the French Public Utility EDF, institutions involved in energy conservation, environment preservation (ADEME) and construction quality improvment, the University of Reunion Island and several other public and private partners (low cost housing institutions, architects, energy consultant, etc...) to set up a standard in the thermal conception of buildings in tropical climates. These technical solutions have been edited in a pedagogical reference document and have been implemented in 300 new pilot dwelling projects through the year 1996 in Reunion Island and in Guadeloupe island

Prospects for Improving Competition in Mobile Roaming (Ulrich Stumpf - 22 October, 2001)
The paper analyses the structural conditions of wholesale roaming markets that have impaired incentives to competition, namely high combined market share of the two leading GSM 900 operators combined with second mover disadvantages for new entrant GSM 1800 operators, and demand externalities. As dual mode handsets become ubiquitous and as new entrant GSM 1800 operators reach nationwide coverage, second-mover disadvantages will disappear. Given the relatively small roaming volumes that GSM 1800 operators currently provide, they should have an incentive to lower charges in exchange for preferred roaming status. On the demand side of wholesale roaming markets, it will be the larger GSM 900 operators, and in particular those with a pan-European footprint, that will ask for lower charges in exchange for preferred roaming status

In particular, we explore strategies for pairing serving and served access nodes, partitioning the available network resources, as well as dynamically allocating power per pair, towards optimizing system performance and guaranteeing individual minimum performance levels

A customized flocking algorithm for swarms of sensors tracking a swarm of targets (Anupam Shukla - 12 November, 2013)
Sensor networks have a wide range of applications in security and surveillance systems, environmental monitoring, data gathering for network-centric healthcare systems, monitoring seismic activities and atmospheric events, tracking traffic congestion and air pollution levels, localization of autonomous vehicles in intelligent transportation systems, and detecting failures of sensing, storage, and switching components of smart grids. To optimize the resources we need to have an approach that works in a more straightforward manner while resulting in fairly satisfactory data

Aircraft Landing Problem: Efficient Algorithm for a Given Landing Sequence (Abhishek Awasthi - 26 October, 2013)
The objective of this well-known NP-hard optimization problem is to minimize the sum of the total penalty incurred by all the aircraft for arriving earlier or later than their preferred landing times. For a problem variant that optimizes a given feasible landing sequence for the single runway case, we present an exact polynomial algorithm and prove the run-time complexity to lie in $O(N^3)$, where $N$ is the number of aircraft

Automatic Airspace Sectorisation: A Survey (Pierre Flener - 4 November, 2013)
Airspace sectorisation provides a partition of a given airspace into sectors, subject to geometric constraints and workload constraints, so that some cost metric is minimised. We survey the algorithmic aspects of methods for automatic airspace sectorisation, for an intended readership of experts on air traffic management.

An Extreme Learning Machine Approach to Predicting Near Chaotic HCCI Combustion Phasing in Real-Time (Adam Vaughan - 5 May, 2015)
Fuel efficient Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) engine combustion timing predictions must contend with non-linear chemistry, non-linear physics, period doubling bifurcation(s), turbulent mixing, model parameters that can drift day-to-day, and air-fuel mixture state information that cannot typically be resolved on a cycle-to-cycle basis, especially during transients

Traveling Trends: Social Butterflies or Frequent Fliers? (Emilio Ferrara - 9 October, 2013)
We identify two main classes of trending topics: those that surface locally, coinciding with three different geographic clusters (East coast, Midwest and Southwest); and those that emerge globally from several metropolitan areas, coinciding with the major air traffic hubs of the country. This poses an intriguing conjecture, drawing a parallel between the spread of information and diseases: Do trends travel faster by airplane than over the Internet?
