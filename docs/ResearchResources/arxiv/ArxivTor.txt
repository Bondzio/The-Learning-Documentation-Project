Fundamental Limits of Invisible Flow Fingerprinting (Ramin Soltani - 22 September, 2018)
Network flow fingerprinting can be used to de-anonymize communications on anonymity systems such as Tor by linking the ingress and egress segments of anonymized connections. Assuming all input flows have equal rates and that Bob observes only flows with fingerprints, we first present two scenarios: 1) Alice fingerprints all the flows; 2) Alice fingerprints a subset of the flows, unknown to Willie

Understanding Tor Usage with Privacy-Preserving Measurement (Akshaya Mani - 22 September, 2018)
Our findings include that Tor has ~8 million daily users (a factor of four more than previously believed) while Tor user IPs turn over almost twice in a 4 day period. We also find that ~40% of the sites accessed over Tor have a torproject.org domain name, ~10% of the sites have an amazon.com domain name, and ~80% of the sites have a domain name that is included in the Alexa top 1 million sites list. Finally, we find that ~90% of lookups for onion addresses are invalid, and more than 90% of attempted connections to onion services fail.

Intrusion Detection and Ubiquitous Host to Host Encryption (Aaron Gibson - 21 November, 2017)
In a world where end-to-end encryption is ubiquitous, what can replace the existing models for network intrusion detection? How can network administrators and operators, responsible for securing networks against hostile activity, protect a network they cannot see? In an encrypted world, signature based event detection is unlikely to prove useful. Our results demonstrate the network intrusion detection system's ability to monitor a network carrying only host-to-host encrypted traffic

We simulate this guard set design using historical Tor data in the presence of both relay-level adversaries and network-level adversaries, and we find that our approach is good at confining the adversary into few guard sets and thus limiting the impact of attacks.
