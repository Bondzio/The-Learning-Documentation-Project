Improving QED-Tutrix by Automating the Generation of Proofs (Ludovic Font - 4 March, 2018)
Mathematics in general, and geometry in particular, provide interesting challenges when developing educative softwares, both in the education and  computer science aspects. It focuses on specific goals: 1) to allow the student to freely explore the problem and its figure, 2) to accept proofs elements in any order, 3) to handle a variety of proofs, which can be customized by the teacher, and 4) to be able to help the student at any step of the resolution of the problem, if the need arises. This automation must follow fundamental constraints in order to create problems compatible with QED-Tutrix: 1) readability of the proofs, 2) accessibility at a high school level, and 3) possibility for the teacher to modify the parameters defining the "acceptability" of a proof

Our preliminary results show that the slow 100 Mbps networking of the raspberry pi significantly limits such clusters to parallel computational tasks that are either long running relative to data communications requirements, or that which requires very little internode communications. Additionally, although the raspberry pi 3 has a quad-core processor, parallel speedup degrades during attempts to utilize all four cores of all cluster nodes for a parallel computation, likely due to resource contention with operating system level processes

Mapping the Curricular Structure and Contents of Network Science Courses (Hiroki Sayama - 15 October, 2017)
As network science has matured as an established field of research, there are already a number of courses on this topic developed and offered at various higher education institutions, often at postgraduate levels. We collected information about 30 existing network science courses from various online sources, and analyzed the contents of their syllabi or course schedules. These results illustrate the current state of consensus formation (including variations and disagreements) among the network science community on what should be taught about networks and how, which may also be informative for K--12 education and informal education.

Computer Self-efficacy and Its Relationship with Web Portal Usage: Evidence from the University of the East (Rex P. Bringula - 8 July, 2017)
The University of the East Web Portal is an academic, web based system that provides educational electronic materials and e-learning services. Data showed that the respondents were relatively young (M = 40 years old), majority had masters degree (f = 85, 72%), most had been using the web portal for four semesters (f = 60, 51%), and the large part were intermediate web portal users (f = 69, 59%). They were highly skilled in using the computer (M = 4.29) and skilled in using the Internet (M = 4.28). E-learning services (M = 3.29) and online library resources (M = 3.12) were only used occasionally. Pearson correlation revealed that age was positively correlated with online library resources (r = 0.267, p < 0.05) and a negative relationship existed between perceived skill level in using the portal and online library resources usage (r = -0.206, p < 0.05). A 2x2 chi square revealed that the highest educational attainment had a significant relationship with online library resources (chi square = 5.489, df = 1, p < 0.05). Basic computer (r = 0.196, p < 0.05) and Internet skills (r = 0.303, p < 0.05) were significantly and positively related with e-learning services usage but not with online library resources usage

Using Deep Learning and Google Street View to Estimate the Demographic Makeup of the US (Timnit Gebru - 2 March, 2017)
The United States spends more than $1B each year on initiatives such as the American Community Survey (ACS), a labor-intensive door-to-door study that measures statistics relating to race, gender, education, occupation, unemployment, and other demographic factors. Here, we present a method that determines socioeconomic trends from 50 million images of street scenes, gathered in 200 American cities by Google Street View cars. Data from this census of motor vehicles, which enumerated 22M automobiles in total (8% of all automobiles in the US), was used to accurately estimate income, race, education, and voting patterns, with single-precinct resolution. (The average US precinct contains approximately 1000 people.) The resulting associations are surprisingly simple and powerful. For instance, if the number of sedans encountered during a 15-minute drive through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely to vote for a Democrat during the next Presidential election (88% chance); otherwise, it is likely to vote Republican (82%)

Design Studio 2.0: Augmenting Reflective Architectural Design Learning (Burak Pak - 6 September, 2015)
When considered in an educational context, Web 2.0 provides various opportunities for enhanced integration and for improving the learning processes in information-rich collaborative disciplines such as urban planning and architectural design. The dialogue between the design students and studio teachers can be mediated in various ways by creating novel learning spaces using Web 2.0-based social software and information aggregation services, and brought to a level where the Web 2.0 environment supports, augments and enriches the reflective learning processes. We propose to call this new setting Design Studio 2.0. We suggest that Design Studio 2.0 can provide numerous opportunities which are not fully or easily available in a conventional design studio setting. As a result, we will introduce a set of key criteria for the development and implementation of an effective e-learning environment as a sustainable platform for supporting the Design Studio 2.0.

Enhancing Curriculum Acceptance among Students with E-learning 2.0 (Kamaljit I. Lakhtaria - 15 April, 2010)
E-learning; enhanced by communicating and interacting is becoming increasingly accepted and this puts Web 2.0 at the center of the new educational technologies. E-Learning 2.0 emerges as an innovative method of online learning for its incorporation of Web 2.0 tools. Students are accepting curriculum that is designed by teacher; whereas E-learning 2.0 enabled Curriculum management system allows student to involve in learning activities. While Institute adapts E-Learning 2.0 as Learning Management System, it also provides Social Networking services and provides direct and transparent interaction between students and teachers. This view of the e-Learning 2.0 shifts its focus from LMS to the students, equipping them, with the means to become ever more autonomous, accepting them to make use of these means in solving problems on their own initiative. Curriculum usage will empower student involvement and enhancing E-learning 2.0 spreading.

Ten-Year Cross-Disciplinary Comparison of the Growth of Open Access and How it Increases Research Citation Impact (C. Hajjem - 15 August, 2006)
We tested 1,307,038 articles published across 12 years (1992-2003) in 10 disciplines (Biology, Psychology, Sociology, Health, Political Science, Economics, Education, Law, Business, Management). A robot trawls the Web for full-texts using reference metadata ISI citation data (signal detectability d'=2.45; bias = 0.52). Percentage OA (relative to total OA + NOA) articles varies from 5%-16% (depending on discipline, year and country) and is slowly climbing annually (correlation r=.76, sample size N=12, probability p < 0.005). Comparing OA and NOA articles in the same journal/year, OA articles have consistently more citations, the advantage varying from 36%-172% by discipline and year. Comparing articles within six citation ranges (0, 1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15, 16+ citations), the annual percentage of OA articles is growing significantly faster than NOA within every citation range (r > .90, N=12, p < .0005) and the effect is greater with the more highly cited articles (r = .98, N=6, p < .005). Causality cannot be determined from these data, but our prior finding of a similar pattern in physics, where percent OA is much higher (and even approaches 100% in some subfields), makes it unlikely that the OA citation advantage is merely or mostly a self-selection bias (for making only one's better articles OA)

"Systems that Explain Themselves" appears a provocative wording, in particular in the context of mathematics education -- it is as provocative as the idea of building educational software upon technology from computer theorem proving. This perspective depends on two moving targets: On the one side the rapidly increasing power and coverage of computer theorem provers and their user interfaces, and on the other side potential users: What can students and teachers request from educational systems based on technology and concepts from computer theorem proving, now and then? By the way of describing the process of prototyping the first comprehensive survey on the state of the ISAC prototype is given as a side effect, made precise by pointers to the code and by citation of all contributing theses.

An Operational Semantic Basis for OpenMP Race Analysis (Simone Atzeni - 13 September, 2017)
OpenMP is the de facto standard to exploit the on-node parallelism in new generation supercomputers.Despite its overall ease of use, even expert users are known to create OpenMP programs that harbor concurrency errors, of which one of the most insidious of errors are {\em data races}.OpenMP is also a rapidly evolving standard, which means that future data races may be introduced within unfamiliar contexts.A simple and rigorous operational semantics for OpenMP can help build reliable race checkers and ward off future errors through programmer education and better tooling.This paper's key contribution is a simple operational semantics for OpenMP, with primitive events matching those generated by today's popular OpenMP runtimes and tracing methods such as OMPT.This makes our operational semantics more than a theoretical document for intellectual edification; it can serve as a blueprint for OpenMP event capture and tool building.We back this statement by summarizing the workings of a new data race checker for OpenMP being built based on this semantics.The larger purpose served by our semantics is to serve the needs of the OpenMP community with regard to their contemplated extensions to OpenMP, as well as future tooling efforts.

Measuring field-normalized impact of papers on specific societal groups: An altmetrics study based on Mendeley data (Lutz Bornmann - 21 February, 2017)
Thus, we extend in this study the field-normalized reader impact indicator proposed by us in an earlier study, which is based on Mendeley data (the mean normalized reader score, MNRS), to a target-oriented field-normalized impact indicator (e.g., MNRS_ED measures reader impact on the sector of educational donation, i.e., teaching). This indicator can show - as demonstrated in empirical examples - the ability of journals, countries, and academic institutions to publish papers which are below or above the average impact of papers on a specific sector in society (e.g., the educational or teaching sector)
