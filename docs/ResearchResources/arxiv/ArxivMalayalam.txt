KS_JU@DPIL-FIRE2016:Detecting Paraphrases in Indian Languages Using Multinomial Logistic Regression Model (Kamal Sarkar - 24 December, 2016)
Out of 11 teams participated in the shared task, only four teams participated in all four languages, Hindi, Punjabi, Malayalam and Tamil, but the remaining 7 teams participated in one of the four languages. The overall average performance of our system including task1 and task2 overall four languages is F1-score of 0.81 which is the second highest score among the four systems that participated in all four languages.

Unsupervised Separation of Transliterable and Native Words for Malayalam (Deepak P - 26 March, 2018)
We consider the problem of unsupervised separation of transliterable words from native words for text in Malayalam language. Using an empirical evaluation, we illustrate that our method, DTIM, provides significant improvements in nativeness scoring for Malayalam, establishing DTIM as the preferred method for the task.

A case study on English-Malayalam Machine Translation (Sreelekha S - 27 February, 2017)
We describe the development of English to Malayalam and Malayalam to English baseline phrase based SMT system and the evaluation of its performance compared against the RBMT system. Based on our study the observations are: a) SMT systems outperform RBMT systems, b) In the case of SMT, English - Malayalam systems perform better than that of Malayalam - English systems, c) In the case RBMT, Malayalam to English systems are performing better than English to Malayalam systems
