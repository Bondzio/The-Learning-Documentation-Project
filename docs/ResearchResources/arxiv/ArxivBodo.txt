Three-dimensional Stable Matching with Cyclic Preferences (Kanstantsin Pashkovich - 28 September, 2018)
In 2004, Boros, Gurvich, Jaslar and Krasner showed that a stable matching always exists when the number of agents in each of the groups is three. In 2006, Eriksson, SjÃ¶strand and Strimling showed that a stable matching exists also when the number of agents in each group is four

Kneser ranks of random graphs and minimum difference representations (ZoltÃ¡n FÃ¼redi - 28 January, 2017)
\] We apply this for other graph representations defined by Boros, Gurvich and Meshulam. Balogh and Prince proved in 2009 that for every $k$ there is a graph $G$ with $f_{\min}(G)\geq k$. We prove that there are constants $c''_1, c''_2>0$ such that $c''_1 n/(\log n)< f_{\min}(G) < c''_2n/(\log n)$ holds for almost all bipartite graphs $G$ on $n+n$ vertices.

Independence complexes of well-covered circulant graphs (Jonathan Earl - 11 May, 2015)
We study the independence complexes of families of well-covered circulant graphs discovered by Boros-Gurvich-MilaniÄ, Brown-Hoshino, and Moussi. We also provide a table of all well-covered circulant graphs on 16 or less vertices, and for each such graph, determine if it is vertex decomposable, shellable, Cohen-Macaulay, and/or Buchsbaum

On a ZoltÃ¡n Boros' problem connected with polynomial-like iterative equations (Szymon Draga - 26 January, 2015)
In particular, we obtain an answer to a problem posed by ZoltÃ¡n Boros (during the Fiftieth International Symposium on Functional Equations, 2012) of determining all continuous functions $f\colon (0,+\infty)\to (0,+\infty)$ satisfying $f^3(x)=\frac{[f(x)]^3}{x^2}$.

On the complexity of the vector connectivity problem (Ferdinando Cicalese - 8 December, 2014)
In the paper introducing the problem, Boros et al. [Networks, 2014] gave polynomial-time solutions for VecCon in trees, cographs, and split graphs, and showed that the problem can be approximated in polynomial time on $n$-vertex graphs to within a factor of $\log n+2$, leaving open the question of whether the problem is NP-hard on general graphs

On multiple and infinite log-concavity (Luis A. Medina - 7 May, 2014)
Following Boros--Moll, a sequence $(a_n)$ is $m$-log-concave if $\mathcal{L}^j (a_n) \geq 0$ for all $j = 0, 1, \ldots, m$. Here, $\mathcal{L}$ is the operator defined by $\mathcal{L} (a_n) = a_n^2 - a_{n - 1} a_{n + 1}$. By a criterion of Craven--Csordas and McNamara--Sagan it is known that a sequence is $\infty$-log-concave if it satisfies the stronger inequality $a_k^2 \geq r a_{k - 1} a_{k + 1}$ for large enough $r$

Multiband processing of multimode light: combining 3D photonic lanterns with waveguide Bragg gratings (Izabela Spaleniak - 3 November, 2013)

Transmission dips of up to 5 dB were measured in both photonic lanterns and reference single-mode waveguides with 10.4-mm-long gratings

Deciding Monotone Duality and Identifying Frequent Itemsets in Quadratic Logspace (Georg Gottlob - 22 August, 2013)

A new lower bound based on Gromov's method of selecting heavily covered points (Daniel Kral - 21 March, 2012)
Boros and Furedi (for d=2) and Barany (for abritrary d) proved that there exists a positive real number c_d such that for every set P of n points in R^d in general position, there exists a point of R^d contained in at least c_d n!/(d+1)!(n-d-1)! d-simplices with vertices at the points of P. In particular, we improve the lower bound on c_3 from 0.06332 to more than 0.07480; the best upper bound known on c_3 being 0.09375.

The Reverse Ultra Log-Concavity of the Boros-Moll Polynomials (William Y. C. Chen - 24 April, 2009)

We propose two conjectures on the log-concavity and reverse ultra log-concavity of the sequence $\{d_{i-1}(m) d_{i+1}(m)/d_i(m)^2\}$ for $m\geq 2$.

Implication of W-boson Charge Asymmetry Measurements in p-pbar Collisions for Models of Charge Symmetry Violations in Parton Distributions (A. Bodek - 31 July, 1999)
A surprisingly large charge symmetry violation of the sea quarks in the nucleon has been proposed in a recent article by Boros et al. We show that these models are ruled out by the published CDF W charge asymmetry measurements, which strongly constrain the ratio of d and u quark momentum distributions in the proton over the x range of 0.006 to 0.34
