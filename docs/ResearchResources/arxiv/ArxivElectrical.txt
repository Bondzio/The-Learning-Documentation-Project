Rapid Fading Due to Human Blockage in Pedestrian Crowds at 5G Millimeter-Wave Frequencies (George R. MacCartney Jr. - 7 November, 2017)
Rapidly fading channels caused by pedestrians in dense urban environments will have a significant impact on millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications systems that employ electrically-steerable and narrow beamwidth antenna arrays. A peer-to-peer (P2P) measurement campaign was conducted with 7-degree, 15-degree, and 60-degree half-power beamwidth (HPBW) antenna pairs at 73.5 GHz and with 1 GHz of RF null-to-null bandwidth in a heavily populated open square scenario in Brooklyn, New York, to study blockage events caused by typical pedestrian traffic. Transition probability rates are determined from the measurements and it is shown that average fade durations with a -5 dB threshold are 299.0 ms for 7-degree HPBW antennas and 260.2 ms for 60-degree HPBW antennas. The four-state piecewise linear modeling approach shows that signal strength decay and rise times are asymmetric for blockage events and that mean signal attenuations (average fade depths) are inversely proportional to antenna HPBW, where 7-degree and 60-degree HPBW antennas resulted in mean signal fades of 15.8 dB and 11.5 dB, respectively

Our results show that the proposed CCA can achieve about 11% cooling cost saving on the simulation platform compared with a manually configured baseline control algorithm. Even though with DUE the results are conservative, we can still achieve about 15% cooling energy saving on the NSCC data trace if we set the inlet temperature threshold at 26.6 degree Celsius.

The proposed processing units can operate at speeds of at least $20$ MHz with fully asynchronous activity, light-speed-limited latency, and power densities on the order of 1 mW/cm$^2$ for neurons with 700 connections operating at full speed at 2 K. The processing units achieve an energy efficiency of $\approx 20$ aJ per synapse event. By leveraging multilayer photonics with deposited waveguides and superconductors with feature sizes $>$ 100 nm, this approach could scale to systems with massive interconnectivity and complexity for advanced computing as well as explorations of information processing capacity in systems with an enormous number of information-bearing microstates.

However, configurations exist for which convergence is possible within five to ten communication steps and, when just 30% of the nodes are DGs, the aggregate power demand is roughly halved.

Power Strip Packing of Malleable Demands in Smart Grid (Mohammad M. Karbasioun - 15 February, 2013)
Each customer requires a certain amount of electrical energy which has to be supplied during the time interval $[0,1]$. If it does - then an optimal assignment almost perfectly "fills" the rectangle $time \times power = [0,1] \times [0, A]$ with $A$ being the sum of all the energy demands - thus achieving an optimal power peak $A$. Conversely, if $\ell, r$ do not belong to $\mathcal{G}$, we identify the lower bound $\bar{A} >A$ on the optimal value of power peak and introduce a simple linear time algorithm that almost perfectly arranges all the demands in a rectangle $[0, A /\bar{A}] \times [0, \bar{A}]$ and show that it is asymptotically optimal.

Load Balancing with Reduced Unnecessary Handoff in Energy Efficient Macro/Femto-cell based BWA Networks (Prasun Chowdhury - 11 July, 2012)
However, this new technology introduces increased number of macro/femto handoff and wastage of electrical energy which in turn may affect the system performance.
