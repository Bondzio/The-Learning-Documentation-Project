Shape of the Cloak: Formal Analysis of Clock Skew-Based Intrusion Detection System in Controller Area Networks (Xuhang Ying - 25 July, 2018)
This paper presents a new masquerade attack called the cloaking attack and provides formal analyses for clock skew-based Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) that detect masquerade attacks in the Controller Area Network (CAN) in automobiles. By comparing each predicted attack success probability curve against its experimental curve, we find that the average prediction error is within 3.0% for the SOTA IDS and 5.7% for the NTP-based IDS.

Drive2Vec: Multiscale State-Space Embedding of Vehicular Sensor Data (David Hallac - 12 June, 2018)
It accepts a short interval of automobile sensor data as input and computes a low-dimensional representation of that data, which can then be used to accurately solve a range of tasks. We show in several experiments that our method outperforms other baselines by up to 90%, and we further demonstrate how these embeddings of sensor data can be used to solve a variety of real-world automotive applications.

Mapping Road Lanes Using Laser Remission and Deep Neural Networks (Raphael V. Carneiro - 27 April, 2018)
Our road grid maps contain all information about the roads' lanes required for building the Road Definition Data Files (RDDFs) that are necessary for the operation of our autonomous car, IARA (Intelligent Autonomous Robotic Automobile). After being trained, ENet achieved an average segmentation accuracy of 83.7%. We have tested the use of inferred road grid maps in the real world using IARA on a stretch of 3.7 km of urban roads and it has shown performance equivalent to that of the previous IARA's subsystem that uses a manually generated RDDF.

Using STPA in Compliance with ISO 26262 for Developing a Safe Architecture for Fully Automated Vehicles (Asim Abdulkhaleq - 10 March, 2017)
Safety has become of paramount importance in the development lifecycle of the modern automobile systems. However, the current automotive safety standard ISO 26262 does not specify clearly the methods for safety analysis. FTA (Fault Tree Analysis) and FMEA (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) are used in the most recent ISO 26262 applications to identify component failures, errors and faults that lead to specific hazards (in the presence of faults). In this paper, we present a concept on how to use STPA to extend the safety scope of ISO 26262 and support the Hazard Analysis and Risk Assessments (HARA) process. As a result, we identified 24 system- level accidents, 176 hazards, 27 unsafe control actions, and 129 unsafe scenarios

Using Deep Learning and Google Street View to Estimate the Demographic Makeup of the US (Timnit Gebru - 2 March, 2017)
Data from this census of motor vehicles, which enumerated 22M automobiles in total (8% of all automobiles in the US), was used to accurately estimate income, race, education, and voting patterns, with single-precinct resolution. (The average US precinct contains approximately 1000 people.) The resulting associations are surprisingly simple and powerful. For instance, if the number of sedans encountered during a 15-minute drive through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely to vote for a Democrat during the next Presidential election (88% chance); otherwise, it is likely to vote Republican (82%)

Autoencoder Regularized Network For Driving Style Representation Learning (Weishan Dong - 5 January, 2017)

Experiments on a challenging driver number estimation problem and the driver identification problem show that ARNet can learn a good generalized driving style representation: It significantly outperforms existing methods and alternative architectures by reaching the least estimation error on average (0.68, less than one driver) and the highest identification accuracy (by at least 3% improvement) compared with traditional supervised learning methods.

A Model-Predictive Motion Planner for the IARA Autonomous Car (Vinicius Cardoso - 9 November, 2017)

Using this path, the current position, a goal in the path and a map, IARA's MPMP is able to compute smooth trajectories from its current position to the goal in less than 50 ms. Our experiments have shown that MPMP is able to compute trajectories that precisely follow a path produced by a Human driver (distance of 0.15 m in average) while smoothly driving IARA at speeds of up to 32.4 km/h (9 m/s).
