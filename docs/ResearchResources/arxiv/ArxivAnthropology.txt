A Human-Centered Approach to Data Privacy : Political Economy, Power, and Collective Data Subjects (Meg Young - 28 May, 2016)
Drawing on work from theorists in sociocultural anthropology, I propose that a Human Centered Data Science move beyond concepts like dataset identifiability and sensitivity toward a broader ontology of who is implicated by a dataset, and new ways of anticipating how data can be combined and used.

Visualising Emotional Landmarks in Cities (Salvatore Iaconesi - 17 December, 2014)
In this paper we will present a series of these types of visualizations, and the ways in which they can be used to gain better understandings of these emotional patterns as they arise, from points of view which derive from anthropology, urbanism, sociology, politics and also arts and poetics. A reflection on possible usage cases for anthropology, urbanism, policy-making, arts and design will end the contribution, as well as the description of series of open issues and the indication of possible next-steps for research.

Algorithms for Junctions in Directed Acyclic Graphs (Carlos Eduardo Ferreira - 13 April, 2012)
Given a directed acyclic graph G and a vertex s in G, how can we find all pairs of vertices of G such that s is a junction of them? And given a directed acyclic graph G and k pairs of vertices of G, how can we preprocess G such that all junctions of k given pairs of vertices could be listed quickly? All junctions of k pairs problem arises in an application in Anthropology and we apply our algorithm to find such junctions on kinship networks of some brazilian indian ethnic groups.
