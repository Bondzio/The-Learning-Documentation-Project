Early Warnings of Cyber Threats in Online Discussions (Anna Sapienza - 29 January, 2018)
Our system leverages the communication of malicious actors on the darkweb, as well as activity of cyber security experts on social media platforms like Twitter. In a time period between September, 2016 and January, 2017, our method generated 661 alerts of which about 84% were relevant to current or imminent cyber-threats. Our analysis is enriched by two case studies: the first shows how the method could predict DDoS attacks, and how it would have allowed organizations to prepare for the Mirai attacks that caused widespread disruption in October 2016
