Reconstructing Faces from fMRI Patterns using Deep Generative Neural Networks (Rufin VanRullen - 9 October, 2018)
While objects from different categories can be reliably decoded from fMRI brain response patterns, it has proved more difficult to distinguish visually similar inputs, such as different instances of the same category. We then presented several thousand face images to human subjects, and learned a simple linear mapping between the multi-voxel fMRI activation patterns and the 1024 latent dimensions. Qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the reconstructions revealed robust pairwise decoding (>95% correct), and a strong improvement relative to a baseline model (PCA decomposition)

Continuous Learning of Context-dependent Processing in Neural Networks (Guanxiong Zeng - 5 October, 2018)

Exclusive Independent Probability Estimation using Deep 3D Fully Convolutional DenseNets for IsoIntense Infant Brain MRI Segmentation (Seyed Raein Hashemi - 27 September, 2018)
Infant brain MRI tissue segmentation is a complex deep learning task, where the white matter and gray matter of the developing brain at about 6 months of age show similar T1 and T2 relaxation times, having similar intensity values on both T1 and T2-weighted MRIs. By taking advantage of these strategies we were able to perform fast image segmentation, using a network with less parameters than many state-of-the-art networks, being image size independent overcoming issues such as 3D vs 2D training and large vs small patch size selection, while achieving the top performance in segmenting brain tissue among all methods in the 2017 iSeg challenge

Dynamically Weighted Ensemble-based Prediction System for Adaptively Modeling Driver Reaction Time (Chun-Hsiang Chuang - 18 September, 2018)
Factors such as fatigue, inattention and stress can induce homeostatic changes in the brain, which affect the observed relationship between brain dynamics and behavioral performance, and thus make the existing systems for predicting RT difficult to generalize. To obtain a final prediction, the prediction outcomes of the sub-models are then multiplied by weights that are derived from the EEG alpha coherences of 10 channels plus theta band powers of 30 channels, whose changes were found to be indicators of variations in the EEG-RT relationship

Extraction of SSVEPs-based Inherent Fuzzy Entropy Using a Wearable Headband EEG in Migraine Patients (Zehong Cao - 20 September, 2018)
Inherent fuzzy entropy is an objective measurement of electroencephalography (EEG) complexity, reflecting the robustness of brain systems. We used a wearable headband EEG device with O1, Oz, O2 and Fpz electrodes to collect EEG signals from 80 participants (40 migraine patients and 40 healthy controls [HCs]) under the following two conditions: during resting state and SSVEPs with five 15-Hz photic stimuli. In the 1st SSVEP , occipital EEG entropy of the HCs was significantly higher than that of patents in the pre-ictal phase (FDR-adjusted p < 0.05). Regarding the transitional variance of EEG entropy between the 1st and 5th SSVEPs, patients in the pre-ictal phase exhibited significantly lower values than patients in the inter-ictal phase (FDR-adjusted p < 0.05). Furthermore, in the classification model, the AdaBoost ensemble learning showed an accuracy of 81% and AUC of 0.87 for classifying inter-ictal and pre-ictal phases

Online classification of imagined speech using functional near-infrared spectroscopy signals (Alborz Rezazadeh Sereshkeh - 2 September, 2018)

In this paper, a 3-class intuitive BCI is presented which enables users to directly answer yes or no questions by covertly rehearsing the word 'yes' or 'no' for 15 s. Twelve participants each completed one offline block and six online blocks over the course of 2 sessions.

Spatially Localized Atlas Network Tiles Enables 3D Whole Brain Segmentation from Limited Data (Yuankai Huo - 5 June, 2018)

Development and validation of a novel dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) score based on metabolism FDG-PET imaging (Karteek Popuri - 2 November, 2017)
Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging based 3D topographic brain glucose metabolism patterns from normal controls (NC) and individuals with dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) are used to train a novel multi-scale ensemble classification model. This ensemble model outputs a FDG-PET DAT score (FPDS) between 0 and 1 denoting the probability of a subject to be clinically diagnosed with DAT based on their metabolism profile. A novel 7 group image stratification scheme is devised that groups images not only based on their associated clinical diagnosis but also on past and future trajectories of the clinical diagnoses, yielding a more continuous representation of the different stages of DAT spectrum that mimics a real-world clinical setting. The potential for using FPDS as a DAT biomarker was validated on a large number of FDG-PET images (N=2984) obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database taken across the proposed stratification, and a good classification AUC (area under the curve) of 0.78 was achieved in distinguishing between images belonging to subjects on a DAT trajectory and those images taken from subjects not progressing to a DAT diagnosis. Further, the FPDS biomarker achieved state-of-the-art performance on the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to DAT conversion prediction task with an AUC of 0.81, 0.80, 0.77 for the 2, 3, 5 years to conversion windows respectively.

We trained the networks with manual brain masks on 250 stacks of training images, and tested on 17 stacks of normal fetal brain images as well as 18 stacks of extremely challenging cases based on extreme motion, noise, and severely abnormal brain shape. Experimental results show that our U-net approach outperformed the other methods and achieved average Dice metrics of 96.52% and 78.83% in the normal and challenging test sets, respectively.

EEG-based Intention Recognition from Spatio-Temporal Representations via Cascade and Parallel Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (Dalin Zhang - 22 August, 2017)
Despite the extensive research of MI-EEG in recent years, it is still challenging to interpret EEG signals effectively due to the massive noises in EEG signals (e.g., low signal noise ratio and incomplete EEG signals), and difficulties in capturing the inconspicuous relationships between EEG signals and certain brain activities. Extensive experiments on a large-scale MI-EEG dataset (108 subjects, 3,145,160 EEG records) have demonstrated that both models achieve high accuracy near 98.3% and outperform a set of baseline methods and most recent deep learning based EEG recognition models, yielding a significant accuracy increase of 18% in the cross-subject validation scenario.

In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable architecture for brain tumor semantic segmentation through conditional adversarial training. We exploit conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) and train a semantic segmentation Convolution Neural Network (CNN) along with an adversarial network that discriminates segmentation maps coming from the ground truth or from the segmentation network for BraTS 2017 segmentation task[15, 4, 2, 3]. We also propose an end-to-end trainable CNN for survival day prediction based on deep learning techniques for BraTS 2017 prediction task [15, 4, 2, 3]. The proposed model achieves on validation data a DICE score, Sensitivity and Specificity respectively 0.68, 0.99 and 0.98 for the whole tumor, regarding online judgment system.

Automatic segmentation of the intracranialvolume in fetal MR images (N. Khalili - 31 July, 2017)
Quantitative analysis of fetal brain development requires automatic brain tissue segmentation that is typically preceded by segmentation of the intracranial volume (ICV). The method is developed and evaluated with 30 fetal T2-weighted MRI scans (average age $33.2\pm1.2$ weeks postmenstrual age). The set contains $10$ scans acquired in axial, $10$ in coronal and $10$ in sagittal imaging planes. A reference standard was defined in all images by manual annotation of the intracranial volume in $10$ equidistantly distributed slices. On average, the automatic method achieved Dice coefficients of 0.90 for the axial images, 0.90 for the coronal images and 0.92 for the sagittal images. Combining the training sets resulted in average Dice coefficients of 0.91 for the axial images, 0.95 for the coronal images, and 0.92 for the sagittal images

Applying advanced machine learning models to classify electro-physiological activity of human brain for use in biometric identification (Iaroslav Omelianenko - 3 August, 2017)
We will look at how the various characteristics of visual stimulation affect the measured electro-physiological response of the brain and describe the optimal parameters found that elicit a steady-state visually evoked potential (SSVEP) in certain parts of the cerebral cortex where it can be reliably perceived by the electrode of the EEG device. After that, we continue with a description of the advanced machine learning pipeline model that can perform confident classification of the collected EEG data in order to (a) reliably distinguish signal from noise (about 85% validation score) and (b) reliably distinguish between EEG records collected from different human participants (about 80% validation score). Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed method works reliably even with an inexpensive (less than $100) consumer-grade EEG sensing device and with participants who do not have previous experience with EEG technology (EEG illiterate)

Detection of bimanual gestures everywhere: why it matters, what we need and what is missing (Divya Shah - 9 July, 2017)
It assumes the availability of inertial data originating from the two hands/arms, builds upon a previously developed technique for gesture modelling based on Gaussian Mixture Modelling (GMM) and Gaussian Mixture Regression (GMR), and compares different modelling and classification techniques, which are based on a number of assumptions inspired by literature about how bimanual gestures are represented and modelled in the brain. Experiments show results related to 5 everyday bimanual activities, which have been selected on the basis of three main parameters: (not) constraining the two hands by a physical tool, (not) requiring a specific sequence of single-hand gestures, being recursive (or not). In the best performing combination of modeling approach and classification technique, five out of five activities are recognized up to an accuracy of 97%, a precision of 82% and a level of recall of 100%.

Continuous use of ERP-based BCIs with different visual angles in ALS patients (Jing Jin - 27 June, 2017)
Brain computer interfaces (BCIs) can establish a communication channel directly between the brain and an external device by recognizing brain activities that reflect user intent. Methods: In this paper, two kinds of ERP-based speller systems were tested on 18 ALS patients to: (1) assess performance when they spelled 42 characters online continuously, without a break; and (2) to compare performance between a matrix-based speller paradigm (MS-P, mean visual angle 6 degree) and a new speller paradigm that used a larger visual angle called the large visual angle speller paradigm (LS-P, mean visual angle 8 degree). Results: Although results showed that there were no significant differences between the two paradigms in accuracy trend over continuous use (p>0.05), the fatigue during the LS-P condition was significantly lower than that of MS-P (p<0.05). Conclusion: 15 subjects obtained higher than 80% feedback accuracy (online output accuracy) and 9 subjects obtained higher than 90% feedback accuracy in one of the two paradigms, thus validating the BCI approaches in this study

Semi-supervised Learning using Denoising Autoencoders for Brain Lesion Detection and Segmentation (Varghese Alex - 9 January, 2017)
The work presented explores the use of denoising autoencoders (DAE) for brain lesion detection, segmentation and false positive reduction. Stacked denoising autoencoders (SDAE) were pre-trained using a large number of unlabeled patient volumes and fine tuned with patches drawn from a limited number of patients (n=20, 40, 65). The results show negligible loss in performance even when SDAE was fine tuned using 20 patients. The weakly supervised SDAE (for HGG) and transfer learning based LGG network were also shown to generalize well and provide good segmentation on unseen BraTS 2013 & BraTS 2015 test data

Further, we lay out the different levels at which neural reuse can occur through a dynamical filtering of the brain-body-environment system's operation: structural network, autonomous dynamics, and transient dynamics. Notably, transient dynamics reuse could only be explained by studying the brain-body-environment system as a whole and not just the brain

Describing Semantic Representations of Brain Activity Evoked by Visual Stimuli (Eri Matsuo - 19 January, 2018)
The results demonstrate that the proposed model can decode brain activity and generate descriptions using natural language sentences. We also conducted several experiments with data from different subsets of brain regions known to process visual stimuli
