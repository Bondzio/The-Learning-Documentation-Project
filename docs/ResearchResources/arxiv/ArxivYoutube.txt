EventNet Version 1.1 Technical Report (Dongang Wang - 11 September, 2016)
In order to improve the quality of the current EventNet, we conduct the following steps and introduce EventNet version 1.1: (1) manually verify the correctness of event labels for all videos; (2) remove the YouTube user bias by limiting the maximum number of videos in each event from the same YouTube user as 3; (3) remove the videos which are currently not accessible online; (4) remove the video belonging to multiple event categories. After the above procedure, some events may contain only a small number of videos, and therefore we crawl more videos for those events to ensure every event will contain more than 50 videos. Finally, EventNet version 1.1 contains 67,641 videos, 500 events, and 5,028 event-specific concepts. In addition, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for event classification via fine-tuning AlexNet using EventNet version 1.1

While most of the videos in the "Most recent" feed are never popular, some 20% of them have distributions of attention metrics and measures of entropy that are similar to distributions for "Trending videos". We analyze how the 20% of "Most recent" videos that become somewhat popular differ from the 80% that do not, then compare these popular "Most recent" videos to different subsets of "Trending videos" to try to characterize and compare the attention each receives.

The application or employment of Gaussian mixture models for monitoring & Analysing speaker identity is encouraged by the familiarity, awareness, or understanding gained through experience that Gaussian spectrum depict the characteristics of speaker's spectral conformational pattern and remarkable ability of GMM to construct capricious densities after that we illustrate 'Expectation maximization' an iterative algorithm which takes some arbitrary value in initial estimation and carry on the iterative process until the convergence of value is observed,so by doing various number of experiments we are able to obtain 79 ~ 82% of identification rate using Vector quantization and 85 ~ 92.6% of identification rate using GMM modeling by Expectation maximization parameter estimation depending on variation of parameter.

(ii) Are deeper datasets better than wider datasets? (iii) Does adding label noise lead to improvement in performance of deep networks? (iv) Is alignment needed for face recognition? We address these questions by training CNNs using CASIA-WebFace, UMDFaces, and a new video dataset and testing on YouTube- Faces, IJB-A and a disjoint portion of UMDFaces datasets

We evaluated our learning-based QoE prediction model on the recently designed LIVE-Netflix Video QoE Database which consists of practical playout patterns, where the videos are afflicted by both quality changes and rebuffering events, and found that it provides improved performance over state-of-the-art video quality metrics while generalizing well on different datasets

Revisit Behavior in Social Media: The Phoenix-R Model and Discoveries (Flavio Figueiredo - 22 June, 2014)
Using four datasets of social activity, with up to tens of millions media objects (e.g., YouTube videos, Twitter hashtags or LastFM artists), we show the effect of revisits in the popularity evolution of such objects. Phoenix-R has the desired properties of being: (1) parsimonious, being based on the minimum description length principle, and achieving lower root mean squared error than state-of-the-art baselines; (2) applicable, the model is effective for predicting future popularity values of objects.
