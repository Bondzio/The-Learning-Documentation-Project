Rate-Accuracy Trade-Off In Video Classification With Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (Mohammad Jubran - 27 September, 2018)
However, when considering visual Internet-of-Things applications, surveillance systems and semantic crawlers of large video repositories, the video capture and the CNN-based semantic analysis parts do not tend to be co-located. Based on three CNN architectures and two action recognition datasets, we achieve 11%-94% saving in bitrate with marginal effect on classification accuracy. A model-based selection between multiple CNNs increases these savings further, to the point where, if up to 7% loss of accuracy can be tolerated, video classification can take place with as little as 3 kbps for the transport of the required compressed video information to the system implementing the CNN models.

In April 2017, all Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) confirmed that IPv4 addresses are exhausted and cannot be allocated anymore implying any new organization requesting a block of Internet addresses will be allocated IPv6. Currently, when IPv4 is not available, and IPv6 is not adopted for around 20 years, the question arises whether IPv6 will still be accepted by the computer society or will it have an end of life soon with alternate better protocol such as ID based networks taking its place

How much information remains? For example, how confident can we be that more people prefer item A to item B if item A had hundreds of upvotes on Reddit and item B had only a few? We investigate using an Internet game called GuessTheKarma that collects independent preference judgments (N=20,674) for 400 pairs of images, approximately 50 per pair. Overall, Reddit scores were not very good predictors of the true population preferences for items as measured by GuessTheKarma: the image with higher score was preferred by a majority of independent raters only 68% of the time. However, when one image had a low score and the other was one of the highest scoring in its subreddit, the higher scoring image was preferred nearly 90% of the time by the majority of independent raters

Low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies are gaining momentum for internet-of-things (IoT) applications since they promise wide coverage to a massive number of battery-operated devices using grant-free medium access. Results show that, for a duty cycle as low as 0.33%, the network performance under co-SF interference alone is considerably optimistic as the inclusion of inter-SF interference unveils a further drop in the success probability and the coverage probability of approximately 10% and 15%, respectively for 1500 devices in a LoRa channel

Differential Evolution Algorithm Aided Turbo Channel Estimation and Multi-User Detection for G.Fast Systems in the Presence of FEXT (Jiankang Zhang - 15 June, 2018)
The ever-increasing demand for broadband Internet access has motivated the further development of the digital subscriber line to the G.fast standard in order to expand its operational band from 106 MHz to 212 MHz. In this paper, we propose a novel differential evolution algorithm (DEA) aided turbo channel estimation (CE) and multi-user detection (MUD) scheme for the G.fast upstream including the frequency band up to 212 MHz, which is capable of approaching the optimal Cramer-Rao lower bound of the channel estimate, whilst approaching the optimal maximum likelihood (ML) MUD's performance associated with perfect channel state information, and yet only imposing about 5% of its computational complexity. Our extensive simulations show that 18 dB normalized mean square error gain is attained by the channel estimator and 10 dB signal-to-noise ratio gain can be achieved by the MUD upon exploiting this iteration gain

The experiment results imply that the key advantages of adopting FPGAs for edge computing over GPUs are three-fold: 1) FPGAs can provide a consistent throughput invariant to the size of application workload, which is critical to aggregating individual service requests from various IoT sensors; (2) FPGAs offer both spatial and temporal parallelism at a fine granularity and a massive scale, which guarantees a consistently high performance for accelerating both high-concurrency and high-dependency algorithms; and (3) FPGAs feature 3-4 times lower power consumption and up to 30.7 times better energy efficiency, offering better thermal stability and lower energy cost per functionality.

Promises and Caveats of Uplink IoT Ultra-Dense Networks (Ming Ding - 20 January, 2018)

In more detail, for a low-reliability criterion, such as achieving a UL signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) above 0 dB, the density of reliably working UEs grows quickly with the network densification, showing the potential of UL IoT UDNs. In contrast, for a high-reliability criterion, such as achieving a UL SINR above 10 dB, the density of reliably working UEs remains to be low in UDNs due to excessive inter-cell interference, which should be considered when operating UL IoT UDNs

A First Look at QUIC in the Wild (Jan RÃ¼th - 16 January, 2018)
For the first time since the establishment of TCP and UDP, the Internet transport layer is subject to a major change by the introduction of QUIC. Initiated by Google in 2012, QUIC provides a reliable, connection-oriented low-latency and fully encrypted transport. We monitor the entire IPv4 address space since August 2016 and about 46% of the DNS namespace to detected QUIC-capable infrastructures. Our scans show that the number of QUIC-capable IPs has more than tripled since then to over 617.59 K. We find QUIC to account for 2.6% to 9.1% of the current Internet traffic, depending on the vantage point. This share is dominated by Google pushing up to 42.1% of its traffic via QUIC.

Quantum attacks on Bitcoin, and how to protect against them (Divesh Aggarwal - 27 October, 2017)
The key cryptographic protocols used to secure the internet and financial transactions of today are all susceptible to attack by the development of a sufficiently large quantum computer. One particular area at risk are cryptocurrencies, a market currently worth over 150 billion USD. We find that the proof-of-work used by Bitcoin is relatively resistant to substantial speedup by quantum computers in the next 10 years, mainly because specialized ASIC miners are extremely fast compared to the estimated clock speed of near-term quantum computers. On the other hand, the elliptic curve signature scheme used by Bitcoin is much more at risk, and could be completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027, by the most optimistic estimates

We demonstrate RPL downward routing with loss rates in the order of 1e-5 in four different testbeds up to 352 nodes, in both sparse and dense settings. We also validate our solution on top of a low-power TSCH scheduler, and achieve sub-percent low duty cycles and a channel utilization of 0.07% at every node, spread over 16 channels.
