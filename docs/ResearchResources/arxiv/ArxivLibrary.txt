ECHO-3DHPC: Advance the performance of astrophysics simulations with code modernization (Matteo Bugli - 10 October, 2018)
With the help of the Intel Software Development Tools, like Fortran compiler and Profile-Guided Optimization (PGO), Intel MPI library, VTune Amplifier and Inspector we have investigated the performance issues and improved the application scalability and the time to solution. The node-level performance is improved by $2.3 \times$ and, thanks to the improved threading parallelisation, the hybrid MPI-OpenMP version of the code outperforms the MPI-only, thus lowering the MPI communication overhead.

Optimizing CNN Model Inference on CPUs (Yizhi Liu - 7 September, 2018)
The current approach to improving the performance of CNN model inference on CPUs relies on the use of a hardware-specific library of low-level operations such as Intel MKL-DNN and some basic model-level optimizations, which is restrictive and misses the opportunity to optimize the end-to-end inference pipeline as a whole. Experiments show that our solution achieves up to 2.81x better latency for CNN model inference on a 18-core Intel Platinum 8000-series CPU compared to the state-of-the-art implementations using Intel MKL-DNN.

We then show simulations of these machines using MATLAB running on a single core of a Xeon processor for several ILP benchmark problems taken from the MIPLIB 2010 library, and compare our results against a renowned commercial solver. In particular, we find within minutes feasible solutions for one of these hard problems (f2000 from MIPLIB 2010) whose feasibility, to the best of our knowledge, has remained unknown for the past eight years.

Vulnerable Open Source Dependencies: Counting Those That Matter (Ivan Pashchenko - 29 August, 2018)
Our analysis included 10905 distinct GAVs (group, artifact, version) when considering all the library versions. RESULTS: We found that about 20% of the dependencies affected by a known vulnerability are not deployed, and therefore, they do not represent a danger to the analyzed library because they cannot be exploited in practice. Developers of the analyzed libraries are able to fix (and actually responsible for) 82% of the deployed vulnerable dependencies. The vast majority (81%) of vulnerable dependencies may be fixed by simply updating to a new version, while 1% of the vulnerable dependencies in our sample are halted, and therefore, potentially require a costly mitigation strategy

Reassembling the English novel, 1789-1919 (Allen Riddell - 1 August, 2018)
The following are representative: How many writers made careers as novelists, Are there unacknowledged precursors or forgotten rivals to canonical authors, To what extent is a writer's critical or commercial success predictable from their social origins? In the last decade library digitization and the development of machine-readable datasets have improved the prospects for data-intensive literary history. This paper offers two analyses of bibliographic data concerning novels published in the British Isles after 1789. First, we estimate yearly rates of new novel publication between 1789 and 1919. Second, using titles of novels appearing between 1800 and 1829, we resolve a dispute concerning occupational gender segregation in novel subgenres. We show that the remarkable growth in the number of men novelists after 1815 was not concentrated in particular subgenres.

Experiments using 17,115 pull requests from 10 commercial projects and six open source projects show that our technique provides 85%--92% recommendation accuracy, about 86% precision and 79%--81% recall in code reviewer recommendation, which are highly promising

Unmixing urban hyperspectral imagery with a Gaussian mixture model on endmember variability (Yuan Zhou - 25 January, 2018)
The advantage of this algorithm is that the model size grows very slowly as a function of the library size. To validate this method, we used data collected by the AVIRIS sensor over the Santa Barbara region: two 16 m spatial resolution and two 4 m spatial resolution images. 64 validated regions of interest (ROI) (180 m by 180 m) were used to assess estimate accuracy. Ground truth was obtained using 1 m images leading to the following 6 classes: turfgrass, non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), paved, roof, soil, and tree. Spectral libraries were built by manually identifying and extracting pure spectra from both resolution images, resulting in 3,287 spectra at 16 m and 15,426 spectra at 4 m. The original libraries were used for the distribution-based algorithms whereas set-based methods required a sophisticated reduction method, resulting in reduced libraries of 61 spectra at 16 m and 95 spectra at 4 m

Fundamental Limits of Cloud and Cache-Aided Interference Management with Multi-Antenna Edge Nodes (Jingjing Zhang - 21 March, 2018)
In order to account for the cache capacity limitations at the Edge Nodes (ENs), transmission generally involves both fronthaul transfer from a cloud processor with access to the content library to the ENs, as well as wireless delivery from the ENs to the users. In this paper, the resulting problem is studied from an information-theoretic viewpoint by making the following practically relevant assumptions: 1) the ENs have multiple antennas; 2) only uncoded fractional caching is allowed; 3) the fronthaul links are used to send fractions of contents; and 4) the ENs are constrained to use one-shot linear precoding on the wireless channel. The characterization is exact for a subset of system parameters, and is generally optimal within a multiplicative factor of 3/2 for the serial case and of 2 for the pipelined case

Expect the unexpected: Harnessing Sentence Completion for Sarcasm Detection (Aditya Joshi - 19 July, 2017)
In order to obtain the expected word, we use Context2Vec, a sentence completion library based on Bidirectional LSTM. However, since the exact word where such an incongruity occurs may not be known in advance, we present two approaches: an All-words approach (which consults sentence completion for every content word) and an Incongruous words-only approach (which consults sentence completion for the 50% most incongruous content words)

Computer Self-efficacy and Its Relationship with Web Portal Usage: Evidence from the University of the East (Rex P. Bringula - 8 July, 2017)
E-learning services (M = 3.29) and online library resources (M = 3.12) were only used occasionally. Pearson correlation revealed that age was positively correlated with online library resources (r = 0.267, p < 0.05) and a negative relationship existed between perceived skill level in using the portal and online library resources usage (r = -0.206, p < 0.05). A 2x2 chi square revealed that the highest educational attainment had a significant relationship with online library resources (chi square = 5.489, df = 1, p < 0.05). Basic computer (r = 0.196, p < 0.05) and Internet skills (r = 0.303, p < 0.05) were significantly and positively related with e-learning services usage but not with online library resources usage

We evaluate the performance of MTNN on two modern GPUs: NVIDIA GTX 1080 and NVIDIA Titan X Pascal. MTNN can achieve 96\% of prediction accuracy with very low computational overhead, which results in an average of 54\% performance improvement on a range of NT operations.

Inspired and guided by the iRRAM C++ library (MÃ¼ller 2001), we formally specify a programming language for the paradigm of EXACT REAL COMPUTATION (ERC): reliably operating on encapsulated CONTINUOUS data types such as (not necessarily algebraic) real numbers -- imperatively and exactly (no rounding errors) with primitives COMPUTABLE in the sense of Recursive Analysis including a necessarily modified multivalued (=non-functional) semantics of tests

Generation of the Single Precision BLAS library for the Parallella platform, with Epiphany co-processor acceleration, using the BLIS framework (Miguel Tasende - 18 August, 2016)
In this paper an Epiphany-accelerated BLAS library for the Parallella platform was created (which could be suitable, also, for similar hybrid platforms that include the Epiphany chip as a coprocessor). There have been previous implementations of Matrix-Matrix multiplication, on this platform, that achieved very good performances inside the Epiphany chip (up to 85% of peak), but not so good ones for the complete Parallella platform (due to inter-chip data transfer bandwidth limitations)

As part of its 25th anniversary vision-setting process, the arXiv team at Cornell University Library conducted a user survey in April 2016 to seek input from the global user community about arXiv's current services and future directions. We were heartened to receive 36,000 responses from 127 countries, representing arXiv's diverse, global community. The prevailing message is that users are happy with the service as it currently stands, with 95 percent of survey respondents indicating they are very satisfied or satisfied with arXiv. Furthermore, 72 percent of respondents indicated that arXiv should continue to focus on its main purpose, which is to quickly make available scientific papers, and this will be enough to sustain the value of arXiv in the future

Feedback-Aided Coded Caching for the MISO BC with Small Caches (Jingjing Zhang - 16 June, 2016)
Building on the recently explored synergy between caching and delayed-CSIT, and building on the tradeoff between caching and CSIT quality, the work proposes new schemes that boost the impact of small caches, focusing on the case where the cumulative cache size is smaller than the library size. For this small-cache setting, based on the proposed near-optimal schemes, the work identifies the optimal cache-aided degrees-of-freedom (DoF) performance within a factor of 4.

We highly utilize the parallel primitives provided by the library Thrust such as the parallel segmented scan for better efficiency and simplicity. Experimental results indicate that: our implementation can achieve the speedups of up to 10.98x over the state-of-art CPU-based convex hull implementation Qhull [16]. In addition, our implementation can find the convex hull of 20M points in about 0.2 seconds.

Gradual refinement types, which support imprecise predicates that are optimistically interpreted, can be used in argument positions to constrain liquid inference so that the global inference process e effectively infers modular specifications usable for library components

An OpenGL and C++ based function library for curve and surface modeling in a large class of extended Chebyshev spaces (Ãgoston RÃ³th - 10 July, 2018)
Moreover, the library also implements methods that can be used to perform dimension elevation, to subdivide B-curves and B-surfaces by means of de Casteljau-like B-algorithms, and to generate basis transformations for the B-representation of arbitrary integral curves and surfaces that are described in traditional parametric form by means of the ordinary bases of the underlying EC spaces. Independently of the algebraic, exponential, trigonometric or mixed type of the applied EC space, the proposed library is numerically stable and efficient up to a reasonable dimension number and may be useful for academics and engineers in the fields of Approximation Theory, Computer Aided Geometric Design, Computer Graphics, Isogeometric and Numerical Analysis.
