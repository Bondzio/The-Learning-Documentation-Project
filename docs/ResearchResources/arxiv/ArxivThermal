A scalable parallel finite element framework for growing geometries. Application to metal additive manufacturing (Eric Neiva - 8 October, 2018)
Computational experiments consider the part-scale thermal analysis of the printing process by powder-bed technologies. After verification against a 3D benchmark, a strong scaling analysis is carried out for a simulation of 48 layers printed in a cuboid. The cuboid is adaptively meshed to model a layer-by-layer metal deposition process and the average global problem size amounts to 10.3 million unknowns. An unprecedented scalability for problems with growing domains is achieved, with the capability of simulating the printing and recoat of a single layer in 8 seconds average on 3,072 processors

Robust online identification of thermal models for in-production HPC clusters with machine learning-based data selection (Federico Pittino - 3 October, 2018)
In this paper we show that, using an advanced system identification algorithm, we are able to generate very accurate thermal models (average error lower than our sensors quantization step of 1Â°C) for a large scale HPC system on real workloads. However, we also show that: 1) not all real workloads allow for the identification of a good model; 2) starting from the theory of system identification it is very difficult to evaluate if a trace of data leads to a good estimated model. We also show that only via deep learning techniques these traces can be correctly chosen up to 96% of the times.

Validation of daylighting model in CODYRUN building simulation code (H. Boyer - 14 September, 2015)
Introduction Several software packages are available for thermal and airflow simulation in buildings. The most frequently used are ENERGY+ [1], ESP-r [2], and TRNSYS [3]. In the latter category, we may note ENERGY+, ESP-r and ECOTECT [4] software. After more than 20 years of developing a specific code named CODYRUN, we decided to add a lighting module to our software. Apart from the daylighting model, the majority applied the BESTEST procedure [15]. Associated with other specific comparisons, a very confident level of validation was obtained for the CODYRUN initial software [8].

In addition, relevant data selection method is computationally cheaper (around 8 minute training time) in contrast to whole data training (around 31 hour for weekend and 116 hour for working days) and reveals realistic control implementation for online system as well.

Joint source-channel coding via statistical mechanics: thermal equilibrium between the source and the channel (Neri Merhav - 13 October, 2008)
We examine the classical joint source--channel coding problem from the viewpoint of statistical physics and demonstrate that in the random coding regime, the posterior probability distribution of the source given the channel output is dominated by source sequences, which exhibit a behavior that is highly parallel to that of thermal equilibrium between two systems of particles that exchange energy, where one system corresponds to the source and the other corresponds to the channel. The thermodynamical entopies of the dual physical problem are analogous to conditional and unconditional Shannon entropies of the source, and so, their balance in thermal equilibrium yields a simple formula for the mutual information between the source and the channel output, that is induced by the typical code in an ensemble of joint source--channel codes under certain conditions
