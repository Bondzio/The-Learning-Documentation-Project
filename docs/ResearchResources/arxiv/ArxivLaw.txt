Multi-Stream Opportunistic Network Decoupling: Relay Selection and Interference Management (Huifa Lin - 8 October, 2018)
We propose a new achievable scheme operating with partial effective channel gain, termed multi-stream opportunistic network decoupling (MS-OND), which achieves the optimal degrees of freedom (DoF) under a certain relay scaling law. For interference management, each source node sends $S \,(1 \le S \le M)$ data streams to selected relay nodes with random beamforming for the first hop, while each destination node receives its desired $S$ streams from the selected relay nodes via opportunistic interference alignment for the second hop, where $M$ is the number of antennas at each source or destination node

Over-Optimization of Academic Publishing Metrics: Observing Goodhart's Law in Action (Michael Fire - 20 September, 2018)
Moreover, recent studies indicate that these metrics have become targets and follow Goodhart's Law, according to which "when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure." In this study, we analyzed over 120 million papers to examine how the academic publishing world has evolved over the last century. Moreover, by analyzing properties of over 2600 research fields, we observed that citation-based metrics are not beneficial for comparing researchers in different fields, or even in the same department

Generalized weak rigidity: Theory, and local and global convergence of formations (Seong-Ho Kwon - 7 September, 2018)
This paper discusses generalized weak rigidity, and aims to apply the theory to formation control problems with a gradient flow law in the $2$- and $3$-dimensional spaces. As the first result of its applications, the paper provides analysis of local stability for weakly rigid formation systems in the $2$- and $3$-dimensional spaces. Then, as the second result of its applications, if there are three agents in the $2$-dimensional space, almost globally exponential stabilization of weakly rigid formation systems is ensured

In this work, we pay particular attention to political false information as: 1) it can have dire consequences to the community (e.g., when election results are mutated) and 2) previous work show that this type of false information propagates faster and further when compared to other types of false information

We then study the edge-observability of a large real-world mobile phone dataset over a month and show that, even under the restricted two-hops rule, compromising as little as 1% of the nodes leads to observing up to 46% of all communications in the network. More worrisome, we also show that on average 36\% of each person's communications would be locally edge-observable under the same rule

Degradation of azimuthal gain by scattering was within 4 dB in the hallway and 7 dB inside a room with 90% probability. System simulations in a canonical building indicate that every hallway needs an access point to provide 1 Gbps rate in 90% of locations using 1 GHz of bandwidth.

Pruning is based on the power law weight-dependent Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP) model; synapses between pre- and post-neuron with high spike correlation are retained, whereas synapses with low correlation or uncorrelated spiking activity are pruned. The compressed topology achieved a classification accuracy of 90.1% (91.6%) on the MNIST (Caltech-101) dataset with 3.1x (2.2x) and 4x (2.6x) improvement in energy and area, respectively

On the Capacity of Face Representation (Sixue Gong - 15 February, 2018)
Face recognition is a widely used technology with numerous large-scale applications, such as surveillance, social media and law enforcement. Our experiments on unconstrained faces indicate that, (a) our proposed model yields a capacity upper bound of 5.8x$10^{8}$ for FaceNet and 1x$10^{0}$ for Eigenfaces at a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 1%, (b) the face representation capacity reduces drastically as you lower the desired FAR (for FaceNet; the capacity at FAR of 0.1% and 0.001% is 2.4x$10^{6}$ and 7.0x$10^{2}$, respectively), and (c) the empirical performance of FaceNet is significantly below the theoretical limit.

On the Capacity of Fractal Wireless Networks With Direct Social Interactions (Ying Chen - 26 May, 2017)

It is proved that if the source node communicates with one of its direct contacts randomly, the maximum capacity is consistent with the classical result $ Î\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n\log n}}\right) $ achieved by Kumar \cite{Gupta2000The}. On the other hand, if the two nodes with distance $ d $ communicate according to the probability $ d^{-Î²} $, the maximum capacity can reach up to $ Î\left(\frac{1}{\log n}\right) $, which exhibits remarkable improvement compared with the well-known result in \cite{Gupta2000The}.

Automated Latent Fingerprint Recognition (Kai Cao - 6 April, 2017)
Latent fingerprints are one of the most important and widely used evidence in law enforcement and forensic agencies worldwide. Experimental results show that the rank-1 identification accuracies (query latent is matched with its true mate in the reference database) are 64.7% for the NIST SD27 and 75.3% for the WVU latent databases, against a reference database of 100K rolled prints. These results are the best among published papers on latent recognition and competitive with the performance (66.7% and 70.8% rank-1 accuracies on NIST SD27 and WVU DB, respectively) of a leading COTS latent Automated Fingerprint Identification System (AFIS). By score-level (rank-level) fusion of our system with the commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) latent AFIS, the overall rank-1 identification performance can be improved from 64.7% and 75.3% to 73.3% (74.4%) and 76.6% (78.4%) on NIST SD27 and WVU latent databases, respectively.

Stochastic Timed Games Revisited (S Akshay - 19 July, 2016)
Stochastic timed games (STGs), introduced by Bouyer and Forejt, naturally generalize both continuous-time Markov chains and timed automata by providing a partition of the locations between those controlled by two players (Player Box and Player Diamond) with competing objectives and those governed by stochastic laws. Depending on the number of players---$2$, $1$, or $0$---subclasses of stochastic timed games are often classified as $2\frac{1}{2}$-player, $1\frac{1}{2}$-player, and $\frac{1}{2}$-player games where the $\frac{1}{2}$ symbolizes the presence of the stochastic "nature" player. For STGs with reachability objectives it is known that $1\frac{1}{2}$-player one-clock STGs are decidable for qualitative objectives, and that $2\frac{1}{2}$-player three-clock STGs are undecidable for quantitative reachability objectives. We show that quantitative reachability objectives are already undecidable for $1\frac{1}{2}$ player four-clock STGs, and even under the time-bounded restriction for $2\frac{1}{2}$-player five-clock STGs. We also obtain a class of $1\frac{1}{2}$, $2\frac{1}{2}$ player STGs for which the quantitative reachability problem is decidable.

Some reflections on directed lattice paths (Cyril Banderier - 5 May, 2016)

The full analytic situation is more complicated than the Banderier-Flajolet model (partly because new "critical compositions" appear, forcing us to introduce new key quantities, like the drift at 0), and we quantify to what extent the global drift, and the drift at 0 play a role in the "universal" behavior of such walks.

Are there too many uncited articles? Zero inflated variants of the discretised lognormal and hooked power law distributions (Mike Thelwall - 21 April, 2016)
Although statistical models fit many citation data sets reasonably well with the best fitting models being the hooked power law and discretised lognormal distribution, the fits are rarely close. Using data from 23 different Scopus categories, this article tests the assumption that removing a proportion of uncited articles from a citation dataset allows statistical distributions to have much closer fits. In all 23 cases, the zero inflated version of the discretised lognormal distribution was an improvement on the standard version and in 15 out of 23 cases the zero inflated version of the hooked power law was an improvement on the standard version. Without zero inflation the discretised lognormal models fit the data better than the hooked power law distribution 6 out of 23 times and with it, the discretised lognormal models fit the data better than the hooked power law distribution 9 out of 23 times

We cluster up to 123 million face images into over 10 million clusters, and analyze the results in terms of both external cluster quality measures (known face labels) and internal cluster quality measures (unknown face labels) and run-time. Our algorithm achieves an F-measure of 0.87 on a benchmark unconstrained face dataset (LFW, consisting of 13K faces), and 0.27 on the largest dataset considered (13K images in LFW, plus 123M distractor images). Additionally, we present preliminary work on video frame clustering (achieving 0.71 F-measure when clustering all frames in the benchmark YouTube Faces dataset)

For $Î²>2$ we show that for some $Îµ>0$, MAX-CUT is NP-hard to approximate within approximation ratio $1+Îµ$, ruling out the existence of a PTAS in this case. Moreover we give an approximation algorithm with improved constant approximation ratio for the case of $Î²>2$.

The number of articles published through collaboration account for 89%. The citation-based performance and collaboration patterns exhibit a power-law correlation with a scaling exponent of 1.20, SD=0.07. This means that the citations to a field research areas articles increase 2.30 times each time it doubles the number of collaborative papers. The scaling exponent for the power-law relationship for single-authored papers was 0.85, SD=0.11.

Will This Paper Increase Your h-index? Scientific Impact Prediction (Yuxiao Dong - 15 December, 2014)
The effectiveness of such predictions, however, is fundamentally limited by the power-law distribution of citations, whereby publications with few citations are extremely common and publications with many citations are relatively rare. Given this limitation, in this work we instead address a related question asked by many academic researchers in the course of writing a paper, namely: "Will this paper increase my h-index?" Using a real academic dataset with over 1.7 million authors, 2 million papers, and 8 million citation relationships from the premier online academic service ArnetMiner, we formalize a novel scientific impact prediction problem to examine several factors that can drive a paper to increase the primary author's h-index. By leveraging relevant factors, we find a greater than 87.5% potential predictability for whether a paper will contribute to an author's h-index within five years. As a further experiment, we generate a self-prediction for this paper, estimating that there is a 76% probability that it will contribute to the h-index of the co-author with the highest current h-index in five years

Randomized Rumor Spreading in Poorly Connected Small-World Networks (Abbas Mehrabian - 29 October, 2014)
We analyze this protocol on random $k$-trees, a class of power law graphs, which are small-world and have large clustering coefficients, built as follows: initially we have a $k$-clique. When $k>1$ is fixed, we show that if initially a random node is aware of the rumor, then with probability $1-o(1)$ after $O\left((\log n)^{1+2/k}\cdot\log\log n\cdot f(n)\right)$ rounds the rumor propagates to $n-o(n)$ nodes, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $f(n)$ is any slowly growing function. Our technique for proving the upper bound carries over to a closely related class of graphs, random $k$-Apollonian networks, for which we prove an upper bound of $O\left((\log n)^{c_k}\cdot\log\log n\cdot f(n)\right)$ rounds for informing $n-o(n)$ nodes with probability $1-o(1)$ when $k>2$ is fixed. Here, $c_k=(k^2-3)/(k-1)^2<1 + 2/k$.

We show that when $M$-QAM ($M >4$) signal set is used, the conventional XOR network mapping fails to remove the ill effects of $Î³e^{j Î¸}=1$, which is a singular fade state for all signal sets of arbitrary size

Power Control and Multiuser Diversity for the Distributed Cognitive Uplink (Ehsan Nekouei - 6 April, 2013)
The fading models considered to derive sum-rate scaling laws are general enough to include Rayleigh, Rician and Nakagami fading models as special cases. When transmissions of secondary users are limited by both transmission and interference power constraints, it is shown that the secondary network sum-rate scales according to $\frac{1}{\e{}n_h}\log\logp{N}$, where $n_h$ is a parameter obtained from the distribution of direct channel power gains. For the case of transmissions limited only by interference constraints, on the other hand, the secondary network sum-rate scales according to $\frac{1}{\e{}Î³_g}\logp{N}$, where $Î³_g$ is a parameter obtained from the distribution of interference channel power gains. These results indicate that the distributed cognitive uplink is able to achieve throughput scaling behavior similar to that of the centralized cognitive uplink up to a pre-log multiplier $\frac{1}{\e{}}$, whilst primary's quality-of-service requirements are met. The factor $\frac{1}{\e{}}$ can be interpreted as the cost of distributed implementation of the cognitive uplink.

We first consider the single antenna case with $K$ users, and derive that the EE scales as $\frac{\log_2 \ln K}Î±$ when $Î±> 0$ and $\log_2 K$ when $Î±= 0$, where $Î±$ is the normalized transmit independent power. The scaling law becomes $\frac{M \log_2 \ln NK}Î±$ when $Î±> 0$ and $ \log_2 NK$ when $Î±= 0$.

Information-Theoretic Capacity and Error Exponents of Stationary Point Processes under Random Additive Displacements (Venkat Anantharam - 22 December, 2010)
The decoding problem is then the following one: the whole mother point process is known as well as the coordinates of some daughter point; the displacements are only known through their law; can one find the mother of this daughter point? The Shannon regime is that where the dimension $n$ tends to infinity and where the logarithm of the intensity of the point process is proportional to $n$. We show that this problem exhibits a sharp threshold: if the sum of the proportionality factor and of the differential entropy rate of the noise is positive, then the probability of finding the right mother point tends to 0 with $n$ for all point processes and decoding strategies. If this sum is negative, there exist mother point processes, for instance Poisson, and decoding strategies, for instance maximum likelihood, for which the probability of finding the right mother tends to 1 with $n$. We then use large deviations theory to show that in the latter case, if the entropy spectrum of the noise satisfies a large deviation principle, then the error probability goes exponentially fast to 0 with an exponent that is given in closed form in terms of the rate function of the noise entropy spectrum

In a nutshell, we are able to show that as the sparsity backs off $\varpi$ ($0<\varpi<1$) from the weak threshold of $\ell_1$ recovery, the parameter for the recovery stability will scale as $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\varpi}}$. If the nonzero elements over the signal support follow an amplitude probability density function (pdf) $f(\cdot)$ whose $t$-th derivative $f^{t}(0) \neq 0$ for some integer $t \geq 0$, then a certain iterative reweighted $\ell_1$ minimization algorithm can be analytically shown to lift the phase transition thresholds (weak thresholds) of the plain $\ell_1$ minimization algorithm.

Fractal Weyl law for Linux Kernel Architecture (L. Ermann - 16 September, 2010)
Our results obtained for various versions of the Linux Kernel show that the spectrum is characterized by the fractal Weyl law established recently for systems of quantum chaotic scattering and the Perron-Frobenius operators of dynamical maps. The fractal Weyl exponent is found to be $Î½\approx 0.63$ that corresponds to the fractal dimension of the network $d \approx 1.2$. We argue that the fractal Weyl law should be generic for directed networks with the fractal dimension $d<2$.

This paper considers the relaxed version of the transport problem for general nonlinear control systems, where the objective is to design time-varying feedback laws that transport a given initial probability measure to a target probability measure under the action of the closed-loop system. To make the problem analytically tractable, we consider control laws that are stochastic, i.e., the control laws are maps from the state space of the control system to the space of probability measures on the set of admissible control inputs
