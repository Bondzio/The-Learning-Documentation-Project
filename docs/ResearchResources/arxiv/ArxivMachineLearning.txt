Baidu Apollo Auto-Calibration System - An Industry-Level Data-Driven and Learning based Vehicle Longitude Dynamic Calibrating Algorithm (Fan Zhu - 30 August, 2018)
Since manual calibration is not sustainable once entering into mass production stage for industrial purposes, we here introduce a machine-learning based auto-calibration system for autonomous driving vehicles. This longitudinal auto-calibration system has been deployed to more than one hundred Baidu Apollo self-driving vehicles (including hybrid family vehicles and electronic delivery-only vehicles) since April 2018. By August 27, 2018, it had been tested for more than two thousands hours, ten thousands kilometers (6,213 miles) and yet proven to be effective.

hep-th (Yang-Hui He - 27 June, 2018)
We apply techniques in natural language processing, computational linguistics, and machine-learning to investigate papers in hep-th and four related sections of the arXiv: hep-ph, hep-lat, gr-qc, and math-ph. All of the titles of papers in each of these sections, from the inception of the arXiv until the end of 2017, are extracted and treated as a corpus which we use to train the neural network Word2Vec. In conjunction with support vector machines, we also show that the syntactic structure of the titles in different sub-fields of high energy and mathematical physics are sufficiently different that a neural network can perform a binary classification of formal versus phenomenological sections with 87.1% accuracy, and can perform a finer five-fold classification across all sections with 65.1% accuracy.

Improving Network Intrusion Detection Classifiers by Non-payload-Based Exploit-Independent Obfuscations: An Adversarial Approach (Ivan Homoliak - 7 May, 2018)
Machine-learning based intrusion detection classifiers are able to detect unknown attacks, but at the same time, they may be susceptible to evasion by obfuscation techniques. Our experiments confirm the assumption that it is possible to evade the intrusion detection capability of all classifiers trained without prior knowledge about obfuscated attacks, causing an exacerbation of the TPR ranging from 7.8% to 66.8%. Further, when widening the training knowledge of the classifiers by a subset of obfuscated attacks, we achieve a significant improvement of the TPR by 4.21% - 73.3%, while the FPR is deteriorated only slightly (0.1% - 1.48%). Finally, we test the capability of an obfuscations-aware classifier to detect unknown obfuscated attacks, where we achieve over 90% detection rate on average for most of the obfuscations.

Results: The area under the curve (AUC) of MySurgeryRisk algorithm ranged between 0.73 and 0.85 and was significantly higher than physicians' risk assessments (AUC between 0.47 and 0.69) for all postoperative complications except cardiovascular complications. The AUC for repeated physician's risk assessment improved by 2% to 5% for all complications with the exception of thirty-day mortality. Physicians' risk assessment for acute kidney injury and intensive care unit admission longer than 48 hours significantly improved after knowledge exchange, resulting in net reclassification improvement of 12.4% and 16%, respectively

Fast and accurate classification of echocardiograms using deep learning (Ali Madani - 26 June, 2017)
Deep learning is a cutting-edge machine-learning technique that has been useful in analyzing medical images but has not yet been widely applied to echocardiography, partly due to the complexity of echocardiograms' multi view, multi modality format. To this end, we anonymized 834,267 transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) images from 267 patients (20 to 96 years, 51 percent female, 26 percent obese) seen between 2000 and 2017 and labeled them according to standard views. We built a multilayer convolutional neural network and used supervised learning to simultaneously classify 15 standard views. Eighty percent of data used was randomly chosen for training and 20 percent reserved for validation and testing on never seen echocardiograms. Using multiple images from each clip, the model classified among 12 video views with 97.8 percent overall test accuracy without overfitting. Even on single low resolution images, test accuracy among 15 views was 91.7 percent versus 70.2 to 83.5 percent for board-certified echocardiographers
