The Privacy Policy Landscape After the GDPR (Thomas Linden - 22 September, 2018)
We create a diverse corpus of 3,086 English-language privacy policies for which we fetch the pre-GPDR and the post-GDPR versions. Via a user study with 530 participants on Amazon Mturk, we discover that the visual presentation of privacy policies has slightly improved in limited data-sensitive categories in addition to the top European websites. We also find that the readability of privacy policies suffers under the GDPR, due to almost a 30% more sentences and words, despite the efforts to reduce the reliance on passive sentences. We find evidence for positive changes triggered by the GDPR, with the ambiguity level, averaged over 8 metrics, improving in over 20.5% of the policies. Finally, we show that privacy policies cover more data practices, particularly around data retention, user access rights, and specific audiences, and that an average of 15.2% of the policies improved across 8 compliance metrics

Bootstrapping Transliteration with Constrained Discovery for Low-Resource Languages (Shyam Upadhyay - 20 September, 2018)
Generating the English transliteration of a name written in a foreign script is an important and challenging step in multilingual knowledge acquisition and information extraction. Existing approaches to transliteration generation require a large (>5000) number of training examples. In this work, we present a bootstrapping algorithm that uses constrained discovery to improve generation, and can be used with as few as 500 training examples, which we show can be sourced from annotators in a matter of hours

Building a Unified Code-Switching ASR System for South African Languages (Emre YÄ±lmaz - 28 July, 2018)
Recently, we have compiled a small five-language corpus of South African soap opera speech which contains examples of CS between 5 languages occurring in various contexts such as using English as the matrix language and switching to other indigenous languages. The ASR system presented in this work is trained on 4 corpora containing English-isiZulu, English-isiXhosa, English-Setswana and English-Sesotho CS speech. The interpolation of multiple language models trained on these language pairs enables the ASR system to hypothesize mixed word sequences from these 5 languages

Clifford's attempt to test his gravitation hypothesis (S. Galindo - 24 July, 2018)
Almost half a century before Einstein expounded his general theory of relativity, the English mathematician William Kingdon Clifford argued that space might not be Euclidean and proposed that matter is nothing but a small distortion in that spatial curvature. For this purpose he made an unsuccessful observation on the change of the plane of polarization of the skylight during the solar eclipse of December 22, 1870 in Sicily.

Exact solution to an extremal problem on graphic sequences with a realization containing every $2$-tree on $k$ vertices (De-Yan Zeng - 2 July, 2018)
Yin and Li (Acta Mathematica Sinica, English Series, 25(2009)795--802) proved that if $k\ge 2$, $n\ge \frac{9}{2}k^2+\frac{19}{2}k$ and $Ï=(d_1,\ldots,d_n)$ is a graphic sequence with $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n d_i>(k-2)n$, then $Ï$ has a realization containing every 1-tree (the usual tree) on $k$ vertices. In this paper, we investigate an analogue problem for $2$-trees and prove that if $k\ge 3$ is an integer with $k\equiv i(\mbox{mod }3)$, $n\geq20\lfloor\frac{k}{3}\rfloor^2+31\lfloor\frac{k}{3}\rfloor+12$ and $Ï=(d_1,\ldots,d_n)$ is a graphic sequence with $\sum\limits_{i=1}^n d_i>\max\{(k-1)(n-1),2\lfloor\frac{2k}{3}\rfloor n-2n-\lfloor\frac{2k}{3}\rfloor^2+\lfloor\frac{2k}{3}\rfloor+1-(-1)^i\}$, then $Ï$ has a realization containing every 2-tree on $k$ vertices. Moreover, the lower bound $\max\{(k-1)(n-1),2\lfloor\frac{2k}{3}\rfloor n-2n-\lfloor\frac{2k}{3}\rfloor^2+\lfloor\frac{2k}{3}\rfloor+1-(-1)^i\}$ is the best possible. Sci., 17(3)(2016), 315--326).

Further, we demonstrate the utility of this corpus by training an automatic word importance labeling model; our best performing model has an F-score of 0.60 in an ordinal 6-class word-importance classification task with an agreement (concordance correlation coefficient) of 0.839 with the human annotators (agreement score between annotators is 0.89)

Empirical observations of ultraslow diffusion driven by the fractional dynamics in languages: Dynamical statistical properties of word counts of already popular words (Hayafumi Watanabe - 29 June, 2018)
In this paper, firstly, we find the ultraslow-like diffusion of the time-series of word counts of already popular words by analysing three different nationwide language databases: (i) newspaper articles (Japanese), (ii) blog articles (Japanese), and (iii) page views of Wikipedia (English, French, Chinese, and Japanese). Secondly, we use theoretical analysis to show that this diffusion is basically explained by the random walk model with the power-law forgetting with the exponent $Î²\approx 0.5$, which is related to the fractional Langevin equation. The exponent $Î²$ characterises the speed of forgetting and $Î²\approx 0.5$ corresponds to (i) the border (or thresholds) between the stationary and the nonstationary and (ii) the right-in-the-middle dynamics between the IID noise for $Î²=1$ and the normal random walk for $Î²=0$

What Level of Quality can Neural Machine Translation Attain on Literary Text? (Antonio Toral - 15 January, 2018)
We build a literary-adapted NMT system for the English-to-Catalan translation direction and evaluate it against a system pertaining to the previous dominant paradigm in MT: statistical phrase-based MT (PBSMT). To this end, for the first time we train MT systems, both NMT and PBSMT, on large amounts of literary text (over 100 million words) and evaluate them on a set of twelve widely known novels spanning from the the 1920s to the present day. According to the BLEU automatic evaluation metric, NMT is significantly better than PBSMT (p < 0.01) on all the novels considered. Overall, NMT results in a 11% relative improvement (3 points absolute) over PBSMT. A complementary human evaluation on three of the books shows that between 17% and 34% of the translations, depending on the book, produced by NMT (versus 8% and 20% with PBSMT) are perceived by native speakers of the target language to be of equivalent quality to translations produced by a professional human translator.

This method was applied with the CallHome training corpus and improved individual system performances by on average 6.1% (relative) against the CallHome portion of the evaluation set with no performance loss on the Switchboard portion. With RNN-LM rescoring and lattice combination on the 5 systems trained across three different phone sets, our 2017 speech recognition system has obtained 5.0% and 9.1% on Switchboard and CallHome, respectively, both of which are the best word error rates reported thus far. According to IBM in their latest work to compare human and machine transcriptions, our reported Switchboard word error rate can be considered to surpass the human parity (5.1%) of transcribing conversational telephone speech.

The Vocal Joystick Vowel Corpus, by Washington University, was used to study monophthongs pronounced by native English speakers. In particular, the phonemes /\textipa{@}/, /Ã¦/, /\textipa{A}:/ and /\textipa{2}/ were analysed. 748 sound files from the corpus were used and subjected to Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) to compute their formants, and to Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) algorithm, to compute the cepstral coefficients. A Decision Tree Classifier was used to build a predictive model that learnt the patterns of the two first formants measured in the data set, as well as the patterns of the 13 cepstral coefficients. An accuracy of 70\% was achieved using formants for the mentioned phonemes. For the MFCC analysis an accuracy of 52 \% was achieved and an accuracy of 71\% when /\textipa{@}/ was ignored

In this paper, we present Comprehensive EVent Ontology (CEVO), built on Levin's conceptual hierarchy of English verbs that categorizes verbs with shared meaning, and syntactic behavior. These use-cases demonstrate the benefits of using CEVO for annotation: (i) annotating English verbs from an abstract conceptualization, (ii) playing the role of an upper ontology for organizing ontological properties, and (iii) facilitating the annotation of text relations using any underlying vocabulary

Enhancing semantic expressivity in the cultural heritage domain: exposing the Zeri Photo Archive as Linked Open Data (Marilena Daquino - 12 February, 2017)
We describe here the steps we undertook to this end: firstly, we developed two ad hoc ontologies for describing all the issues not completely covered by existent models (the F Entry and the OA Entry Ontology); then we mapped into RDF the descriptive elements used in the current Zeri Photo Archive catalog, converting into CIDOC-CRM and into the two new aforementioned models the source data based on the Italian content standards Scheda F (Photography Entry, in English) and Scheda OA (Work of Art Entry, in English); and finally, we created an RDF dataset of the output of the mapping that could show a result capable of demonstrating the complexity of our scenario.

As the digital landscape broadens to accommodate more internet-enabled devices and technologies like social media, more cybercriminals who are not native English speakers are invading cyberspace to cash in on quick exploits. In this paper we evaluate the performance of three machine learning classifiers in detecting 419 scams in a bilingual Nigerian cybercriminal community. The preliminary results on a real world dataset reveal the SVM significantly outperforms NaÃ¯ve Bayes and IBK at 95% confidence level.

Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation (Minh-Thang Luong - 20 September, 2015)
We demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches over the WMT translation tasks between English and German in both directions. With local attention, we achieve a significant gain of 5.0 BLEU points over non-attentional systems which already incorporate known techniques such as dropout. Our ensemble model using different attention architectures has established a new state-of-the-art result in the WMT'15 English to German translation task with 25.9 BLEU points, an improvement of 1.0 BLEU points over the existing best system backed by NMT and an n-gram reranker.
