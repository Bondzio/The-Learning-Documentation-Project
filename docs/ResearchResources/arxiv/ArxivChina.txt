Effective Predictions of Gaokao Admission Scores for College Applications in Mainland China (Hao Zhang - 12 September, 2018)
Gaokao is the annual academic qualification examination for college admissions in mainland China. About 9.5 million high- school seniors participate in Gaokao every year, and the Gaokao scores are good for just one year. We show that our methods significantly outperform the methods commonly used by teachers and experts, and can predict admission scores with an accuracy of 91% within a 7-point margin in an exam of a 750-point grading scale.

For example, the current routers cost over 10.3 billion USD, so if DR at line speed requires all new hardware, the cost alone would make such a project unfeasible for most actors.

Simulation of Urban Expansion and Farmland Loss in China by Integrating Cellular Automata and Random Forest (Yao Yao - 16 May, 2017)
This study proposed a random forest algorithm (RFA) based cellular automata (CA) model to simulate China's urban expansion and farmland loss in a fine scale from 2000 to 2030. The objectives of this study are to 1) mine urban conversion rules in different homogeneous economic development regions, and 2) simulate China's urban expansion process and farmland loss at high spatial resolution (30 meters). This study proves that the primary factor of farmland loss in China is rapid urbanization from 2000, and the farmland loss rate is expected to slow down gradually and will stabilize from 2010 to 2030. It shows that China is able to preserve the 1.20 million km farmland without crossing the "red line" within the next 20 years, but the situation remains severe.

The Lifecycle and Cascade of WeChat Social Messaging Groups (Jiezhong Qiu - 20 February, 2016)
In this paper, we analyze the daily usage logs from WeChat group messaging platform - the largest standalone messaging communication service in China - with the goal of understanding the processes by which social messaging groups come together, grow new members, and evolve over time. By considering members' historical engagement behavior as well as the local social network structure that they embedded in, we develop a membership cascade model and demonstrate the effectiveness by achieving AUC of 95.31% in predicting inviter, and an AUC of 98.66% in predicting invitee.

Topical differences between Chinese language Twitter and Sina Weibo (Qian Zhang - 22 December, 2015)
In this study, we contrast the discussions occurring on Sina Weibo and on Chinese language Twitter in order to observe two different strands of Chinese culture: people within China who use Sina Weibo with its government imposed restrictions and those outside that are free to speak completely anonymously. Using a large corpus of Weibo and Chinese language tweets, covering the period from January $1$ to December $31$, $2012$, we obtain a list of topics using clustered \#tags that we can then use to compare the two platforms. Surprisingly, we find that there are no common entries among the Top $100$ most popular topics. Furthermore, only $9.2\%$ of tweets correspond to the Top $1000$ topics on Sina Weibo platform, and conversely only $4.4\%$ of weibos were found to discuss the most popular Twitter topics

We also attempted to disambiguate names that were shared by multiple government officers who served between 618 and 1912 and were recorded in Chinese local gazetteers. Similar approaches can be applied to the analysis and study of modern documents, such as the newspaper articles published about the 228 incident that occurred in 1947 in Taiwan.

Profiling underprivileged residents with mid-term public transit smartcard data of Beijing (Ying Long - 19 September, 2014)
Mobility of economically underprivileged residents in China has seldom been well profiled due to privacy issue and the characteristics of Chinese over poverty. In this paper, we identify and characterize underprivileged residents in Beijing using ubiquitous public transport smartcard transactions in 2008 and 2010, respectively. Our argument is tested against (1) the household travel survey in 2010, (2) a small-scale survey in 2012, as well as (3) our interviews with local residents in Beijing. Cardholders' job and residence locations are identified using Smart Card Data (SCD) in 2008 and 2010. We then classify all identified FRs into 20 groups by residence changes (change, no change), workplace changes (change, no change, finding a job, losing a job, and all-time employed) during 2008-2010 and housing place in 2010 (within the fourth ring road or not).

Dynamics of Trends and Attention in Chinese Social Media (Louis Lei Yu - 2 December, 2013)
We find that there is a vast difference in the content shared in China when compared to a global social network such as Twitter. In China, the trends are created almost entirely due to the retweets of media content such as jokes, images and videos, unlike Twitter where it has been shown that the trends tend to have more to do with current global events and news stories

Nation-State Routing: Censorship, Wiretapping, and BGP (Josh Karlin - 18 March, 2009)
For instance, how many countries rely on China or Great Britain (known traffic censors) to transit their traffic? These kinds of questions are surprisingly difficult to answer, as they require combining information collected at the prefix, Autonomous System, and country level, and grappling with incomplete knowledge about the AS-level topology and routing policies. Our results show that some countries known for their national policies, such as Iran and China, have relatively little effect on interdomain routing, while three countries (the United States, Great Britain, and Germany) are central to international reachability, and their policies thus have huge potential impact.

Product Cycle, Wintelism, and Cross-national Production Networks (CPN) for Developing Countries-- China's Telecom Manufacturing Industry as A Case (Zixiang Alex Tan - 21 September, 2001)
First, product cycle theory could be applied to explain multinational corporations' strategies of importing and localizing their products in China in order to take advantage of lower labor costs and often more significantly to break barriers to the Chinese market. Third, the success of "Wintelism" and the maturity of cross-national production networks in the global market have had significant impacts on China's indigenous industry.
