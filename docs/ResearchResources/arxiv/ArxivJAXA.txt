Optical observations of NEA 3200 Phaethon (1983 TB) during the 2017 apparition (Myung-Jin Kim - 16 September, 2018)
The near-Earth asteroid 3200 Phaethon (1983 TB) is an attractive object not only from a scientific viewpoint but also because of JAXA's DESTINY+ target. We aim to refine the lightcurves and shape model of Phaethon using all available lightcurve datasets obtained via optical observation, as well as our time-series observation data from the 2017 apparition. We analysed the optical lightcurve of Phaethon and derived a synodic and a sidereal rotational period of 3.6039 h, with an axis ratio of a/b = 1.07. The ecliptic longitude (lambda) and latitude (beta) of the pole orientation were determined as (308, -52) and (322, -40) via two independent methods

Ground-based Characterization of Hayabusa2 Mission Target Asteroid 162173 Ryugu: Constraining Mineralogical Composition in Preparation for Spacecraft Operations (Lucille Le Corre - 8 December, 2017)
One such object is near-Earth asteroid (NEA) (162173) Ryugu, which is the target of the Japanese Space Agency's (JAXA) Hayabusa2 sample return mission. We observed Ryugu using the 3-m NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, on July 13, 2016 to constrain the object's surface composition, meteorite analogs, and link to other asteroids in the main belt and NEA populations. Our spectral analysis has found a near-perfect match between our spectrum of Ryugu and those of NEA (85275) 1994 LY and Mars-crossing asteroid (316720) 1998 BE7, suggesting that their surface regoliths have similar composition. We compared Ryugu's spectrum with that of main belt asteroid (302) Clarissa, the largest asteroid in the Clarissa asteroid family, suggested as a possible source of Ryugu by Campins et al

Thermal Modeling of Comet-Like Objects from AKARI Observation (Yoonsoo P. Bach - 19 September, 2017)
We investigated the physical properties of the comet-like objects 107P/(4015) Wilson--Harrington (4015WH) and P/2006 HR30 (Siding Spring; HR30) by applying a simple thermophysical model (TPM) to the near-infrared spectroscopy and broadband observation data obtained by AKARI satellite of JAXA when they showed no detectable comet-like activity. It was found that 4015WH, which was originally discovered as a comet but has not shown comet-like activity since its discovery, has effective size $ D= $ 3.74--4.39 km and geometric albedo $ p_V \approx $ 0.040--0.055 with thermal inertia $ Î= $ 100--250 J m$ ^{-2} $ K$ ^{-1} $ s$ ^{-1/2}$. The corresponding grain size is estimated to 1--3 mm. We also found that HR30, which was observed as a bare cometary nucleus at the time of our observation, have $ D= $ 23.9--27.1 km and $ p_V= $0.035--0.045 with $ Î= $ 250--1,000 J m$ ^{-2} $ K$ ^{-1} $ s$ ^{-1/2}$

Power Spectra Based Planck Constraints on Compensated Isocurvature, and Forecasts for LiteBIRD and CORE Space Missions (Jussi Valiviita - 24 January, 2017)
Finally, we derive forecasts for future satellite missions (LiteBIRD proposal to JAXA and Exploring Cosmic Origins with CORE proposal to ESA's M5 call). Due to its coarse angular resolution, LiteBIRD is not able to improve the constraints on CIP or $A_L$, but CORE-M5 approaches the cosmic variance limit and improves the CIP constraint to $Î^2_{rms}<0.0006\ (0.0014)$ at 68% (95%) CL, which is 9 times better than the current trispectrum based upper bound and 6 times better than obtained from the simulated Planck data

Hayabusa-2 Mission Target Asteroid 162173 Ryugu (1999 JU3): Searching for the Object's Spin-Axis Orientation (T. G. MÃ¼ller - 17 November, 2016)
The JAXA Hayabusa-2 mission was approved in 2010 and launched on December 3, 2014. The spacecraft will arrive at the near-Earth asteroid 162173 Ryugu in 2018 where it will perform a survey, land and obtain surface material, then depart in Dec 2019 and return to Earth in Dec 2020. We observed Ryugu with the Herschel Space Observatory in Apr 2012 at far-IR thermal wavelengths, supported by several ground-based observations to obtain optical lightcurves. In addition, we used a large set of Spitzer-IRAC observations obtained in the period Jan to May, 2013. We find that the solution which best matches our data sets leads to this C class asteroid having a retrograde rotation with a spin-axis orientation of (lambda = 310-340 deg; beta = -40+/-15 deg) in ecliptic coordinates, an effective diameter (of an equal-volume sphere) of 850 to 880 m, a geometric albedo of 0.044 to 0.050 and a thermal inertia in the range 150 to 300 Jm-2s-0.5K-1. Based on estimated thermal conductivities of the top-layer surface in the range 0.1 to 0.6 WK-1m-1, we calculated that the grain sizes are approximately equal to between 1 and 10 mm

Low-speed Impact Simulations into Regolith in Support of Asteroid Sampling Mechanism Design I.: Comparison with 1-g Experiments (Stephen R. Schwartz - 8 August, 2014)
This study is carried out in the framework of sample-return missions to asteroids that use a low-speed projectile as the primary component of its sampling mechanism (e.g., JAXA's Hayabusa and Hayabusa2 missions). For the targets, we consider 2 different monodisperse grain-diameter sizes: 5 mm and 3 mm. The impact speed of the projectile is 11 m s$^{-1}$ directed downward, perpendicular to the surface of the targets. As found in experiments, in the case of the larger target grain size (5 mm), a conically shaped projectile ejects a greater amount of mass than do projectiles of other shapes, including disks and spheres. We then find that numerically the results are sensitive to the normal coefficient of restitution of the grains, especially for impacts into targets comprised of smaller grains (3 mm)

Optical Properties of (162173) 1999 JU3: In Preparation for the JAXA Hayabusa 2 Sample Return Mission (Masateru Ishiguro - 21 July, 2014)
We investigated the magnitude-phase relation of (162173) 1999 JU3, a target asteroid for the JAXA Hayabusa 2 sample return mission. With the Shevchenko function, we found that the magnitude-phase relation exhibits linear behavior in a wide phase angle range (alpha = 5-75 deg) and shows weak nonlinear opposition brightening at alpha< 5 deg, providing a more reliable absolute magnitude of Hv = 19.25 +- 0.03. The phase slope (0.039 +- 0.001 mag/deg) and opposition effect amplitude (parameterized by the ratio of intensity at alpha=0.3 deg to that at alpha=5 deg, I(0.3)/I(5)=1.31+-0.05) are consistent with those of typical C-type asteroids. We also attempted to determine the parameters for the Hapke model, which are applicable for constructing the surface reflectance map with the Hayabusa 2 onboard cameras. in preparation), we obtained a geometric albedo of pv = 0.047 +- 0.003, phase integral q = 0.32 +- 0.03, and Bond albedo AB = 0.014 +- 0.002, which are commensurate with the values for common C-type asteroids.

Near-Earth asteroid-comet transition object 107P/ (4015) Wilson-Harrington is a possible target of the joint European Space Agency (ESA) and Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Marco Polo sample return mission. We present mid-infrared photometry in two filters (16 and 22 microns) obtained with NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope on February 12, 2007, and results from the application of the Near Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM).We obtained high S/N in two mid-IR bands allowing accurate measurements of its thermal emission.

The albedo of 4015 Wilson-Harrington is low, consistent with those of comet nuclei and primitive C-, P-, D-type asteorids.

The Hot Universe with XRISM and Athena (Matteo Guainazzi - 18 July, 2018)
Two future X-ray observatories: the JAXA-led XRISM (due to launch in the early 2020s), and the ESA Cosmic Vision L-class mission Athena (early 2030s) will provide breakthroughs in our understanding of how and when large-scale hot gas structures formed in the Universe, and in tracking their evolution from the formation epoch to the present day.
