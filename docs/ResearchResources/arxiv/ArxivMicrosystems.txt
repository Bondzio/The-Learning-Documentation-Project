Electrochemical membrane microactuator with a millisecond response time (Ilia V. Uvarov - 1 January, 2018)
Lack of fast and strong actuators to drive microsystems is well recognized. Here an electrochemical actuator is presented for which the response time can be as short as 1 ms. The working chamber of the actuator contains concentric titanium electrodes; it has a diameter of 500 um and a height of 8 um. The chamber is sealed by a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane of 30 um thick. Cyclic operation at frequency up to 667 Hz with a stroke of about 30% of the chamber volume is demonstrated. Controlled explosions in the chamber can push the membrane up to 90 um.

Breaking time-reversal symmetry with acoustic pumping of nanophotonic circuits (Donggyu B Sohn - 25 July, 2017)
Recently, optomechanical microsystems in which light and vibrational modes are coupled through ponderomotive forces, have demonstrated strong non-reciprocal effects through a variety of techniques, but always using optical pumping. We demonstrate mode conversion asymmetry up to 15 dB, efficiency as high as 17%, over bandwidth exceeding 1 GHz.

Highly energetic phenomena in water electrolysis (A. V. Postnikov - 14 January, 2017)
Water electrolysis performed in microsystems with a fast change of voltage polarity produces optically invisible nanobubbles containing H2 and O2 gases. Under a frequency of driving pulses above 100 kHz the process is accompanied by clicking sounds repeated every 50 ms or so. Fast video reveals that synchronously with the click a bubble is growing between the electrodes which reaches a size of 300 um in 50 us. The energy of a single event is estimated as 0.3 uJ and a significant part of this energy is transformed into mechanical work moving the piece. The observations are explained by the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen mixture in the initial bubble with a diameter of about 40 um
