For each country, we periodically examined its 500 most popular websites - 6,579 in total - for the presence of and updates to their privacy policy. While many websites already had privacy policies, we find that in some countries up to 15.7 % of websites added new privacy policies by May 25, 2018, resulting in 84.5 % of websites having privacy policies. 72.6 % of websites with existing privacy policies updated them close to the date. Most visibly, 62.1 % of websites in Europe now display cookie consent notices, 16 % more than in January 2018. We categorized all observed cookie consent notices and evaluated 16 common implementations with respect to their technical realization of cookie consent

Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus: a systematic comparison of citations in 252 subject categories (Alberto MartÃ­n-MartÃ­n - 5 October, 2018)
Despite citation counts from Google Scholar (GS), Web of Science (WoS), and Scopus being widely consulted by researchers and sometimes used in research evaluations, there is no recent or systematic evidence about the differences between them. In response, this paper investigates 2,448,055 citations to 2,299 English-language highly-cited documents from 252 GS subject categories published in 2006, comparing GS, the WoS Core Collection, and Scopus. GS consistently found the largest percentage of citations across all areas (93%-96%), far ahead of Scopus (35%-77%) and WoS (27%-73%). GS found nearly all the WoS (95%) and Scopus (92%) citations. Most citations found only by GS were from non-journal sources (48%-65%), including theses, books, conference papers, and unpublished materials. Many were non-English (19%-38%), and they tended to be much less cited than citing sources that were also in Scopus or WoS

As compared to existing state-of-the-art packet scheduling proposals, Slytherin achieves 18.6% lower 99th percentile flow completion times for short flows without any loss of throughput. Further, Slytherin drastically reduces 99th percentile queue length in switches by a factor of about 2x on average.

In this paper, we propose an Eclipse IDE-based web search solution that collects the data from three web search APIs-- Google, Yahoo, Bing and a programming Q & A site-- Stack Overflow. Experiments with 25 run time errors and exceptions show that the proposed approach outperforms the keyword-based search approaches with a recommendation accuracy of 96%. We also validate the results with a user study involving five prospective participants where we get a result agreement of 64.28%

WPSE: Fortifying Web Protocols via Browser-Side Security Monitoring (Stefano Calzavara - 24 June, 2018)
We formally prove that WPSE is expressive enough to protect web applications from a wide range of protocol implementation bugs and web attacks. We discuss concrete examples of attacks which can be prevented by WPSE on OAuth 2.0 and SAML 2.0, including a novel attack on the Google implementation of SAML 2.0 which we discovered by formalizing the protocol specification in WPSE. Moreover, we use WPSE to carry out an extensive experimental evaluation of OAuth 2.0 in the wild. Out of 90 tested websites, we identify security flaws in 55 websites (61.1%), including new critical vulnerabilities introduced by tracking libraries such as Facebook Pixel, all of which fixable by WPSE. Finally, we show that WPSE works flawlessly on 83 websites (92.2%), with the 7 compatibility issues being caused by custom implementations deviating from the OAuth 2.0 specification, one of which introducing a critical vulnerability.

Oh, What a Fragile Web We Weave: Third-party Service Dependencies In Modern Webservices and Implications (Aqsa Kashaf - 21 June, 2018)
The recent October 2016 DDoS attack on Dyn served as a wakeup call to the security community as many popular and independent webservices (e.g., Twitter, Spotify) were impacted. Our key findings are: (1) 73.14% of the top 100,000 popular services are vulnerable to reduction in availabil- ity due to potential attacks on third-party DNS, CDN, CA services that they exclusively rely on; (2) the use of third-party services is concentrated, so that if the top-10 providers of CDN, DNS and OCSP services go down, they can potentially impact 25%-46% of the top 100K most popular web services; (3) transitive depen- dencies significantly increase the set of webservices that exclusively depend on popular CDN and DNS service providers, in some cases by ten times (4) targeting even less popular webservices can potentially cause signifi- cant collateral damage, affecting upto 20% of the top- 100K webservices due to their shared dependencies

Tight Bound of Incremental Cover Trees for Dynamic Diversification (Hannah Marienwald - 15 June, 2018)
Dynamic diversification---finding a set of data points with maximum diversity from a time-dependent sample pool---is an important task in recommender systems, web search, database search, and notification services, to avoid showing users duplicate or very similar items. Specifically, it was empirically observed that ICT typically provides a set with its diversity only marginally ($\sim 1/ 1.2$ times) worse than the greedy max-min (GMM) algorithm, the state-of-the-art method for static diversification with its performance bound optimal for any polynomial time algorithm. Nevertheless, the known performance bound for ICT is 4 times worse than this optimal bound

Author-level metrics in the new academic profile platforms: The online behaviour of the Bibliometrics community (Alberto MartÃ­n-MartÃ­n - 16 April, 2018)
This study has three objectives: a) to analyse the uptake of some of the most popular platforms (Google Scholar Citations, ResearcherID, ResearchGate, Mendeley and Twitter) by a specific scientific community (bibliometrics, scientometrics, informetrics, webometrics, and altmetrics); b) to compare the metrics available from each platform; and c) to determine the meaning of all these new metrics. To do this, the data available in these platforms about a sample of 811 authors (researchers in bibliometrics for whom a public profile Google Scholar Citations was found) were extracted. A total of 31 metrics were analysed. The results show that a high number of the analysed researchers only had a profile in Google Scholar Citations (159), or only in Google Scholar Citations and ResearchGate (142)

Identifying single influential publications in a research field: New analysis opportunities of the CRExplorer (Andreas Thor - 21 March, 2018)
The program CRExplorer (see www.crexplorer.net) was specifically developed by Thor, Marx, Leydesdorff, and Bornmann (2016a, 2016b) for applying RPYS to publication sets downloaded from Scopus or Web of Science. The new methods are demonstrated in this study using all the papers published in Scientometrics between 1978 and 2016. The indicators N_TOP50, N_TOP25, and N_TOP10 can be used to identify those CRs which belong to the 50%, 25%, or 10% most frequently cited publications (CRs) over many citing publication years. In the Scientometrics dataset, for example, Lotka's (1926) paper on the distribution of scientific productivity belongs to the top 10% publications (CRs) in 36 citing years. CRs can have below average (-), average (0), or above average (+) impact in citing years (whereby average is meant in the sense of expected values). 00++---0--00) is used by the program to identify papers with typical impact distributions. ---0000---++).

SLAC: A Sparsely Labeled Dataset for Action Classification and Localization (Hang Zhao - 26 December, 2017)
This paper describes a procedure for the creation of large-scale video datasets for action classification and localization from unconstrained, realistic web data. The scalability of the proposed procedure is demonstrated by building a novel video benchmark, named SLAC (Sparsely Labeled ACtions), consisting of over 520K untrimmed videos and 1.75M clip annotations spanning 200 action categories. Using our proposed framework, annotating a clip takes merely 8.8 seconds on average. This represents a saving in labeling time of over 95% compared to the traditional procedure of manual trimming and localization of actions. On Kinetics, UCF-101 and HMDB-51, models pre-trained on SLAC outperform baselines trained from scratch, by 2.0%, 20.1% and 35.4% in top-1 accuracy, respectively when RGB input is used. On THUMOS14 and ActivityNet-v1.3, our localization model improves the mAP of baseline model by 8.6% and 2.5%, respectively.

In the context of a comprehensive Microsoft Academic (MA) study, we explored in an initial step the quality of linked references data in MA in comparison with Web of Science (WoS). We found that the concordance of linked references between MA and WoS ranges from weak to non-existent for the full sample (publications of the University of Zurich with less than 50 linked references in MA). An analysis with a sample restricted to less than 50 linked references in WoS showed a strong agreement between linked references in MA and WoS.

Identifying Subjective and Figurative Language in Online Dialogue (Stephanie M. Lukin - 28 August, 2017)
More and more of the information on the web is dialogic, from Facebook newsfeeds, to forum conversations, to comment threads on news articles. We aim to automatically identify sarcastic and nasty utterances in unannotated online dialogue, extending a bootstrapping method previously applied to the classification of monologic subjective sentences in Riloff and Weibe 2003. Our method is as follows: 1) Explore methods for identifying sarcastic and nasty cue words and phrases in dialogues; 2) Use the learned cues to train a sarcastic (nasty) Cue-Based Classifier; 3) Learn general syntactic extraction patterns from the sarcastic (nasty) utterances and define fine-tuned sarcastic patterns to create a Pattern-Based Classifier; 4) Combine both Cue-Based and fine-tuned Pattern-Based Classifiers to maximize precision at the expense of recall and test on unannotated utterances.

Men Also Like Shopping: Reducing Gender Bias Amplification using Corpus-level Constraints (Jieyu Zhao - 28 July, 2017)
Structured prediction models are used in these tasks to take advantage of correlations between co-occurring labels and visual input but risk inadvertently encoding social biases found in web corpora. For example, the activity cooking is over 33% more likely to involve females than males in a training set, and a trained model further amplifies the disparity to 68% at test time. Our method results in almost no performance loss for the underlying recognition task but decreases the magnitude of bias amplification by 47.5% and 40.5% for multilabel classification and visual semantic role labeling, respectively.

Computer Self-efficacy and Its Relationship with Web Portal Usage: Evidence from the University of the East (Rex P. Bringula - 8 July, 2017)
Data showed that the respondents were relatively young (M = 40 years old), majority had masters degree (f = 85, 72%), most had been using the web portal for four semesters (f = 60, 51%), and the large part were intermediate web portal users (f = 69, 59%). They were highly skilled in using the computer (M = 4.29) and skilled in using the Internet (M = 4.28). E-learning services (M = 3.29) and online library resources (M = 3.12) were only used occasionally. Pearson correlation revealed that age was positively correlated with online library resources (r = 0.267, p < 0.05) and a negative relationship existed between perceived skill level in using the portal and online library resources usage (r = -0.206, p < 0.05). A 2x2 chi square revealed that the highest educational attainment had a significant relationship with online library resources (chi square = 5.489, df = 1, p < 0.05).

Decoupled-IFTTT: Constraining Privilege in Trigger-Action Platforms for the Internet of Things (Earlence Fernandes - 3 July, 2017)
Trigger-Action platforms are an emerging class of web-based systems that enable users to create automation rules (or recipes) of the form, "If there is a smoke alarm, then turn off my oven." These platforms stitch together various online services including Internet of Things devices, social networks, and productivity tools by obtaining OAuth tokens on behalf of users. We find that 75% of IFTTT's channels, an abstraction of online services, use overprivileged OAuth tokens, increasing risks in the event of a compromise. Our evaluation establishes that dIFTTT poses modest overhead: it adds less than 15ms of latency to recipe execution time, and reduces throughput by 2.5%.

The emergence and evolution of the research fronts in HIV/AIDS research (David Fajardo-Ortiz - 31 May, 2017)
A search of papers with the identifiers "HIV/AIDS", "Human Immunodeficiency Virus", "HIV-1" and "Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome" in the Web of Science (Thomson Reuters), was carried out. Then, a sub-network of the papers with the highest number of inter-citations (with a minimal in-degree of 28) was selected to perform a combination of network clustering and text mining to identify the paradigmatic research fronts and analyze their dynamics. The emergence and evolution of the biomedical fronts in HIV/AIDS research is explained not just by the partition of the problem in elements and interactions leading to increasingly specialized communities, but also by changes in the technological context of this health problem and the dramatic changes in the epidemiological reality of HIV/AIDS that occurred between 1993 and 1995.

On the Content Security Policy Violations due to the Same-Origin Policy (DoliÃ¨re Francis SomÃ© - 22 March, 2017)
Modern browsers implement different security policies such as the Content Security Policy (CSP), a mechanism designed to mitigate popular web vulnerabilities, and the Same Origin Policy (SOP), a mechanism that governs interactions between resources of web pages. We analyse 1 million pages from 10,000 top Alexa sites and report that at least 31.1% of current CSP-enabled pages are potentially vulnerable to CSP violations. Further considering real-world situations where those pages are involved in same-origin nested browsing contexts, we found that in at least 23.5% of the cases, CSP violations are possible

Web 2.0 for Small and medium Sized Companies: A practical Case Study (Mark Abraham Magumba - 8 November, 2016)
This project is a holistic analysis of web 2.0 and combines ideas from systems theory and organizational theory and goes on to attempt to bridge the gap between the ongoing theoretical discourse and its implications for the development process. Effectively this work posits that unless a practical framework can be synthesized from this rich debate the application and development of web 2.0 is at risk of proceeding haphazardly and this could potentially limit the benefits organizations reap from it. It then establishes the applicability of web 2.0 to the small organization and accordingly applies the framework to a practical case study.

A Crowdsourcing Approach To Collecting Tutorial Videos -- Toward Personalized Learning-at-Scale (Jacob Whitehill - 22 April, 2017)
We investigated the feasibility of crowdsourcing full-fledged tutorial videos from ordinary people on the Web on how to solve math problems related to logarithms. Results of our study, in which we collected 399 videos from 66 unique "teachers" on Mechanical Turk, suggest that (1) approximately 100 videos -- over $80\%$ of which are mathematically fully correct -- can be crowdsourced per week for \$5/video; (2) the crowdsourced videos exhibit significant diversity in terms of language style, presentation media, and pedagogical approach; (3) the average learning gains (posttest minus pretest score) associated with watching the videos was stat.~sig.~higher than for a control video ($0.105$ versus $0.045$); and (4) the average learning gains ($0.1416$) from watching the best tested crowdsourced videos was comparable to the learning gains ($0.1506$) from watching a popular Khan Academy video on logarithms.

How Many Folders Do You Really Need? (Mihajlo Grbovic - 29 June, 2016)
Recently however, automatic classification offering the same categories to all users has started to appear in some Web mail clients, such as AOL or Gmail. We report how we have discovered that a set of 6 "latent" categories (one for human- and the others for machine-generated messages) can explain a significant portion of email traffic. Experimental evaluation was performed on more than 500 billion messages received during a period of six months by users of Yahoo mail service, who elected to be part of such research studies. Our system achieved precision and recall rates close to 90% and the latent categories we discovered were shown to cover 70% of both email traffic and email search queries

How to end password reuse on the web (Ke Coby Wang - 1 May, 2018)

These mechanisms are consistent with common user experience today, and so our framework should be unobtrusive to users who do not reuse similar passwords across websites (e.g., due to having adopted a password manager)
