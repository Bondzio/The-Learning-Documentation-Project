When Fashion Meets Big Data: Discriminative Mining of Best Selling Clothing Features (Kuan-Ting Chen - 22 February, 2017)
Undeniably, shopping is one of the most essential activities in our society and studying consumer's shopping behavior is important for the industry as well as sociology and psychology. In this work, we design a novel system that consists of three major components: 1) exploring and organizing a large-scale clothing dataset from a online shopping website, 2) pruning and extracting images of best-selling products in clothing item data and user transaction history, and 3) utilizing a machine learning based approach to discovering fine-grained clothing attributes as the representative and discriminative characteristics of popular clothing style elements

Latency-Bounded Target Set Selection in Social Networks (Ferdinando Cicalese - 17 April, 2014)
Motivated by applications in sociology, economy and medicine, we study variants of the Target Set Selection problem, first proposed by Kempe, Kleinberg and Tardos. The activation process in $G$ proceeds as follows: initially, at round 0, all vertices in the target set are activated; subsequently at each round $r\geq 1$ every vertex of $G$ becomes activated if at least $t(v)$ of its neighbors are already active by round $r-1$

Dynamics of Trust Reciprocation in Heterogenous MMOG Networks (Ayush Singhal - 18 April, 2013)
Understanding the dynamics of reciprocation is of great interest in sociology and computational social science. The chat network has the highest level of reciprocation (33%) because there are essentially no barriers to it. The trade network has a lower rate of reciprocation (27%) because it has the obvious barrier of requiring more goods or money for exchange; morever, there is no clear benefit to returning a trade link except in terms of social connections. The trust network has the lowest reciprocation (14%) because this equates to sharing certain within-game assets such as weapons, and so there is a high barrier for such connections because they require faith in the players that are granted such high access. Using the number of trades (both before and after the initial trust link) boosts our ability to predict if the trust will be reciprocated up to 11% with respect to the AUC.

Ten-Year Cross-Disciplinary Comparison of the Growth of Open Access and How it Increases Research Citation Impact (C. Hajjem - 15 August, 2006)
We tested 1,307,038 articles published across 12 years (1992-2003) in 10 disciplines (Biology, Psychology, Sociology, Health, Political Science, Economics, Education, Law, Business, Management). A robot trawls the Web for full-texts using reference metadata ISI citation data (signal detectability d'=2.45; bias = 0.52). Percentage OA (relative to total OA + NOA) articles varies from 5%-16% (depending on discipline, year and country) and is slowly climbing annually (correlation r=.76, sample size N=12, probability p < 0.005). Comparing OA and NOA articles in the same journal/year, OA articles have consistently more citations, the advantage varying from 36%-172% by discipline and year. Comparing articles within six citation ranges (0, 1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15, 16+ citations), the annual percentage of OA articles is growing significantly faster than NOA within every citation range (r > .90, N=12, p < .0005) and the effect is greater with the more highly cited articles (r = .98, N=6, p < .005). Causality cannot be determined from these data, but our prior finding of a similar pattern in physics, where percent OA is much higher (and even approaches 100% in some subfields), makes it unlikely that the OA citation advantage is merely or mostly a self-selection bias (for making only one's better articles OA)

Learning Continuous-Time Social Network Dynamics (Yu Fan - 9 May, 2012)
We demonstrate that a number of sociology models for social network dynamics can be viewed as continuous time Bayesian networks (CTBNs). A sampling-based approximate inference method for CTBNs can be used as the basis of an expectation-maximization procedure that achieves better accuracy in estimating the parameters of the model than the standard method of moments algorithmfromthe sociology literature

Category-Based Routing in Social Networks: Membership Dimension and the Small-World Phenomenon (Full) (David Eppstein - 20 October, 2011)
A classic experiment by Milgram shows that individuals can route messages along short paths in social networks, given only simple categorical information about recipients (such as "he is a prominent lawyer in Boston" or "she is a Freshman sociology major at Harvard")

Untangling the Web of E-Research: Towards a Sociology of Online Knowledge (Eric T. Meyer - 14 August, 2009)
In this article we argue that it is necessary to reconceptualize the ways in which we seek to measure and understand e-Research by developing a sociology of knowledge based on our understanding of how science has been transformed historically and shifted into online forms
