Computationally Inferred Genealogical Networks Uncover Long-Term Trends in Assortative Mating (Eric Malmi - 16 February, 2018)
Genealogical networks, also known as family trees or population pedigrees, are commonly studied by genealogists wanting to know about their ancestry, but they also provide a valuable resource for disciplines such as digital demography, genetics, and computational social science. Interestingly, we do not observe this tendency to consistently decrease (nor increase) over our study period of 150 years.

SegDenseNet: Iris Segmentation for Pre and Post Cataract Surgery (Aditya Lakra - 19 April, 2018)
Cataract is caused due to various factors such as age, trauma, genetics, smoking and substance consumption, and radiation. India, which hosts the largest biometrics project in the world, has about 8 million people undergoing cataract surgery annually. The experiments on the IIITD Cataract database show that improving the segmentation enhances the identification by up to 25% across different sensors and matchers.

The Cultural Evolution of National Constitutions (Daniel N. Rockmore - 18 November, 2017)
We explore how ideas from infectious disease and genetics can be used to uncover patterns of cultural inheritance and innovation in a corpus of 591 national constitutions spanning 1789 - 2008. Using these topics we derive a diffusion network for borrowing from ancestral constitutions back to the US Constitution of 1789 and reveal that constitutions are complex cultural recombinants

Using Deep Learning to Examine the Association between the Built Environment and Neighborhood Adult Obesity Prevalence (Adyasha Maharana - 2 November, 2017)
Obesity has been linked to factors such as, genetics, diet, physical activity and the environment. The extracted features of the built environment explained 72% to 90% of the variation in obesity prevalence across cities. Outof-sample predictions were considerably high with correlations greater than 80% between predicted and true obesity prevalence across all census tracts

First, a brute-force WSD algorithm is applied to short context windows (up to 10 words) selected from the document in order to generate a short list of likely sense configurations for each window

Wireless Optogenetic Nanonetworks: Device Model and Charging Protocols (Stefanus A. Wirdatmadja - 20 June, 2017)

We have recently proposed the concept of wireless optogenetic nanonetworking devices (WiOptND), addressing these long-term deployment problems, and at the same time targeting single neuron stimulation [1]. Simulation results show the drop of stimulation ratio for 25% and more stable trend in its efficiency ratio are exhibited on Markov-Chain based Time-Delay Patterns compared to Change and Fire

The Benefit of Sex in Noisy Evolutionary Search (Tobias Friedrich - 10 February, 2015)
The benefit of sexual recombination is one of the most fundamental questions both in population genetics and evolutionary computation. For a simple noisy fitness function with additive Gaussian posterior noise $\mathcal{N}(0,Ï^2)$, we prove that the mutation-only $Î¼+1$ EA typically cannot handle noise in polynomial time for $Ï^2$ large enough while the cGA runs in polynomial time as long as the population size is not too small

It is known that the error in reconstructing sparse signals from standard one-bit measurements is bounded below by $Î©(Î»^{-1})$

A hybrid evolutionary algorithm with importance sampling for multi-dimensional optimization (Guanghui Huang - 22 August, 2013)

Multiplicative Updates in Coordination Games and the Theory of Evolution (Erick Chastain - 15 August, 2012)
We study the population genetics of Evolution in the important special case of weak selection, in which all fitness values are assumed to be close to one another. Importantly, the utility maximized in this game, as well as the amount by which each allele is boosted, is precisely the allele's mixability, or average fitness, a quantity recently proposed in [1] as a novel concept that is crucial in understanding natural selection under sex, thus providing a rigorous demonstration of that insight. Establishing large supports involves answering through a novel technique the following question: what is the probability that for a random square matrix A both systems Ax = 1 and A^T y = 1 have positive solutions? Both the question and the technique may be of broader interest.
