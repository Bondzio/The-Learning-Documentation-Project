Which country epitomizes the world? A study from the perspective of demographic composition (Takahiro Yoshida - 29 September, 2018)
Accordingly, we identify the following countries and regions as epitomes of the world population structure through different periods: India, Northern Africa and South Africa, in the 1990s, South America in 2015 to 2030, Oceania and Northern America in 2040, Uruguay and Puerto Rico in 2050 to 2060, and Italy and Japan in the distant future. We then cluster countries based on the similarity of their population structures in 2015 and correspond each cluster to a certain period

Modeling Dengue Vector Population Using Remotely Sensed Data and Machine Learning (J. M. Scavuzzo - 4 May, 2018)
In particular, Aedes Ã¦gypti (Linnaeus) is the main vector for Chikungunya, Dengue, and Zika viruses in Latin America and it represents a global threat. The present work includes the temporal modeling of the oviposition activity (measured weekly on 50 ovitraps in a north Argentinean city) of Aedes Ã¦gypti (Linnaeus), based on time series of data extracted from operational earth observation satellite images. We use are NDVI, NDWI, LST night, LST day and TRMM-GPM rain from 2012 to 2016 as predictive variables. These results provide better alternatives to be implemented operatively on the Argentine geospatial Risk system that is running since 2012.

How Polarized Have We Become? A Multimodal Classification of Trump Followers and Clinton Followers (Yu Wang - 2 November, 2017)
Polarization in American politics has been extensively documented and analyzed for decades, and the phenomenon became all the more apparent during the 2016 presidential election, where Trump and Clinton depicted two radically different pictures of America. Inspired by this gaping polarization and the extensive utilization of Twitter during the 2016 presidential campaign, in this paper we take the first step in measuring polarization in social media and we attempt to predict individuals' Twitter following behavior through analyzing ones' everyday tweets, profile images and posted pictures. We are able to achieve an accuracy of 69%, suggesting that the high degree of polarization recorded in the literature has started to manifest itself in social media as well.

Estimating the reproductive number, total outbreak size, and reporting rates for Zika epidemics in South and Central America (Deborah P. Shutt - 27 February, 2017)
As South and Central American countries prepare for increased birth defects from Zika virus outbreaks and plan for mitigation strategies to minimize ongoing and future outbreaks, understanding important characteristics of Zika outbreaks and how they vary across regions is a challenging and important problem. We developed a mathematical model for the 2015 Zika virus outbreak dynamics in Colombia, El Salvador, and Suriname. We then estimated the basic reproduction number, or the expected number of new human infections arising from a single infected human, to range between 4 and 6 for El Salvador and Suriname with a median of 4.3 and 5.3, respectively. We estimated the reporting rate to be around 16% in El Salvador and 18% in Suriname with estimated total outbreak sizes of 73,395 and 21,647 people, respectively

The reproductive number of Zika in municipalities of Antioquia, Colombia: stratifying the potential transmission of an ongoing epidemic (Juan Ospina - 19 September, 2016)
Introduction: Zika epidemic in America was declared a public health emergency of international concern after the rapid spread in the region. The approximate solution of the model in terms of individuals recovered in each time unit, allowed to obtain estimate of the model parameters including the basic reproduction number (Ro) and its 95% confidence intervals. Results: Ro was estimated for 20 municipalities, all located at less than 2200 meters above sea level. From January to April 2016, between 17 and 347 cases were reported from these municipalities. Of these, 15 municipalities had a high potential for transmission (Ro>1) and 5 had less potential (Ro<1), although in 3 of these, transmission was later possible because its upper confidence interval of Ro was greater than one. Conclusion: Surveillance and control of Zika should be directed primarily to municipalities with Ro>1

The instruments used for test runs on the Faroe Islands in 2015 and at five sites in Indonesia in 2016 are described. The change of coronal brightness with distance from the Sun seen in the 2016 eclipse agrees with observations from the 1991 eclipse but differ substantially from the 2010 eclipse. The 2015 observations agree with 2016 and 1991 solar radii near the Sun, but are fainter at larger distances. Problems encountered during these test runs are discussed as well the solutions which will be implemented for the 2017 eclipse experiment.

Our results suggest that the virus will be in a scenario of vanishing if $R_0\leq 1$, and the virus will spread to the whole region if $R_{0}^F(t_0)\geq 1$ for some $t_0\geq 0$, while if $R^F_0(0)<1<R_0$, the spreading or vanishing of the virus depends on the initial numbers of infected mosquitoes and birds, the area of the infected region and diffusion rates

Estimate of the reproduction number of the 2015 Zika virus outbreak in Barranquilla, Colombia, and estimation of the relative role of sexual transmission (Sherry Towers - 15 January, 2017)
Background: In 2015, the Zika arbovirus (ZIKV) began circulating in the Americas, rapidly expanding its global geographic range in explosive outbreaks. Unusual among mosquito-borne diseases, ZIKV has been shown to also be sexually transmitted, although sustained autochthonous transmission due to sexual transmission alone has not been observed, indicating the reproduction number (R0) for sexual transmission alone is less than 1. Methods: We estimated the R0 of the 2015 ZIKV outbreak in Barranquilla, Colombia, through an analysis of the exponential rise in clinically identified ZIKV cases (n = 359 to the end of November, 2015). Findings: The rate of exponential rise in cases was rho=0.076 days-1, with 95 percent CI [0.066,0.087] days-1. We used a vector-borne disease model with additional direct transmission to estimate the R0; assuming the R0 of sexual transmission alone is less than 1, we estimated the total R0 = 3.8 [2.4,5.6], and that the fraction of cases due to sexual transmission was 0.23 [0.01,0.47] with 95 percent confidence

On the butterfly effect (Alexander Shnirelman - 22 May, 2016)
The term "butterfly effect" means an extreme sensitivity of a dynamical system to small perturbations: "The beating of a butterfly wing in South America can result in the considerable change of positions and force of a tropical cyclon in Atlantic 2 weeks later". The effect is robust, and the experiment is 100% reproducible.

A total of 38 fading event light curves were simultaneously modelled. The period of the fading event was found to be 1.36 s shorter and 100 times more precise than the previous published value. If CVSO 30 b would be a giant planet on a precessing orbit, which we cannot confirm, yet, the precession period may be shorter than previously thought

Identification of Potential Sites for Astronomical Observations in Northern South-America (G. PinzÃ³n - 22 April, 2015)
Criteria for sky clearance were established for two infrared GOES channels in order to determine potential sites in the Andes region of northern South-America. Twelve sites with five year averages of CSF for spectroscopic nights larger than 30% during the dry seasons were found to be suitable for astronomical observations. The best site with (220$\pm$42) spectroscopic clear nights per year is located in the Andes of Venezuela (70$^{\circ}$28'48"W, 9$^{\circ}$5'60"N) at an altitude of 3480 meters. Lower quality regions were found in Sierra Nevada de Santamarta and SerranÃ­a del PerijÃ¡ with (126$\pm$34) and (111$\pm$27) clear nights per year, respectively. Sites over the Andes are identified in Norte de Santander with (107$\pm$23) and in the north-east part of BoyacÃ¡ with a mean of (94$\pm$13) clear nights per year. Two sites at low latitude located in Ecuador with more than 100 clear nights per year and with similar seasonal CSF percentages were also identified. Five year evolution suggest a possible correlation be tween the lowest percentages observed during the rainy seasons of 2010 and 2011 with positive values of the Southern Oscillation Index.

Outflows, Dusty Cores, and a Burst of Star Formation in the North America and Pelican Nebulae (John Bally - 23 September, 2014)
We present observations of near-infrared 2.12 micro-meter molecular hydrogen outflows emerging from 1.1 mm dust continuum clumps in the North America and Pelican Nebula (NAP) complex selected from the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS). Hundreds of individual shocks powered by over 50 outflows from young stars are identified, indicating that the dusty molecular clumps surrounding the NGC 7000 / IC 5070 / W80 HII region are among the most active sites of on-going star formation in the Solar vicinity. A spectacular X-shaped outflow, MHO 3400, emerges from a young star system embedded in a dense clump more than a parsec from the ionization front associated with the Pelican Nebula (IC 5070). Suspected to be a binary, the source drives a pair of outflows with orientations differing by 80 degrees. The `Gulf of Mexico' located south of the North America Nebula (NGC 7000), contains a dense cluster of molecular hydrogen objects (MHOs), Herbig-Haro (HH) objects, and over 300 YSOs, indicating a recent burst of star formation. The largest outflow detected thus far in the North America and Pelican Nebula complex, the 1.6 parsec long MHO 3417 flow, emerges from a 500 Solar mass BGPS clump and may be powered by a forming massive star. Several prominent outflows such as MHO 3427 appear to be powered by highly embedded YSOs only visible at a wavelength > 70 micro-meters

Assessing the impact of space weather on the electric power grid based on insurance claims for industrial electrical equipment (Carolus J. Schrijver - 21 June, 2014)
Here, we perform a statistical analysis of 11,242 insurance claims from 2000 through 2010 for equipment losses and related business interruptions in North-American commercial organizations that are associated with damage to, or malfunction of, electrical and electronic equipment. We find that claims rates are elevated on days with elevated geomagnetic activity by approximately 20% for the top 5%, and by about 10% for the top third of most active days ranked by daily maximum variability of the geomagnetic field. The claims statistics thus reveal that large-scale geomagnetic variability couples into the low-voltage power distribution network and that related power-quality variations can cause malfunctions and failures in electrical and electronic devices that, in turn, lead to an estimated 500 claims per average year within North America

Occultation Evidence for a Satellite of the Trojan Asteroid (911) Agamemnon (Bradley Timerson - 11 October, 2013)
On 2012 January 19, observers in the northeastern United States of America observed an occultation of 8.0-mag HIP 41337 star by the Jupiter-Trojan (911) Agamemnon, including one video recorded with a 36cm telescope that shows a deep brief secondary occultation that is likely due to a satellite, of about 5 km (most likely 3 to 10 km) across, at 278 km $\pm$ 5 km (0.0931 arcsec) from the asteroid's center as projected in the plane of the sky. A satellite this small and this close to the asteroid could not be resolved in the available VLT adaptive optics observations of Agamemnon recorded in 2003. The outline of Agamemnon is fit well by an ellipse with dimensions 190.6 $\pm$ 0.9 km by 143.8 $\pm$ 1.5 km. The angular diameter of HIP 41337 was found to be 0.5 $\pm$ 0.1 milli-arcsec. After (624) Hektor, this could be the second Jupiter Trojan asteroid known to possess a small satellite.

Worldwide Patterns of Ancestry, Divergence, and Admixture in Domesticated Cattle (Jared E. Decker - 2 January, 2014)
The domestication and development of cattle has considerably impacted human societies, but the histories of cattle breeds have been poorly understood especially for African, Asian, and American breeds. Using genotypes from 43,043 autosomal single nucleotide polymorphism markers scored in 1,543 animals, we evaluate the population structure of 134 domesticated bovid breeds. Using 19 breeds, we map the cline of indicine introgression into Africa

Global Forty-Years Validation of Seasonal Precipitation Forecasts: Assessing El NiÃ±o-Driven Skill (R. Manzanas - 18 September, 2013)
Although predictability varies with region, season and lead-time, results indicate that 1) significant skill is mainly located in the tropics -20 to 40% of the total land areas-, 2) overall, SON (MAM) is the most (less) skillful season and 3) predictability does not decrease noticeably from one to four months lead-time -this is so especially in northern south America and the Malay archipelago, which seem to be the most skillful regions of the world-. Furthermore, models are shown to reproduce similar teleconnection patterns to those observed, especially in SON -with spatial correlations of around 0.6 in the tropics-

Reconstructing Native American Migrations from Whole-genome and Whole-exome Data (Simon Gravel - 15 November, 2013)
The 1000 Genomes Project provides a unique opportunity for improving our understanding of population genetic history by providing over a hundred sequenced low coverage genomes and exomes from Colombian (CLM), Mexican-American (MXL), and Puerto Rican (PUR) populations. Estimated Native American ancestry is 48% in MXL, 25% in CLM, and 13% in PUR. These ancestral populations likely split in close succession: the most likely scenario, based on a peopling of the Americas 16 thousand years ago (kya), supports that the MXL Ancestors split 12.2kya, with a subsequent split of the ancestors to CLM and PUR 11.7kya

Multi-site photometric campaign on the high amplitude Î´ Scuti star KIC 6382916 (C. Ulusoy - 25 April, 2013)
The star was observed over a 85-d interval at five different sites in North America and Europe during 2011. The light curve is dominated by two modes with frequencies $f_{1}$= 4.9107 and $f_{2}$= 6.4314\,d$^{-1}$. The third mode with $f_{3}$= 8.0350\,d$^{-1}$ has a much lower amplitude. We find that the theoretical models for $f_1$ and $f_2$ are in a best agreement with the observations and lead to value of l = 1 modes, but the mode identification of $f_3$ is uncertain due to its low amplitude. Non-adiabatic pulsation models show that frequencies below 6\,d$^{-1}$ are stable, which means that the low frequency of $f_1$ cannot be reproduced

Kinematics of the South Atlantic rift (Christian Heine - 16 June, 2013)
We model an initial E-W directed extension between South America and Africa (fixed in present-day position) at very low extensional velocities until Upper Hauterivian times ($\approx$126 Ma) when rift activity along in the equatorial Atlantic domain started to increase significantly. During this initial $\approx$17 Myr-long stretching episode the Pre-salt basin width on the conjugate Brazilian and West African margins is generated. An intermediate stage between 126.57 Ma and Base Aptian is characterised by strain localisation, rapid lithospheric weakening in the equatorial Atlantic domain, resulting in both progressively increasing extensional velocities as well as a significant rotation of the extension direction to NE-SW. Final breakup between South America and Africa occurred in the conjugate Santos--Benguela margin segment at around 113 Ma and in the Equatorial Atlantic domain between the Ghanaian Ridge and the PiauÃ­-CearÃ¡ margin at 103 Ma

At 2.5 months after the peak, its light curves show a deep minimum, when the object was close to its pre-outburst optical brightness. Although HBC 722 exhibit all spectral characteristics of a bona fide FUor, its luminosity and accretion rate is too low, and its timescale is too fast compared to classical FUors

The density of egg-laying females influenced the sex ratio which tended towards a balance of sons and daughters,in contrast to the sex ratio of a single egg-laying female per host (1 son to 7 daughters)

Estimating body mass in the leatherback turtle Dermochelys coriacea (J. Y. Georges - 17 November, 2006)
Here we developed a general linear model to predict body mass from 17 morphometric measurements obtained from 49 leatherback turtles nesting in Awala Yalimapo beach, French Guiana, South America. A stepwise backward analysis removing independent parameters with P > 0.001 indicated that body mass can be estimated with 93% accuracy by Body Mass (kg) = - 709.146 + 3.391MedianBodyCirc (cm) + 2.664SCCL (cm), where SCCL is the standard curvilinear carapace length and MedianBodyCirc is body circumference at half of SCCL

Search for Small Trans-Neptunian Objects by the TAOS Project (W. P. Chen - 16 November, 2006)
The Taiwan-America Occultation Survey (TAOS) aims to determine the number of small icy bodies in the outer reach of the Solar System by means of stellar occultation. An array of 4 robotic small (D=0.5 m), wide-field (f/1.9) telescopes have been installed at Lulin Observatory in Taiwan to simultaneously monitor some thousand of stars for such rare occultation events. A few billion photometric measurements have been collected since the routine survey began in early 2005. Our preliminary result of a very low detection rate suggests a deficit of small TNOs down to a few km size, consistent with the extrapolation of some recent studies of larger (30--100 km) TNOs.

Arguments for a "U.S. Kamioka": SNOLab and its Implications for North American Underground Science Planning (W. C. Haxton - 6 October, 2006)
Stage I facility would be capable of meeting the needs of North America's next wave of underground experiments. This unused tunnel, part of the deepest (1040 m) tunnel system in the U.S., would allow the U.S. to establish, at low risk and low cost, a laboratory at a depth (2.12 km.w.e., or kilometers of water equivalent) quite similar to that of the Japanese laboratory Kamioka (2.04 km.w.e.). We also discuss possibilities for far-future Stage II (3.62 km.w.e.) and Stage III (5.00 km.w.e.) developments at the Pioneer tunnel, should future North American needs for deep space exceed that available at SNOLab.

Charon's radius and density from the combined data sets of the 2005 July 11 occultation (M. J. Person - 3 February, 2006)
The 2005 July 11 C313.2 stellar occultation by Charon was observed by three separate research groups, including our own, at observatories throughout South America. Here, the published timings from the three data sets have been combined to more accurately determine the mean radius of Charon: 606.0 +/- 1.5 km. Our analysis indicates that a slight oblateness in the body (0.006 +/- 0.003) best matches the data, with a confidence level of 86%. The oblateness has a pole position angle of 71.4 deg +/- 10.4 deg and is consistent with Charon's pole position angle of 67 deg. Charon's mean radius corresponds to a bulk density of 1.63 +/- 0.07 g/cm3, which is significantly less than Pluto's (1.92 +/- 0.12 g/cm3). Finally, unexplained differences between chord timings measured at Cerro Pachon and the rest of the data set could be indicative of a depression as deep as 7 km on Charon's limb.

The double-mode nature of the HADS star GSC 00144-03031 and the Petersen diagram of the class (E. Poretti - 13 June, 2005)
A very large dataset composed of 4722 photometric measurements was collected at six observatories in Europe and America. There is no hint of the excitation of additional modes (down to 0.6 mmag) and therefore GSC 00144-03031 seems to be a pure double--mode pulsator, with a very short fundamental radial mode (P=84 min). We also discovered other new double--mode pulsators in the databases of large--scale projects: OGLE BW2_V142, OGLE BW1_V207, ASAS3 094303-1707.3, ASAS3 000116-6037.0, NSVS 3234596 and NSVS 3324715

Optical photometry and spectral classification in the field of the open cluster NGC 6996 in the North America Nebula (Sandro Villanova - 23 January, 2004)
We present and discuss broad band CCD $UBV(I)_C$ photometry and low resolution spectroscopy for stars in the region of the open cluster NGC 6996, located in the North America Nebula. The width of the Main Sequence is mainly interpreted in terms of differential reddening, and indeed the stars' color excess $E_{B-V}$ ranges from 0.43 to 0.65, implying the presence of a significant and evenly distributed dust component. We find that the reddening slope and the total to selective absorption ratio $R_V$ toward NGC 6996 are anomalous. Moreover the reddening corrected colors and magnitudes allow us to derive estimates for the cluster distance and age, which turn out to be $760 \pm 70 pc$ ($V_{0}-M_{V} = 9.4 \pm 0.2$) and $\sim 350$ Myr, respectively. Basing on our results, we suggest that NGC 6996 is located in front of the North America Nebula, and does not seem to have any apparent relationship with it.

The cost for each card is under US$500 for parts, functionally replacing much more expensive electronics crates and modules at each high school site. The card has 4 analog discriminator inputs for photo-multiplier tube signals, a 4-channel Time-to-Digital converter for local coincidence and time-over-threshold measurements at 0.75 ns resolution, programmable trigger logic via a CPLD and microcontroller, and a built-in low-cost GPS receiver/antenna module (via external cable) to provide event trigger time stamps at better than 100 ns accuracy

Horizontal subduction zones, convergence velocity and the building of the Andes (Joseph Martinod - 17 November, 2010)
We discuss the Cenozoic history of horizontal slab segments below South America, arguing that they result from the subduction of oceanic plateaus whose effect is to switch the buoyancy of the young subducting plate to positive. Present-day horizontal slab segments may thus explain the diminution of the convergence velocity between the Nazca and South American plates since Late Miocene.
