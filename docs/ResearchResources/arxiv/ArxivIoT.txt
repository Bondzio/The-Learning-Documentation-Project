EC-GSM-IoT Network Synchronization with Support for Large Frequency Offsets (Stefan Lippuner - 23 September, 2018)
EDGE-based EC-GSM-IoT is a promising candidate for the billion-device cellular IoT (cIoT), providing similar coverage and battery life as NB-IoT. The goal of 20 dB coverage extension compared to EDGE poses significant challenges for the initial network synchronization, which has to be performed well below the thermal noise floor, down to an SNR of -8.5 dB. We present a low-complexity synchronization algorithm supporting up to 50 kHz initial frequency offset, thus enabling the use of a low-cost +/-25 ppm oscillator. The proposed algorithm does not only fulfill the 3GPP requirements, but surpasses them by 3 dB, enabling communication with an SNR of -11.5 dB or a maximum coupling loss of up to 170.5 dB.

This goal is accomplished by conducting comparison experiments on an Intel Arria 10 GX1150 FPGA and an Nvidia Tesla K40m GPU. The experiment results imply that the key advantages of adopting FPGAs for edge computing over GPUs are three-fold: 1) FPGAs can provide a consistent throughput invariant to the size of application workload, which is critical to aggregating individual service requests from various IoT sensors; (2) FPGAs offer both spatial and temporal parallelism at a fine granularity and a massive scale, which guarantees a consistently high performance for accelerating both high-concurrency and high-dependency algorithms; and (3) FPGAs feature 3-4 times lower power consumption and up to 30.7 times better energy efficiency, offering better thermal stability and lower energy cost per functionality.

SparCE: Sparsity aware General Purpose Core Extensions to Accelerate Deep Neural Networks (Sanchari Sen - 29 November, 2017)
However, these accelerators are prohibitive in many design scenarios (e.g., wearable devices and IoT sensors), due to stringent area/cost constraints. SparCE consists of 2 key micro-architectural enhancements- a Sparsity Register File (SpRF) that tracks zero registers and a Sparsity aware Skip Address (SASA) table that indicates instructions to be skipped. We model SparCE using the gem5 architectural simulator, and evaluate our approach on 6 image-recognition DNNs in the context of both training and inference using the Caffe framework. On a scalar microprocessor, SparCE achieves 19%-31% reduction in application-level. We also evaluate SparCE on a 4-way SIMD ARMv8 processor using the OpenBLAS library, and demonstrate that SparCE achieves 8%-15% reduction in the application-level execution time.

With the advancement of technology in the last few decades, leading to the widespread availability of miniaturized sensors and internet-connected things (IoT), security of electronic devices has become a top priority. AS-AES uses a shunt low-drop-out (LDO) regulator to suppress the AES current signature by 400x in the supply current traces. The shunt LDO has been fabricated and validated in 130 nm CMOS technology. System-level implementation of the AS-AES along with noise injection, shows that the system remains secure even after 50K encryptions, with 10x reduction in power overhead compared to that of noise addition alone.

Localization in Long-range Ultra Narrow Band IoT Networks using RSSI (Hazem Sallouha - 7 March, 2017)
In this work we take a closer look at the underlying aspects of received signal strength indicator (RSSI) based localization in UNB long-range IoT networks such as Sigfox. Through measurements we show that a location classification accuracy of 100% is achieved when the classes of nodes are isolated. When classes are approaching each other, our measurements show that we can still achieve an accuracy of 85%. Furthermore, when the density of the GPS nodes is increasing, we can rely on peer-to-peer triangulation and thus improve the possibility of localizing nodes with an error less than 20m from 20% to more than 60% of the nodes in our measurement scenario. 90% of the nodes is localized with an error of less than 50m in our experiment with non-optimized anchor node locations.
