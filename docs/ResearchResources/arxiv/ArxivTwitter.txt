We collect a large dataset of tweets during the 1st U.S. Presidential Debate in 2016 (#DebateNight) and we analyze its 1.5 million users from three perspectives: user influence, political behavior (partisanship and engagement) and botness. We find that not only social bots are more active on Twitter - starting more retweet cascades and retweeting more -- but they are 2.5 times more influential than humans, and more politically engaged

Is this word borrowed? An automatic approach to quantify the likeliness of borrowing in social media (Jasabanta Patro - 15 March, 2017)
We first propose context based clustering method to sample a set of candidate words from the social media data.Next, we propose three novel and similar metrics based on the usage of these words by the users in different tweets; these metrics were used to score and rank the candidate words indicating their borrowed likeliness. The Spearman's rank correlation between the two rankings (nearly 0.62 for all the three metric variants) is more than double the value (0.26) of the most competitive existing baseline reported in the literature. Some other striking observations are, (i) the correlation is higher for the ground truth data elicited from the younger participants (age less than 30) than that from the older participants, and (ii )those participants who use mixed-language for tweeting the least, provide the best signals of borrowing.

Feature Studies to Inform the Classification of Depressive Symptoms from Twitter Data for Population Health (Danielle Mowery - 27 January, 2017)
In an effort to better understand the predictive power of supervised machine learning classifiers and the influence of feature sets for efficiently classifying depression-related tweets on a large-scale, we conducted two feature study experiments. In the first experiment, we observed that lexical features are critical for identifying depressive symptoms, specifically for depressed mood (-35 points) and for disturbed sleep (-43 points). In the second experiment, we observed that the optimal F1-score performance of top ranked features in percentiles variably ranged across classes e.g., fatigue or loss of energy (5th percentile, 288 features) to depressed mood (55th percentile, 3,168 features) suggesting there is no consistent count of features for predicting depressive-related tweets

We exploit a unique dataset containing millions of tweets generated by more than 25 thousand users who have been manually identified, reported, and suspended by Twitter due to their involvement with extremist campaigns. We also leverage millions of tweets generated by a random sample of 25 thousand regular users who were exposed to, or consumed, extremist content. The performance of our framework is extremely promising, yielding in the different forecasting scenarios up to 93% AUC for extremist user detection, up to 80% AUC for content adoption prediction, and finally up to 72% AUC for interaction reciprocity forecasting

Vaporous Marketing: Uncovering Pervasive Electronic Cigarette Advertisements on Twitter (Eric M. Clark - 5 March, 2016)
Methods:All electronic cigarette keyword related tweets from a 10% sample of Twitter spanning January 2012 through December 2014 (approximately 850,000 total tweets) were identified and categorized as Automated or Organic by combining a keyword classification and a machine trained Human Detection algorithm. Results:The overwhelming majority (80%) of tweets were classified as automated or promotional in nature. The majority of these tweets were coded as commercialized (83.65% in 2013), up to 33% of which offered discounts or free samples and appeared on over a billion twitter feeds as impressions. The positivity of Organic (human) classified tweets has decreased over time (5.84 in 2013 to 5.77 in 2014) due to a relative increase in the negative words ban,tobacco,doesn't,drug,against,poison,tax and a relative decrease in the positive words like haha,good,cool. Automated tweets are more positive than organic (6.17 versus 5.84) due to a relative increase in the marketing words best,win,buy,sale,health,discount and a relative decrease in negative words like bad, hate, stupid, don't

Resurrecting My Revolution: Using Social Link Neighborhood in Bringing Context to the Disappearing Web (Hany M. SalahEldeen - 10 September, 2013)
In previous work we reported that resources linked in tweets disappeared at the rate of 11% in the first year followed by 7.3% each year afterwards. We also found that in the first year 6.7%, and 14.6% in each subsequent year, of the resources were archived in public web archives. In this paper we revisit the same dataset of tweets and find that our prior model still holds and the calculated error for estimating percentages missing was about 4%, but we found the rate of archiving produced a higher error of about 11.5%. We also discovered that resources have disappeared from the archives themselves (7.89%) as well as reappeared on the live web after being declared missing (6.54%). We have also tested the availability of the tweets themselves and found that 10.34% have disappeared from the live web. We found that using tweet signatures results in discovering replacement resources with 70+% textual similarity to the missing resource 41% of the time.

Particularly, 1) for predicting users' home locations, MLP successfully places 62% users and outperforms two state-of-the-art methods by 10% in accuracy, 2) for discovering users' multiple locations, MLP improves the baseline methods by 14% in recall, and 3) for explaining following relationships, MLP achieves 57% accuracy.

We compare the summaries generated in three languages for all the soccer games in "Copa America 2011" to reference live reports offered by Yahoo! Sports journalists. We show that simple text analysis methods which do not involve external knowledge lead to summaries that cover 84% of the sub-events on average, and 100% of key types of sub-events (such as goals in soccer)

Furthermore, to further improve the clustering quality by fully capturing the geographic distribution of tweets, we present fuzzy DBSTexC (F-DBSTexC), an extension of DBSTexC, which incorporates the notion of fuzzy clustering into the DBSTexC

The effect of wording on message propagation: Topic- and author-controlled natural experiments on Twitter (Chenhao Tan - 6 May, 2014)
To control for these confounding factors, we take advantage of the surprising fact that there are many pairs of tweets containing the same url and written by the same user but employing different wording. Given such pairs, we ask: which version attracts more retweets? This turns out to be a more difficult task than predicting popular topics

For example, how confident can we be that more people prefer item A to item B if item A had hundreds of upvotes on Reddit and item B had only a few? We investigate using an Internet game called GuessTheKarma that collects independent preference judgments (N=20,674) for 400 pairs of images, approximately 50 per pair. Overall, Reddit scores were not very good predictors of the true population preferences for items as measured by GuessTheKarma: the image with higher score was preferred by a majority of independent raters only 68% of the time. However, when one image had a low score and the other was one of the highest scoring in its subreddit, the higher scoring image was preferred nearly 90% of the time by the majority of independent raters

Opinion Conflicts: An Effective Route to Detect Incivility in Twitter (Suman Kalyan Maity - 2 September, 2018)
This trend is affecting users mentally and as a result they tend to leave Twitter and other such social networking sites thus depleting the active user base. We introduce a character level CNN model and incorporate the entity-specific sentiment information for efficient incivility detection which significantly outperforms multiple baseline methods achieving an impressive accuracy of 93.3% (4.9% improvement over the best baseline). In particular, we find that there are a significant fraction of account holders who act as repeat offenders - attacking the targets even more than 10 times

On the Challenges of Sentiment Analysis for Dynamic Events (Monireh Ebrahimi - 6 October, 2017)
Previous efforts to assess people's sentiment on Twitter have suggested that Twitter may be a valuable resource for studying political sentiment and that it reflects the offline political landscape. According to a Pew Research Center report, in January 2016 44 percent of US adults stated having learned about the presidential election through social media. Furthermore, 24 percent reported use of social media posts of the two candidates as a source of news and information, which is more than the 15 percent who have used both candidates' websites or emails combined. The first presidential debate between Trump and Hillary was the most tweeted debate ever with 17.1 million tweets.

Do we really need to catch them all? A new User-guided Social Media Crawling method (Fredrik Erlandsson - 13 December, 2017)
With the growing use of popular social media services like Facebook and Twitter it is challenging to collect all content from the networks without access to the core infrastructure or paying for it. USMC is validated by crawling 160 public Facebook pages, containing content from 368 million users including 1.3 billion interactions, and it is compared with two other crawling methods. The results show that it is possible to cover approximately 75% of the interactions on a Facebook page by sampling just 20% of its posts, and at the same time reduce the crawling time by 53%. In addition, the social network constructed from the 20% sample contains more than 75% of the users and edges compared to the social network created from all posts, and it has similar degree distribution.

Vaporous Marketing: Uncovering Pervasive Electronic Cigarette Advertisements on Twitter (Eric M. Clark - 5 March, 2016)
Methods:All electronic cigarette keyword related tweets from a 10% sample of Twitter spanning January 2012 through December 2014 (approximately 850,000 total tweets) were identified and categorized as Automated or Organic by combining a keyword classification and a machine trained Human Detection algorithm. Results:The overwhelming majority (80%) of tweets were classified as automated or promotional in nature. The majority of these tweets were coded as commercialized (83.65% in 2013), up to 33% of which offered discounts or free samples and appeared on over a billion twitter feeds as impressions. The positivity of Organic (human) classified tweets has decreased over time (5.84 in 2013 to 5.77 in 2014) due to a relative increase in the negative words ban,tobacco,doesn't,drug,against,poison,tax and a relative decrease in the positive words like haha,good,cool. Automated tweets are more positive than organic (6.17 versus 5.84) due to a relative increase in the marketing words best,win,buy,sale,health,discount and a relative decrease in negative words like bad, hate, stupid, don't

Is the post resharing cascade past the initial stage of explosive growth? And, which posts will be the most reshared in the future? We validate our model using one month of complete Twitter data and demonstrate a strong improvement in predictive accuracy over existing approaches.

They also show that the combinatory approach has impressive effects on n-grams, raising the confidence up to 83.15% on the 5-Grams, using majority vote and a balanced dataset (equal number of positive, negative and neutral tweets for training). In the n-gram graph cases the improvement was small to none, reaching 94.52% on the 4-gram graphs, using Orthodromic distance and a threshold of 0.001.

Contrary to existing notion that Facebook is used mostly as a private network, our findings reveal that more than 30% of public content that was present on Facebook during these events, was also present on Twitter. We then performed qualitative analysis on the content spread by the most active users during these events, and found that over 10% of the most active users on both networks post spam content. We used stylometric features from Facebook posts and tweet text to classify this spam content, and were able to achieve an accuracy of over 99% for Facebook, and over 98% for Twitter

For example, our study shows that traffic in the city of Madrid can be reduced by 59% if users are willing to share a ride with people who live and work within 1 km; if they can only accept a pick-up and drop-off delay up to 10 minutes, this potential benefit drops to 24%; if drivers also pick up passengers along the way, this number increases to 53%. If users are willing to ride only with people they know ("friends" in the CDR and OSN data sets), the potential of ride-sharing becomes negligible; if they are willing to ride with friends of friends, the potential reduction is up to 31%.

Multiple Location Profiling for Users and Relationships from Social Network and Content (Rui Li - 1 August, 2012)
In this paper, we study the problem of profiling Twitter users' locations with their following network and tweets. We propose a multiple location profiling model (MLP), which has three key features: 1) it formally models how likely a user follows another user given their locations and how likely a user tweets a venue given his location, 2) it fundamentally captures that a user has multiple locations and his following relationships and tweeted venues can be related to any of his locations, and some of them are even noisy, and 3) it novelly utilizes the home locations of some users as partial supervision. Particularly, 1) for predicting users' home locations, MLP successfully places 62% users and outperforms two state-of-the-art methods by 10% in accuracy, 2) for discovering users' multiple locations, MLP improves the baseline methods by 14% in recall, and 3) for explaining following relationships, MLP achieves 57% accuracy.

Partisan Asymmetries in Online Political Activity (Michael D. Conover - 19 June, 2012)
We examine partisan differences in the behavior, communication patterns and social interactions of more than 18,000 politically-active Twitter users to produce evidence that points to changing levels of partisan engagement with the American online political landscape. Analysis of a network defined by the communication activity of these users in proximity to the 2010 midterm congressional elections reveals a highly segregated, well clustered partisan community structure. Using cluster membership as a high-fidelity (87% accuracy) proxy for political affiliation, we characterize a wide range of differences in the behavior, communication and social connectivity of left- and right-leaning Twitter users. We find that in contrast to the online political dynamics of the 2008 campaign, right-leaning Twitter users exhibit greater levels of political activity, a more tightly interconnected social structure, and a communication network topology that facilitates the rapid and broad dissemination of political information.

Characterizing Information Diets of Social Media Users (Juhi Kulshrestha - 5 April, 2017)
In this work, we define a concept of information diet -- which is the topical distribution of a given set of information items (e.g., tweets) -- to characterize the information produced and consumed by various types of users in the popular Twitter social media. At a high level, we find that (i) popular users mostly produce very specialized diets focusing on only a few topics; in fact, news organizations (e.g., NYTimes) produce much more focused diets on social media as compared to their mass media diets, (ii) most users' consumption diets are primarily focused towards one or two topics of their interest, and (iii) the personalized recommendations provided by Twitter help to mitigate some of the topical imbalances in the users' consumption diets, by adding information on diverse topics apart from the users' primary topics of interest.

Exploiting Text and Network Context for Geolocation of Social Media Users (Afshin Rahimi - 15 June, 2015)
Evaluating over three Twitter datasets, we show that the empirical difference between text- and network-based methods is not great, and that hybridisation of the two is superior to the component methods, especially in contexts where the user graph is not well connected. We achieve state-of-the-art results on all three datasets.

A community role approach to assess social capitalists visibility in the Twitter network (Nicolas DuguÃ© - 15 June, 2015)
Based on a recently proposed method allowing to identify social capitalists, we tackle both points by studying how they are organized, and how their links spread across the Twitter follower-followee network. We then apply our method to the case of social capitalists and show they are highly visible on Twitter, due to the specific roles they hold.

Sifting Robotic from Organic Text: A Natural Language Approach for Detecting Automation on Twitter (Eric M. Clark - 14 June, 2016)
These inorganic and semi-organic Twitter entities can range from the benevolent (e.g., weather-update bots, help-wanted-alert bots) to the malevolent (e.g., spamming messages, advertisements, or radical opinions). Since the classifier operates on text alone, it is flexible and may be applied to any textual data beyond the Twitter-sphere.
