We collect a large dataset of tweets during the 1st U.S. Presidential Debate in 2016 (#DebateNight) and we analyze its 1.5 million users from three perspectives: user influence, political behavior (partisanship and engagement) and botness. We find that not only social bots are more active on Twitter - starting more retweet cascades and retweeting more -- but they are 2.5 times more influential than humans, and more politically engaged

Is this word borrowed? An automatic approach to quantify the likeliness of borrowing in social media (Jasabanta Patro - 15 March, 2017)
We first propose context based clustering method to sample a set of candidate words from the social media data.Next, we propose three novel and similar metrics based on the usage of these words by the users in different tweets; these metrics were used to score and rank the candidate words indicating their borrowed likeliness. The Spearman's rank correlation between the two rankings (nearly 0.62 for all the three metric variants) is more than double the value (0.26) of the most competitive existing baseline reported in the literature. Some other striking observations are, (i) the correlation is higher for the ground truth data elicited from the younger participants (age less than 30) than that from the older participants, and (ii )those participants who use mixed-language for tweeting the least, provide the best signals of borrowing.

Feature Studies to Inform the Classification of Depressive Symptoms from Twitter Data for Population Health (Danielle Mowery - 27 January, 2017)
In an effort to better understand the predictive power of supervised machine learning classifiers and the influence of feature sets for efficiently classifying depression-related tweets on a large-scale, we conducted two feature study experiments. In the first experiment, we observed that lexical features are critical for identifying depressive symptoms, specifically for depressed mood (-35 points) and for disturbed sleep (-43 points). In the second experiment, we observed that the optimal F1-score performance of top ranked features in percentiles variably ranged across classes e.g., fatigue or loss of energy (5th percentile, 288 features) to depressed mood (55th percentile, 3,168 features) suggesting there is no consistent count of features for predicting depressive-related tweets

We exploit a unique dataset containing millions of tweets generated by more than 25 thousand users who have been manually identified, reported, and suspended by Twitter due to their involvement with extremist campaigns. We also leverage millions of tweets generated by a random sample of 25 thousand regular users who were exposed to, or consumed, extremist content. The performance of our framework is extremely promising, yielding in the different forecasting scenarios up to 93% AUC for extremist user detection, up to 80% AUC for content adoption prediction, and finally up to 72% AUC for interaction reciprocity forecasting

Vaporous Marketing: Uncovering Pervasive Electronic Cigarette Advertisements on Twitter (Eric M. Clark - 5 March, 2016)
Methods:All electronic cigarette keyword related tweets from a 10% sample of Twitter spanning January 2012 through December 2014 (approximately 850,000 total tweets) were identified and categorized as Automated or Organic by combining a keyword classification and a machine trained Human Detection algorithm. Results:The overwhelming majority (80%) of tweets were classified as automated or promotional in nature. The majority of these tweets were coded as commercialized (83.65% in 2013), up to 33% of which offered discounts or free samples and appeared on over a billion twitter feeds as impressions. The positivity of Organic (human) classified tweets has decreased over time (5.84 in 2013 to 5.77 in 2014) due to a relative increase in the negative words ban,tobacco,doesn't,drug,against,poison,tax and a relative decrease in the positive words like haha,good,cool. Automated tweets are more positive than organic (6.17 versus 5.84) due to a relative increase in the marketing words best,win,buy,sale,health,discount and a relative decrease in negative words like bad, hate, stupid, don't

Resurrecting My Revolution: Using Social Link Neighborhood in Bringing Context to the Disappearing Web (Hany M. SalahEldeen - 10 September, 2013)
In previous work we reported that resources linked in tweets disappeared at the rate of 11% in the first year followed by 7.3% each year afterwards. We also found that in the first year 6.7%, and 14.6% in each subsequent year, of the resources were archived in public web archives. In this paper we revisit the same dataset of tweets and find that our prior model still holds and the calculated error for estimating percentages missing was about 4%, but we found the rate of archiving produced a higher error of about 11.5%. We also discovered that resources have disappeared from the archives themselves (7.89%) as well as reappeared on the live web after being declared missing (6.54%). We have also tested the availability of the tweets themselves and found that 10.34% have disappeared from the live web. We found that using tweet signatures results in discovering replacement resources with 70+% textual similarity to the missing resource 41% of the time.

Particularly, 1) for predicting users' home locations, MLP successfully places 62% users and outperforms two state-of-the-art methods by 10% in accuracy, 2) for discovering users' multiple locations, MLP improves the baseline methods by 14% in recall, and 3) for explaining following relationships, MLP achieves 57% accuracy.

We compare the summaries generated in three languages for all the soccer games in "Copa America 2011" to reference live reports offered by Yahoo! Sports journalists. We show that simple text analysis methods which do not involve external knowledge lead to summaries that cover 84% of the sub-events on average, and 100% of key types of sub-events (such as goals in soccer)

Furthermore, to further improve the clustering quality by fully capturing the geographic distribution of tweets, we present fuzzy DBSTexC (F-DBSTexC), an extension of DBSTexC, which incorporates the notion of fuzzy clustering into the DBSTexC

The effect of wording on message propagation: Topic- and author-controlled natural experiments on Twitter (Chenhao Tan - 6 May, 2014)
To control for these confounding factors, we take advantage of the surprising fact that there are many pairs of tweets containing the same url and written by the same user but employing different wording. Given such pairs, we ask: which version attracts more retweets? This turns out to be a more difficult task than predicting popular topics
