Causal Explanation Analysis on Social Media (Youngseo Son - 4 September, 2018)
Understanding causal explanations - reasons given for happenings in one's life - has been found to be an important psychological factor linked to physical and mental health. We achieve strong accuracies for both tasks but find different approaches best: an SVM for causality prediction (F1 = 0.791) and a hierarchy of Bidirectional LSTMs for causal explanation identification (F1 = 0.853). Finally, we explore applications of our complete pipeline (F1 = 0.868), showing demographic differences in mentions of causal explanation and that the association between a word and sentiment can change when it is used within a causal explanation.

Fake Cures: User-centric Modeling of Health Misinformation in Social Media (Amira Ghenai - 3 September, 2018)
This work examines the individuals on social media that are posting questionable health-related information, and in particular promoting cancer treatments which have been shown to be ineffective (making it a kind of misinformation, willful or not). Using a multi-stage user selection process, we study 4,212 Twitter users who have posted about one of 139 such "treatments", and compare them to a baseline of users generally interested in cancer. Considering features capturing user attributes, writing style, and sentiment, we build a classifier which is able to identify users prone to propagate such misinformation at an accuracy of over 90%, providing a potential tool for public health officials to identify such individuals for preventive intervention.

Prevalence of web trackers on hospital websites in Illinois (Robert Robinson - 3 May, 2018)
Little is known about how this technology is deployed on hospital or other health related websites. The websites of the 210 public hospitals in the state of Illinois, USA were evaluated with a web tracker identification tool. Web trackers were identified on 94% of hospital webs sites, with an average of 3.5 trackers on the websites of general hospitals. The websites of smaller critical access hospitals used an average of 2 web trackers. The most common web tracker identified was Google Analytics, found on 74% of Illinois hospital websites. Of the web trackers discovered, 88% were operated by Google and 26% by Facebook

Comparing Clinical Judgment with MySurgeryRisk Algorithm for Preoperative Risk Assessment: A Pilot Study (Meghan Brennan - 9 April, 2018)
The large amount of data contained in the electronic health record (EHR) creates barriers for physicians to recognize patients most at risk. Using 150 clinical cases we compared physicians' risk assessment before and after interaction with MySurgeryRisk, a validated machine-learning algorithm predicting preoperative risk for six major postoperative complications using EHR data. Results: The area under the curve (AUC) of MySurgeryRisk algorithm ranged between 0.73 and 0.85 and was significantly higher than physicians' risk assessments (AUC between 0.47 and 0.69) for all postoperative complications except cardiovascular complications. The AUC for repeated physician's risk assessment improved by 2% to 5% for all complications with the exception of thirty-day mortality. Physicians' risk assessment for acute kidney injury and intensive care unit admission longer than 48 hours significantly improved after knowledge exchange, resulting in net reclassification improvement of 12.4% and 16%, respectively

PuRe: Robust pupil detection for real-time pervasive eye tracking (Thiago Santini - 24 December, 2017)
Real-time, accurate, and robust pupil detection is an essential prerequisite to enable pervasive eye-tracking and its applications -- e.g., gaze-based human computer interaction, health monitoring, foveated rendering, and advanced driver assistance. Results show a pupil detection rate improvement of over 10 percentage points w.r.t. state-of-the-art algorithms in the two most challenging data sets (6.46 for all data sets), further pushing the envelope for pupil detection. state-of-the-art algorithms by 25.05 and 10.94 percentage points, respectively, demonstrating the meaningfulness of PuRe's confidence measure. PuRe operates in real-time for modern eye trackers (at 120 fps).

In particular, given $L$ channels, order $K\log K \left(1+\frac{1}{L}\log N\right)$ samples per channel, selected randomly from $N$ equispaced samples, suffice to guarantee with high probability exact estimation of $K$ normalized frequencies that are mutually separated by at least $\frac{4}{N}$

Equilibrium results indicate that 1) defenders can bound botnet activity, and 2) legislating a minimum level of security has only a limited effect, while incentivizing active defense can decrease botnet activity arbitrarily

The application of data mining techniques to support customer relationship management: the case of ethiopian revenue and customs authority (Belete Biazen Bezabeh - 30 June, 2017)
The application of data mining technique has been widely applied in different business areas such as health, education and finance for the purpose of data analysis and then to support and maximizes the organizations customer satisfaction in an effort to increase loyalty and retain customers business over their lifetimes . Once the customers data were collected, the necessary data preparation steps were conducted on it and finally a data set consisting of 46748 records was attained. The classification modeling was built by using J48 decision tree and multi layer perceptron ANN algorithms with 10-fold cross-validation and splitting (70% training and 30% testing) techniques. Among these models, a model which was built using J48 decision tree algorithm with default 10-fold cross-validation outperforms 99.95% of overall accuracy rate; while the classification accuracy of ANN is 99.71%

A Data-Driven Analysis of the Influence of Care Coordination on Trauma Outcome (You Chen - 26 May, 2017)
DESIGN We applied a spectral co-clustering methodology to simultaneously infer groups of patients and care coordination patterns, in the form of interaction networks of health care professionals, from electronic medical record (EMR) utilization data. The care coordination pattern for each patient group was represented by standard social network characteristics and its relationship with hospital LOS was assessed via a negative binomial regression with a 95% confidence interval. The EMRs were accessed by healthcare professionals from 179 operational areas during 158,467 operational actions. The first patient group exhibited the shortest hospital LOS and was managed by a care coordination pattern that involved the smallest number of operational areas (102 areas, as opposed to 125 and 138 for the other patient groups), but exhibited the largest number of collaborations between operational areas (e.g., an average of 27.1 connections per operational area compared to 22.5 and 23.3 for the other two groups). The hospital LOS for the second and third patient groups was 14 hours (P = 0.024) and 10 hours (P = 0.042) longer than the first patient group, respectively.

Experimental results upon ECG signals show that the proposed method, at a compression ratio of 10x, successfully reduces the isometry constant of the trained sensing matrices by 86% against random matrices and improves the overall reconstructed signal-to-noise ratio by 15dB over conventional model-driven approaches.

Modern Internet applications, from HD video-conferencing to health monitoring and remote control of power-plants, pose stringent demands on network latency, bandwidth and availability. To evaluate the potential of this approach, we first map the global substrate of inter-IXP pathlets that IXP members could offer, based on measurements for 229 IXPs worldwide. Up to 91 % of the total IPv4 address space can be served by such inter-domain routing brokers when working in concert with just a handful of large IXPs and their associated ISP members. Second, path diversity on the inter-IXP graph increases by up to 29 times, as compared to current BGP valley-free routing

Does Journaling Encourage Healthier Choices? Analyzing Healthy Eating Behaviors of Food Journalers (Palakorn Achananuparp - 3 May, 2018)
Surprisingly, our findings show that food journalers do not eat as healthily as they should despite their proclivity to health eating and their food choices resemble those of the general populace. Furthermore, we find that the journaling duration is only a marginal determinant of healthy eating outcomes and sociodemographic factors, such as gender and regions of residence, are much more predictive of healthy food choices.
