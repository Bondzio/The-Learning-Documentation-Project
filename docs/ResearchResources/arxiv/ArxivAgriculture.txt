Project G.N.O.S.I.S.: Geographical Network Of Synoptic Information System (Pietro Oliva - 3 November, 2012)
This doesn't mean we simply aim to add history to Google Earth (though it could be already a nice goal): the main idea behind GNOSIS project is to produce applications to "dress up" the Globe with a set of skin-maps representing the most various different kind of histories like the evolution of geology, genetics, agriculture, ethnology, linguistics, musicology, metallurgy and so forth, in time

Hedge detection as a lens on framing in the GMO debates: A position paper (Eunsol Choi - 5 June, 2012)
In the interests of furthering that goal, we propose the following specific, interesting and, we believe, relatively accessible question: In the controversy regarding the use of genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) in agriculture, do pro- and anti-GMO articles differ in whether they choose to adopt a "scientific" tone?

Wireless Sensor Networking for Rain-fed Farming Decision Support (J. Panchard - 30 December, 2009)
This motivated our deployment of a WSN system to support rain-fed agriculture in India. We base this claim on the lessons learned from the COMMON-Sense system deployment and the results of an extensive user experiment with agriculture scientists, which we describe in this paper.
