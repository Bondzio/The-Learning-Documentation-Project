Towards Low-level Cryptographic Primitives for JavaCards (Vasilios Mavroudis - 3 October, 2018)
JavaCard is a multi-application security platform deployed to over twenty billion smartcards, used in applications ranging from secure payments to telecommunications. While the platform is a popular choice for established commercial use cases (e.g., SIM cards in telecommunication networks), it has notably low adoption rates in: 1) application scenarios requiring recently-standardized cryptographic algorithms, 2) research projects, and 3) open source initiatives

Design Considerations for a 5G Network Architecture (Steven Bergren - 19 April, 2017)
The data rates of up to 10 GB/s will characterize 5G networks telecommunications standards that are envisioned to replace the current 4G/IMT standards. The number of network-connected devices is expected to be 7 trillion by the end of this year and the traffic is expected to rise by an order of magnitude in the next 8 years.

Study on 3GPP Rural Macrocell Path Loss Models for Millimeter Wave Wireless Communications (George R. MacCartney Jr. - 29 March, 2017)
This paper studies past rural macrocell (RMa) path loss models and exposes concerns with the current 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) TR 38.900 (Release 14) RMa path loss models adopted from the International Telecommunications Union - Radiocommunications (ITU-R) Sector. This paper shows how the 3GPP RMa large-scale path loss models were derived for frequencies below 6 GHz, yet they are being asserted for use up to 30 GHz, even though there has not been sufficient work or published data to support their validity at frequencies above 6 GHz or in the mmWave bands. This work shows the CI and CIH models can be used from 500 MHz to 100 GHz for rural mmWave coverage and interference analysis, without any discontinuity at 6 GHz as exists in today's 3GPP and ITU-R RMa models.

Indoor 5G 3GPP-like Channel Models for Office and Shopping Mall Environments (Katsuyuki Haneda - 13 March, 2016)
To meet these service demands the telecommunications industry is converging on a common set of 5G requirements which includes network speeds as high as 10 Gbps, cell edge rate greater than 100 Mbps, and latency of less than 1 msec. To reach these 5G requirements the industry is looking at new spectrum bands in the range up to 100 GHz where there is spectrum availability for wide bandwidth channels. For the development of new 5G systems to operate in bands up to 100 GHz there is a need for accurate radio propagation models which are not addressed by existing channel models developed for bands below 6 GHz. This paper presents a preliminary overview of the 5G channel models for bands up to 100 GHz in indoor offices and shopping malls, derived from extensive measurements across a multitude of bands. These studies have found some extensibility of the existing 3GPP models to the higher frequency bands up to 100 GHz

Radar In-Band and Out-of-Band Interference into LTE Macro and Small Cell Uplinks in the 3.5 GHz Band (Mo Ghorbanzadeh - 1 December, 2014)

Even though the results reveal impacts of radar interference on LTE systems performance, they provide clear indications of conspicuously narrower exclusion zones for LTE vis-Ã -vis those for WiMAX and pave the way toward deploying LTE at 3.5 GHz within the coastline populous areas.

Robotic Arm for Remote Surgery (Steven Dinger - 22 July, 2013)
Recent advances in telecommunications have enabled surgeons to operate remotely on patients with the use of robotics. The actuation system, or robotic arm, is based on a lead screw mechanism which can obtain a maximum speed of 0.28 m/s with a 1.5 degree/step for the end-effector. The infrared detection and encoder resolutions are below 0.6 mm/pixel and 0.4 mm respectively, which ensures the robotic arm can operate precisely. The control design results in a rise time of less than 0.5 s, a steady-state error of less than 1 mm and settling time of less than 1.4 s. The system accumulates, over an extended period of time, an error of approximately 4 mm due to inertial effects of the robotic arm

Assessing the Effectiveness of Section 271 Five Years After the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Daniel R. Shiman - 28 October, 2001)
A major goal of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 is to promote competition in both the local exchange and long distance wireline markets. In section 271 Congress permitted the Bell Operating Companies (BOCs) to enter the long distance market only if they demonstrate to the FCC that they have complied with the market-opening requirements of section 251. This paper examines the logic behind section 271, to determine if it is a reasonable means of achieving increased competition in both the local and long distance markets, given the technical characteristics of the industry and the legal and informational constraints on regulators who must ensure compliance

Globalization and Governance in Cyberspace: Mapping the Processes of Emergent Regime Formation in Global Information and Communications Policy (Derrick L. Cogburn - 23 September, 2001)
Key findings in this paper are: (1) that a range of social, political, economic, and technological factors are eroding the existing international telecommunications regime (e.g., VOIP;, call-back, VSATs, accounting rate restructuring, pressure for applicaitons development, and SMMEs); (2) a new regime for global information and communicaitons policy is emerging, but is being driven not by the broad possibilities of the Information Society, but by the more specific interests of global and multi-national corporations related to global e-commerce; (3) numerous strategic responses have been developed at national, subregional, and regional levels to the challenges of this transition in both developed and developing regions; and (4) without a collaborative response, the developing world will be further marginalized by this new regime.

Conceptualising Regulatory Change - Explaining Shifts in Telecommunications Governance (Seamus Simpson - 18 September, 2001)
Drawing on perspectives from telecommunications policy and neo-Gramscian understandings of international political economy, this paper offers an explanation and analysis of the shifting patterns of regulation which have been evident in the telecommunications sector in recent years. It aims to illustrate explain and explore the implications of the movement of regulatory sovereignty away from the nation-state, through regional conduits, to global organisations in the crystallisation of a world system of telecommunications governance.

Resource Discovery in Trilogy (Franck Chevalier - 8 February, 1999)
Although in this paper, Telecommunications and in particular Broadband networks are used as exemplars, the underlying system principles are applicable to any domain where a combination of experimental and literature-based resources are required.
