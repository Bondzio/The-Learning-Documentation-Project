Sampler Design for Bayesian Personalized Ranking by Leveraging View Data (Jingtao Ding - 21 September, 2018)
Second, focusing on the purchase feedback of E-commerce, we propose an effective sampler for BPR by leveraging the additional view data. Compared to the vanilla BPR that applies a uniform sampler on all candidates, our view-enhanced sampler enhances BPR with a relative improvement over 37.03% and 16.40% on two real-world datasets

Critically fast pick-and-place with suction cups (Hung Pham - 10 September, 2018)
Fast robotic pick-and-place with suction cups is a crucial component in the current development of automation in logistics (factory lines, e-commerce, etc.) By "critically fast" we mean the fastest possible movements for transporting an object such that it does not slip or fall from the suction cup. We experimentally validate the proposed pipeline on a physical robot system: the cycle time for a typical pick-and-place task was less than 5 seconds, planning and execution times included

Deep Reinforcement Learning for Page-wise Recommendations (Xiangyu Zhao - 9 August, 2018)
In real-world recommendations such as e-commerce, a typical interaction between the system and its users is -- users are recommended a page of items and provide feedback; and then the system recommends a new page of items. To effectively capture such interaction for recommendations, we need to solve two key problems -- (1) how to update recommending strategy according to user's \textit{real-time feedback}, and 2) how to generate a page of items with proper display, which pose tremendous challenges to traditional recommender systems

From the data sets crawled from a well-known social media platform Dianping in China, we find some insightful correlations between expenditures and rating scores: 1) transactions or experiences with higher expenditures usually lead to higher rating scores; 2) when the real expenditures are higher than users' normal spending behavior, the users usually give higher scores; and 3) there are multiple grades of expenditure behaviors

BIRDNEST: Bayesian Inference for Ratings-Fraud Detection (Bryan Hooi - 7 March, 2016)
Review fraud is a pervasive problem in online commerce, in which fraudulent sellers write or purchase fake reviews to manipulate perception of their products and services. Fake reviews are often detected based on several signs, including 1) they occur in short bursts of time; 2) fraudulent user accounts have skewed rating distributions. Hence, in this paper, we propose an approach for detecting fraudulent reviews which combines these 2 approaches in a principled manner, allowing successful detection even when one of these signs is not present. To combine these 2 approaches, we formulate our Bayesian Inference for Rating Data (BIRD) model, a flexible Bayesian model of user rating behavior. Experiments on real data show that BIRDNEST successfully spots review fraud in large, real-world graphs: the 50 most suspicious users of the Flipkart platform flagged by our algorithm were investigated and all identified as fraudulent by domain experts at Flipkart.

An Economic Analysis of User-Privacy Options in Ad-Supported Services (Joan Feigenbaum - 1 August, 2012)
We analyze the value to e-commerce website operators of offering privacy options to users, e.g., of allowing users to opt out of ad targeting. One of our main results in the case of a single site is that, under normally distributed utilities, if a privacy-sensitive user is worth at least $\sqrt{2} - 1$ times as much to advertisers as a privacy-insensitive user, the site operator should strive to make the cost of a privacy option as low as possible

We perform experiments with a variety of multi-modal social systems, spanning location-based social networks (Gowalla), social media services (Instagram, Orkut), e-commerce and review sites (Amazon, Ciao), and finally citation networks (Cora). The results indicate significant improvement in prediction accuracy over state of the art methods, and demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed approach for addressing a variety of different learning problems commonly occurring with multi-modal social data.

The Continuous Cold Start Problem in e-Commerce Recommender Systems (Lucas Bernardi - 5 August, 2015)
However, many real-life e-commerce applications suffer from an aggravated, recurring version of cold-start even for known users or items, since many users visit the website rarely, change their interests over time, or exhibit different personas. This paper exposes the `Continuous Cold Start' (CoCoS) problem and its consequences for content- and context-based recommendation from the viewpoint of typical e-commerce applications, illustrated with examples from a major travel recommendation website, Booking.com.

Globalization and Governance in Cyberspace: Mapping the Processes of Emergent Regime Formation in Global Information and Communications Policy (Derrick L. Cogburn - 23 September, 2001)
Key findings in this paper are: (1) that a range of social, political, economic, and technological factors are eroding the existing international telecommunications regime (e.g., VOIP;, call-back, VSATs, accounting rate restructuring, pressure for applicaitons development, and SMMEs); (2) a new regime for global information and communicaitons policy is emerging, but is being driven not by the broad possibilities of the Information Society, but by the more specific interests of global and multi-national corporations related to global e-commerce; (3) numerous strategic responses have been developed at national, subregional, and regional levels to the challenges of this transition in both developed and developing regions; and (4) without a collaborative response, the developing world will be further marginalized by this new regime.
