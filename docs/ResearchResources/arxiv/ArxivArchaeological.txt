Deep Learning the Indus Script (Satish Palaniappan - 1 February, 2017)
Here, we take the first steps in this direction and present a deep learning pipeline that takes as input images of the undeciphered Indus script, as found in archaeological artifacts, and returns as output a string of graphemes, suitable for inclusion in a standard corpus. The classifier can identify the presence or absence of the most frequent Indus grapheme, the "jar" sign, with an accuracy of 92%

Identifying Designs from Incomplete, Fragmented Cultural Heritage Objects by Curve-Pattern Matching (Jun Zhou - 5 January, 2017)
However, many objects, such as pottery sherds found in the archaeological record, are fragmentary, making the underlying complete designs unknowable at the scale of the sherd fragment. The challenge to reconstruct and study complete designs is stymied because 1) most fragmentary cultural-heritage objects contain only a small portion of the underlying full design, 2) in the case of a stamping application, the same design may be applied multiple times with spatial overlap on one object, and 3) curve patterns detected on an object are usually incomplete and noisy

Ceramics Fragments Digitization by Photogrammetry, Reconstructions and Applications (Jean-Baptiste Barreau - 3 December, 2014)
They provide answers to scientific needs in the fields of conservation, preservation, restoration and mediation of architectural, archaeological and cultural heritage [2] [6] [7] [9]. Photogrammetry on ceramic fragments was one of the first applications contemporary of the development of this technique applied in the archaeological community [3]. More recently and due to its democratization, it was applied more generally to artifacts [5]. Finally joined today by the rise of 3D printing [8] [10], it can restore fragmented artifacts [1] [12]

The morpho-topographic and cartographic analysis of the archaeological site Cornesti "Iarcuri", Timis County, Romania, using computer sciences methods (GIS and Remote Sensing techniques) (Dorel Micle - 9 June, 2009)
The archaeological site Cornesti "Iarcuri" is the largest earth fortification in Romania, made out of four concentric compounds, spreading over 1780 hectares. It is known since 1700, but it had only a few small attempts of systematic research, the fortress gained interest only after the publishing of some satellite images by Google Earth. Through our work we try not to date the site as this objective will be achieved only after completing the systematic excavations which started in 2007, but only to analyze the co-relationship with the environment.

Logographic Subword Model for Neural Machine Translation (Yihao Fang - 7 September, 2018)
Considering most of the logographic languages are ancient and very low resource languages, these advantages are very desirable for archaeological computational linguistic applications such as a resource-limited offline hand-held Demotic-English translator.

Real-time Monocular Visual Odometry for Turbid and Dynamic Underwater Environments (Maxime Ferrera - 3 July, 2018)

Evolutionary Model Discovery of Factors for Farm Selection by the Artificial Anasazi (Chathika Gunaratne - 1 February, 2018)
Our results confirm that, plot quality, dryness and community presence were more important in the farm selection process of the Anasazi than distance, and discover farm selection strategies that generate simulations that produce a closer fit to the archaeological data.

3D Reconstruction of Incomplete Archaeological Objects Using a Generative Adversarial Network (Renato Hermoza - 10 March, 2018)
We introduce a data-driven approach to aid the repairing and conservation of archaeological objects: ORGAN, an object reconstruction generative adversarial network (GAN). As archaeological objects can greatly differ between them, the network is conditioned on a variable, which can be a culture, a region or any metadata of the object

Curve-Structure Segmentation from Depth Maps: A CNN-based Approach and Its Application to Exploring Cultural Heritage Objects (Yuhang Lu - 22 November, 2017)
Motivated by the important archaeological application of exploring cultural heritage objects, in this paper we study the challenging problem of automatically segmenting curve structures that are very weakly stamped or carved on an object surface in the form of a highly noisy depth map

A New Approach to Reporting Archaeological Surveys: Connecting Rough Cilicia, Visible Past and Open Context through loose coupling and 3d codes (Sorin Adam Matei - 11 March, 2014)
The project presents the strategy adopted by the Rough Cilicia Archaeological Survey team for publishing its primary data and reports via three potentially transformative strategies for digital humanities: Loose coupling of digital data curation and publishing platforms. The Rough Cilicia Archaeological Survey, Visible Past, and Open Context work together to illustrate a new genre of scholarship, which combine qualitative narratives and quantitative representations of space and social phenomena
