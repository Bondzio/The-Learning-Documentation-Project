The 30-Year Cycle In The AI Debate (Jean-Marie Chauvet - 8 October, 2018)
Many existing tech companies -- including the giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft -- have opened new research labs. This paper reviews briefly the track-record in AI and Machine Learning and finds this pattern of early dramatic successes, followed by philosophical critique and unexpected difficulties, if not downright stagnation, returning almost to the clock in 30-year cycles since 1958.

Do Diffusion Protocols Govern Cascade Growth? (Justin Cheng - 18 May, 2018)

But regardless of mechanism, the cascades in our analysis all have a similar reproduction number ($\approx$ 1.8), meaning that lower rates of exposure can be offset with higher per-exposure rates of adoption

Bootstrapping incremental dialogue systems from minimal data: the generalisation power of dialogue grammars (Arash Eshghi - 22 September, 2017)
Our experiments show that our model can process 74% of the Facebook AI bAbI dataset even when trained on only 0.13% of the data (5 dialogues). It can in addition process 65% of bAbI+, a corpus we created by systematically adding incremental dialogue phenomena such as restarts and self-corrections to bAbI

Challenging Neural Dialogue Models with Natural Data: Memory Networks Fail on Incremental Phenomena (Igor Shalyminov - 22 September, 2017)
To answer this question, we created a new corpus called bAbI+ by systematically adding natural spontaneous incremental dialogue phenomena such as restarts and self-corrections to the Facebook AI Research's bAbI dialogues dataset. Finally, we go on to show that an incremental, semantic parser -- DyLan -- shows 100% semantic accuracy on both bAbI and bAbI+, highlighting the generalisation properties of linguistically informed dialogue models.

Identifying Subjective and Figurative Language in Online Dialogue (Stephanie M. Lukin - 28 August, 2017)
More and more of the information on the web is dialogic, from Facebook newsfeeds, to forum conversations, to comment threads on news articles. We aim to automatically identify sarcastic and nasty utterances in unannotated online dialogue, extending a bootstrapping method previously applied to the classification of monologic subjective sentences in Riloff and Weibe 2003. Our method is as follows: 1) Explore methods for identifying sarcastic and nasty cue words and phrases in dialogues; 2) Use the learned cues to train a sarcastic (nasty) Cue-Based Classifier; 3) Learn general syntactic extraction patterns from the sarcastic (nasty) utterances and define fine-tuned sarcastic patterns to create a Pattern-Based Classifier; 4) Combine both Cue-Based and fine-tuned Pattern-Based Classifiers to maximize precision at the expense of recall and test on unannotated utterances.

Really? Well. Apparently Bootstrapping Improves the Performance of Sarcasm and Nastiness Classifiers for Online Dialogue (Stephanie Lukin - 28 August, 2017)
More and more of the information on the web is dialogic, from Facebook newsfeeds, to forum conversations, to comment threads on news articles. The best performing classifier for the first phase achieves 54% precision and 38% recall for sarcastic utterances. We then use general syntactic patterns from previous work to create more general sarcasm indicators, improving precision to 62% and recall to 52%. Our first phase, using crowdsourced nasty indicators, achieves 58% precision and 49% recall, which increases to 75% precision and 62% recall when we bootstrap over the first level with generalized syntactic patterns.

'Dark Germany': Hidden Patterns of Participation in Online Far-Right Protests Against Refugee Housing (Sebastian Schelter - 24 July, 2017)
In order to contribute to the analysis of these processes, we present a quantitative study of the social media activities of a contemporary nationwide protest movement against local refugee housing in Germany, which organizes itself via dedicated Facebook pages per city. We analyse data from 136 such protest pages in 2015, containing more than 46,000 posts and more than one million interactions by more than 200,000 users. We find several activity metrics such as the number of posts issued, discussion volume about crime and housing costs, negative polarity in comments, and user engagement to peak in late 2015, coinciding with chancellor Angela Merkel's much criticized decision of September 2015 to temporarily admit the entry of Syrian refugees to Germany

Bias and high-dimensional adjustment in observational studies of peer effects (Dean Eckles - 14 June, 2017)
Here we show, in the context of information and media diffusion on Facebook, that high-dimensional adjustment of a nonexperimental control group (677 million observations) using propensity score models produces estimates of peer effects statistically indistinguishable from those from using a large randomized experiment (220 million observations). Naive observational estimators overstate peer effects by 320% and commonly used variables (e.g., demographics) offer little bias reduction, but adjusting for a measure of prior behaviors closely related to the focal behavior reduces bias by 91%. High-dimensional models adjusting for over 3,700 past behaviors provide additional bias reduction, such that the full model reduces bias by over 97%

As a proof of concept, we enumerate through a random pool of 1.16 million phone numbers. We found that social (69.2%) and spear (54.3%) phishing attacks are more successful than non-targeted phishing attacks (35.5%) on OTT messaging applications

Quis pendit ipsa pretia: facebook valuation and diagnostic of a bubble based on nonlinear demographic dynamics (Peter Cauwels - 1 November, 2011)
We illustrate the methodology with a detailed analysis of facebook, one of the biggest of the social-media giants. There is a clear signature of a change of regime that occurred in 2010 on the growth of the number of users, from a pure exponential behavior (a paradigm for unlimited growth) to a logistic function with asymptotic plateau (a paradigm for growth in competition). Using a discount factor of 5%, a profit margin of 29% and 3.5 USD of revenues per user per year yields a value of facebook of 15.3 billion USD in the base case scenario, 20.2 billion USD in the high growth scenario and 32.9 billion USD in the extreme growth scenario. According to our methodology, this would imply that facebook would need to increase its profit per user before the IPO by a factor of 3 to 6 in the base case scenario, 2.5 to 5 in the high growth scenario and 1.5 to 3 in the extreme growth scenario in order to meet the current, widespread, high expectations. To prove the wider applicability of our methodology, the analysis is repeated on Groupon, the well-known deal-of-the-day website which is expected to go public in November 2011

Usefulness of altmetrics for measuring the broader impact of research: A case study using data from PLOS (altmetrics) and F1000Prime (paper tags) (Lutz Bornmann - 16 February, 2015)
With respect to the "good for teaching" tag, the results from regression models were able to confirm these expectations: Papers with this tag show significantly higher Facebook and Twitter counts than papers without this tag. Conclusions: The results of the current study indicate that Facebook and Twitter, but not Figshare or Mendeley, can provide indications of papers which are of interest to a broader circle of readers (and not only for the peers in a specialist area), and seem therefore be useful for societal impact measurement.
