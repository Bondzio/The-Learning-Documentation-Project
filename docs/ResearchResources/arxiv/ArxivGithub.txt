An Initial Step Towards Organ Transplantation Based on GitHub Repository (Shangwen Wang - 10 October, 2018)
We analyze statistics from 12 representative GitHub projects and get the conclusion that 1) there are abundant practical organs existing in commits with add as a key word in the comments; 2) organs in this repository mainly possess four kinds of contents; 3) approximately 70% of the organs are easy-to-transplant. Implementing our transplantation strategy for different kinds of organs, we manually extract 30 organs in three different programming languages, namely Java, Python, and C, and make unit tests for them utilizing four testing tools (two for Java, one for Python, and one for C). All the 30 organs extracted by our strategy possess good performances in unit test with the highest passing rate reaching 97% and the lowest one still passing 80% and the three Java organs work well in the new system, providing three new functionalities for the host

SCC: Automatic Classification of Code Snippets (Kamel Alreshedy - 21 September, 2018)
Online forums such as Stack Overflow and code repositories such as GitHub contain a large number of code snippets. In this paper, we describe Source Code Classification (SCC), a classifier that can identify the programming language of code snippets written in 21 different programming languages. It is shown to achieve an accuracy of 75% which is higher than that with Programming Languages Identification (PLI a proprietary online classifier of snippets) whose accuracy is only 55.5%. The average score for precision, recall and the F1 score with the proposed tool are 0.76, 0.75 and 0.75, respectively. In addition, it can distinguish between code snippets from a family of programming languages such as C, C++ and C#, and can also identify the programming language version such as C# 3.0, C# 4.0 and C# 5.0.

Effective Reformulation of Query for Code Search using Crowdsourced Knowledge and Extra-Large Data Analytics (Mohammad Masudur Rahman - 23 July, 2018)
Software developers frequently issue generic natural language queries for code search while using code search engines (e.g., GitHub native search, Krugle). The semantic proximity has been determined by an analysis of 1.3 million questions and answers of Stack Overflow. Experiments using 310 code search queries report that our technique suggests relevant API classes with 48% precision and 58% recall which are 32% and 48% higher respectively than those of the state-of-the-art. Comparisons with two state-of-the-art studies and three popular search engines (e.g., Google, Stack Overflow, and GitHub native search) report that our reformulated queries (1) outperform the queries of the state-of-the-art, and (2) significantly improve the code search results provided by these contemporary search engines.

CORRECT: Code Reviewer Recommendation in GitHub Based on Cross-Project and Technology Experience (Mohammad Masudur Rahman - 9 July, 2018)
However, in GitHub, identifying an appropriate code reviewer for a pull request is a non-trivial task given that reliable information for reviewer identification is often not readily available. We first motivate our technique using an exploratory study with 10 commercial projects and 10 associated libraries external to those projects. Experiments using 17,115 pull requests from 10 commercial projects and six open source projects show that our technique provides 85%--92% recommendation accuracy, about 86% precision and 79%--81% recall in code reviewer recommendation, which are highly promising

To evaluate our approach, we mined a large set of over 6,000 popular libraries from Maven Central Repository and investigated their usage by over 38,000 client systems from the Github repository. Our experiments show that our technique is able to detect the majority (77%) of highly consistent and cohesive library usage patterns across a considerable number of client systems.

Using Temporal and Semantic Developer-Level Information to Predict Maintenance Activity Profiles (Stanislav Levin - 30 November, 2016)
This platform was used to create a metrics dataset based on processing nearly 1000 highly popular open source GitHub repositories, consisting of 147 million LOC, and maintained by 30,000 developers. Our results show both strong correlation and promising predictive power with R-squared values of 0.83, 0.64, and 0.75

Learning Python Code Suggestion with a Sparse Pointer Network (Avishkar Bhoopchand - 24 November, 2016)
We release a large-scale code suggestion corpus of 41M lines of Python code crawled from GitHub. By augmenting a neural language model with a pointer network specialized in referring to predefined classes of identifiers, we obtain a much lower perplexity and a 5 percentage points increase in accuracy for code suggestion compared to an LSTM baseline. In fact, this increase in code suggestion accuracy is due to a 13 times more accurate prediction of identifiers. Furthermore, a qualitative analysis shows this model indeed captures interesting long-range dependencies, like referring to a class member defined over 60 tokens in the past.

Accelerating Deep Convolutional Networks using low-precision and sparsity (Ganesh Venkatesh - 2 October, 2016)
We achieve the highest reported accuracy of 76.6% Top-1/93% Top-5 on the Imagenet object classification challenge with low-precision network\footnote{github release of the source code coming soon} while reducing the compute requirement by ~3x compared to a full-precision network that achieves similar accuracy. Furthermore, to fully exploit the benefits of our low-precision networks, we build a deep learning accelerator core, dLAC, that can achieve up to 1 TFLOP/mm^2 equivalent for single-precision floating-point operations (~2 TFLOP/mm^2 for half-precision).

To mitigate both issues, we propose a novel (and automated) approach for estimating TF-values, which we execute against a corpus of 133 popular project in GitHub. Among others, we find that the majority of our target systems (65%) have TF <= 2. Surveying developers from 67 target systems provides confidence towards our estimates; in 84% of the valid answers we collect, developers agree or partially agree that the TF's authors are the main authors of their systems; in 53% we receive a positive or partially positive answer regarding our estimated truck factors.

Can we find Stack Overflow snippets in real projects? When snippets are used, is this copy literal or does it suffer adaptations? And are these adaptations specializations required by the idiosyncrasies of the target artifact, or are they motivated by specific requirements of the programmer? The large-scale study presented on this paper analyzes 909k non-fork Python projects hosted on Github, which contain 290M function definitions, and 1.9M Python snippets captured in Stack Overflow. Results are presented as quantitative analysis of block-level code cloning intra and inter Stack Overflow and GitHub, and as an analysis of programming behaviors through the qualitative analysis of our findings.

Continuous integration in a social-coding world: Empirical evidence from GitHub. **Updated version with corrections** (Bogdan Vasilescu - 6 December, 2015)
In GitHub development one can distinguish between two types of developer contributions to a project: direct ones, coming from a typically small group of developers with write access to the main project repository, and indirect ones, coming from developers who fork the main repository, update their copies locally, and submit pull requests for review and merger. In this paper we explore how GitHub developers use continuous integration as well as whether the contribution type (direct versus indirect) and different project characteristics (e.g., main programming language, or project age) are associated with the success of the automatic builds.
