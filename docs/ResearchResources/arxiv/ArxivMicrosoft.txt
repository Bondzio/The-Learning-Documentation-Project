The 30-Year Cycle In The AI Debate (Jean-Marie Chauvet - 8 October, 2018)
Many existing tech companies -- including the giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft -- have opened new research labs. This paper reviews briefly the track-record in AI and Machine Learning and finds this pattern of early dramatic successes, followed by philosophical critique and unexpected difficulties, if not downright stagnation, returning almost to the clock in 30-year cycles since 1958.

SciTokens: Capability-Based Secure Access to Remote Scientific Data (Alex Withers - 12 July, 2018)

By improving the interoperability and security of scientific workflows, SciTokens 1) enables use of distributed computing for scientific domains that require greater data protection and 2) enables use of more widely distributed computing resources by reducing the risk of credential abuse on remote systems.

Maximum Value Matters: Finding Hot Topics in Scholarly Fields (Jinghao Zhao - 18 October, 2017)
Given the compromised effectiveness of such predictions, in this paper we use a real scholarly dataset from Microsoft Academic Graph, which provides more than 12000 topics in the field of Computer Science (CS), including 1200 venues, 14.4 million authors, 30 million papers and their citation relations over the period of 1950 till now. Aiming to find the topics that will trend in CS area, we innovatively formalize a hot topic prediction problem where, with joint consideration of both inter- and intra-topical influence, 17 different scientific features are extracted for comprehensive description of topic status. By leveraging all those 17 features, we observe good accuracy of topic scale forecasting after 5 and 10 years with R2 values of 0.9893 and 0.9646, respectively. Interestingly, our prediction suggests that the maximum value matters in finding hot topics in scholarly fields, primarily from three aspects: (1) the maximum value of each factor, such as authors' maximum h-index and largest citation number, provides three times the amount of information than the average value in prediction; (2) the mutual influence between the most correlated topics serve as the most telling factor in long-term topic trend prediction, interpreting that those currently exhibiting the maximum growth rates will drive the correlated topics to be hot in the future; (3) we predict in the next 5 years the top 100 fastest growing (maximum growth rate) topics that will potentially get the major attention in CS area.

Microsoft's ADAM and Google's DistBelief results did not reach 30 % validation accuracy for Imagenet 22K. Compared to Facebook AI Research's recent paper on 256 GPU training, we use a different communication algorithm, and our combined software and hardware system offers better communication overhead for Resnet-50. A PowerAI DDL enabled version of Torch completed 90 epochs of training on Resnet 50 for 1K classes in 50 minutes using 64 IBM Power8 S822LC servers (256 GPUs).

However, when only use of code smells based metrics were used for prediction (without basic set of metrics), such process resulted with surprisingly high accuracy (0.8249) and F-measure (0.8286) results

English Conversational Telephone Speech Recognition by Humans and Machines (George Saon - 6 March, 2017)
This then raises two issues - what IS human performance, and how far down can we still drive speech recognition error rates? A recent paper by Microsoft suggests that we have already achieved human performance. We also report on our own efforts in this area, presenting a set of acoustic and language modeling techniques that lowered the word error rate of our own English conversational telephone LVCSR system to the level of 5.5%/10.3% on the Switchboard/CallHome subsets of the Hub5 2000 evaluation, which - at least at the writing of this paper - is a new performance milestone (albeit not at what we measure to be human performance!). On the acoustic side, we use a score fusion of three models: one LSTM with multiple feature inputs, a second LSTM trained with speaker-adversarial multi-task learning and a third residual net (ResNet) with 25 convolutional layers and time-dilated convolutions

The problem statement provided an annual scoring mechanism for institutions based on their publications and encouraged the use of any publicly available dataset such as the Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG). The contest was focused on research publications in selected conferences and asked for a prediction of the ranking for active institutions within those conferences in 2016. Each team's final ranking list was evaluated by a metric called NDCG@20 after the results were released. After computing the scores of institutions for each year starting from 2011, we aggregated the rankings by summing the normalized scores across the years and using the final score set to provide the final ranking. Since the 2016 ground truths were unknown, we utilized the scores from 2011-2014 and used the 2015 publications as a test bed for evaluating our aggregation method. Based on the testing, summing the normalized scores got us closest to the actual 2015 rankings and using same heuristic for predicting the 2016 results.

On using the Microsoft Kinect$^{\rm TM}$ sensors in the analysis of human motion (M. J. Malinowski - 27 May, 2015)
The present paper aims at providing the theoretical background required for investigating the use of the Microsoft Kinect$^{\rm TM}$ (`Kinect', for short) sensors (original and upgraded) in the analysis of human motion. The data acquisition may involve commercially-available treadmills and a number of velocity settings: for instance, walking-motion data may be acquired at $5$ km/h, running-motion data at $8$ and $11$ km/h

XML Schema-based Minification for Communication of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems in Cloud Environments (Bishoy Moussa - 3 October, 2014)
This technique is applied to Intrusion Detection Message Exchange Format (IDMEF) messages, as part of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system communication hosted on Microsoft Azure Cloud. Test results show message size reduction ranging from 8.15% to 50.34% in the raw message, without using time-consuming compression techniques. Adding GZip compression to the proposed technique produces 66.1% shorter message size compared to original XML messages.

About the size of Google Scholar: playing the numbers (Enrique OrduÃ±a-Malea - 5 September, 2014)
The emergence of academic search engines (Google Scholar and Microsoft Academic Search essentially) has revived and increased the interest in the size of the academic web, since their aspiration is to index the entirety of current academic knowledge. The main objective of this working paper is to calculate the size of Google Scholar at present (May 2014). To do this, we present, apply and discuss up to 4 empirical methods: Khabsa & Giles's method, an estimate based on empirical data, and estimates based on direct queries and absurd queries. The results, despite providing disparate values, place the estimated size of Google Scholar in about 160 million documents
