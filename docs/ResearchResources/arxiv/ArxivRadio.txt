Classification Algorithms for Semi-Blind Uplink/Downlink Decoupling in sub-6 GHz/mmWave 5G Networks (Hatim Chergui - 5 September, 2018)
Reliability and latency challenges in future mixed sub-6 GHz/millimeter wave (mmWave) fifth generation (5G) cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks is to guarantee a fast radio resource management in both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL), while tackling the corresponding propagation imbalance that may arise in blockage situations. In this context, we introduce a semi-blind UL/DL decoupling concept where, after its initial activation, the central processing unit (CPU) gathers measurements of the Rician $K$-factor---reflecting the line-of-sight (LOS) condition of the user equipment (UE)---as well as the DL reference signal receive power (RSRP) for both 2.6 GHz and 28 GHz frequency bands, and then train a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The CPU finally stops the measurements of mmWave definitely, and apply the trained SVM algorithm on the 2.6 GHz data to blindly predict the target frequencies and access points (APs) that can be independently used for the UL and DL. The accuracy score of the proposed classifier reaches $95\%$ for few training samples.

The extensive simulation results then clearly show that the proposed solution achieves higher throughputs, i.e., up to 50%, than that of conventional methods.

Analytical Models of the Performance of C-V2X Mode 4 Vehicular Communications (Manuel Gonzalez-Martin - 17 July, 2018)
In Mode 4, vehicles autonomously select and manage their radio resources without any cellular infrastructure support. Mode 4 is highly relevant since V2V safety applications cannot depend on the availability of infrastructure-based cellular coverage. This paper presents a set of novel analytical models of the communication performance of C-V2X or LTE-V Mode 4. In particular, the paper presents analytical models for the average PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) as a function of the distance between transmitter and receiver, and for the four different types of transmission errors that can be encountered in C-V2X or LTE-V Mode 4. To this aim, this study compares the results obtained with the analytical models to those obtained with a C-V2X or LTE-V Mode 4 simulator implemented by the authors over the Veins simulation platform. To the authors' knowledge, the models presented in this paper are the first to analytically model the communication performance of C-V2X or LTE-V Mode 4.

Two types of harmonic-summing approaches are investigated in this paper: 1) storing intermediate data in off-chip memory and 2) processing the input signals directly without storing. For the second type, two approaches of caching data are proposed and evaluated: 1) preloading points that are frequently touched 2) preloading all necessary points that are used to generate a chunk of output points. While in raw performance a single FPGA board cannot compete with a GPU, in terms of energy dissipation, GPU costs up to 2.6x times more energy than that of FPGAs in executing the same NDRange kernels.

Results show that the channel loss is strongly dependent on the termination impedance at the receiver end, with up to 4dB variation in average loss for different termination in an oscilloscope and an additional 9 dB channel loss with wearable prototype compared to an oscilloscope measurement.

RF-PUF: Enhancing IoT Security through Authentication of Wireless Nodes using In-situ Machine Learning (Baibhab Chatterjee - 18 June, 2018)
Traditional authentication in radio-frequency (RF) systems enable secure data communication within a network through techniques such as digital signatures and hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC), which suffer from key recovery attacks. State-of-the-art IoT networks such as Nest also use Open Authentication (OAuth 2.0) protocols that are vulnerable to cross-site-recovery forgery (CSRF), which shows that these techniques may not prevent an adversary from copying or modeling the secret IDs or encryption keys using invasive, side channel, learning or software attacks. Simulation results involving the process variations in a standard 65 nm technology node, and features such as LO offset and I-Q imbalance detected with a neural network having 50 neurons in the hidden layer indicate that the framework can distinguish up to 4800 transmitters with an accuracy of 99.9% (~ 99% for 10,000 transmitters) under varying channel conditions, and without the need for traditional preambles.

Due its cost-efficiency, the latter has contributed the most; cell towers used to be 10 km apart and are now only 100 m apart in urban areas. While rigid frequency planning was originally used to alleviate inter-cell interference, the interference is becoming a major bottleneck as we densify the networks [2], because each cell is then hit by non-negligible interference from many neighboring cells.

Comparing Radio Propagation Channels Between 28 and 140 GHz Bands in a Shopping Mall (Sinh Le Hong Nguyen - 26 December, 2017)
In this paper, we compare the radio propagation channels characteristics between 28 and 140 GHz bands based on the wideband (several GHz) and directional channel sounding in a shopping mall environment. Our results reveal that there is high spatial-temporal correlation between 28 and 140 GHz channels, similar numbers of strong multipath components, and only small variations in the large-scale parameters between the two bands. Furthermore, when including the weak paths there are higher total numbers of clusters and paths in 28 GHz as compared to those in 140 GHz bands. With these similarities, it would be very interesting to investigate the potentials of using 140 GHz band in the future mobile radio communications.

Recently in [1], a framework has been introduced by generating a dataset using GNU radio that mimics the imperfections in a real wireless channel, and uses 10 different modulation types. Here, we follow the framework of [1] and find deep neural network architectures that deliver higher accuracy than the state of the art. We tested the architecture of [1] and found it to achieve an accuracy of approximately 75% of correctly recognizing the modulation type. We first tune the CNN architecture of [1] and find a design with four convolutional layers and two dense layers that gives an accuracy of approximately 83.8% at high SNR. We then develop architectures based on the recently introduced ideas of Residual Networks (ResNet [2]) and Densely Connected Networks (DenseNet [3]) to achieve high SNR accuracies of approximately 83.5% and 86.6%, respectively. Finally, we introduce a Convolutional Long Short-term Deep Neural Network (CLDNN [4]) to achieve an accuracy of approximately 88.5% at high SNR.

Where, When, and How mmWave is Used in 5G and Beyon (Kei Sakaguchi - 26 April, 2017)
Since the next generation network is not just a new radio access standard, but instead an integration of networks for vertical markets with diverse applications, answers to the question depend on scenarios and use cases to be deployed. The paper starts with 28 GHz outdoor backhauling for fixed wireless access and moving hotspots, which will be demonstrated at the PyeongChang winter Olympic games in 2018. The second deployment example is a 60 GHz unlicensed indoor access system at the Tokyo-Narita airport, which is combined with Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) to enable ultra-high speed content download with low latency

The proposed two localization approaches, DML and $k$ nearest neighbors based on reconstructed radio map (reKNN), were shown to achieve less than 4.3\ m and 3.7\ m mean localization error respectively in a typical office environment with an area of approximately 170\ m$^2$, while the unsupervised localization with perturbation algorithm was shown to achieve 4.7\ m mean localization error with 8 times more workload than the proposed methods. As for the room level localization application, both DML and reKNN can meet the requirement with at most 9\ m of localization error which is enough to tell apart different rooms with over 99\% accuracy.

On the Deployment of Distributed Antennas for Wireless Power Transfer with Safety Electromagnetic Radiation Level Requirement (Chao Zhang - 7 March, 2017)

First, the minimum antenna height of DA-PB is derived to make the radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation power density at any location of the charging cell lower than the SERL published by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Second, the closed-form expressions of average harvested Direct Current (DC) power per user in the charging cell for pass-loss exponent 2 and 4 are also provided. In order to maximize the average efficiency of WPT, the optimal radii for distributed antennas elements (DAEs) are derived when the pass-loss exponent takes the typical value $2$ and $4$

Large-Scale Cloud Radio Access Networks with Practical Constraints: Asymptotic Analysis and Its Implications (Kyung Jun Choi - 8 August, 2016)
Large-scale cloud radio access network (LS-CRAN) is a highly promising next-generation cellular network architecture whereby lots of base stations (BSs) equipped with a massive antenna array are connected to a cloud-computing based central processor unit via digital front/backhaul links. This paper studies an asymptotic behavior of downlink (DL) performance of a LS-CRAN with three practical constraints: 1) limited transmit power, 2) limited front/backhaul capacity, and 3) limited pilot resource. Specifically, as higher UL transmit power is provided, more users can be associated and the data rate per user can be increased simultaneously while keeping the order-optimality as long as the total front/backhaul overhead is $Î©(N^{Î·_{\rm{bs}}+Î·_{\rm{ant}}+Î·_{\rm{user}}+\frac{2}Î±Ï^{\rm{ul}}})$ and $Î©(N^{Î·_{\rm{user}}-Î·_{\rm{bs}}})$ pilot resources are available

In contrast to the previous works on convex but non-smooth sparsity inducing approaches, e.g., the group sparse beamforming algorithm based on the mixed l1/l2-norm relaxation [1], we adopt the nonconvex but smoothed lp-minimization (0 < p <= 1) approach to promote sparsity in the multicast setting, thereby enabling efficient algorithm design based on the principle of the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm and the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique

The Gain of Network Coding in Wireless Sensor Networking (Pierre Brunisholz - 8 December, 2014)
Wireless Sensor Networks have some well known features such as low battery consumption, changing topology awareness, open environment, non reliable radio links, etc.In this paper, we investigate the benefits of Network Coding Wireless Sensor networking, especially resiliency.One of our main concern is the resiliency in Wireless Sensor Networks.We have seen that resiliency could be described as a multi dimensional metric \cite{5478822,erdene2011enhancing,6423640} taking parameters such as Average Delivery Ratio, Delay Efficiency, Energy Efficiency, Average Throughput and Delivery Fairness into account.Resiliency can then be graphically represented as a kiviat diagram created by the previous weighted parameters.In order to introduce these metrics, previous works have been leaded on the Random Gradient Based Routing, which proved good resiliency in malicious environment.We look for seeing the improvements in term of resiliency, when adding network coding in the Random Gradient Based Routing with malicious nodes.

Scalable Wake-up of Multi-Channel Single-Hop Radio Networks (Bogdan S. Chlebus - 4 August, 2015)
There are $n$ stations connected to $b$ radio channels that do not provide collision detection. We give a deterministic scalable algorithm for the special case when $b>d \log \log n$, for some constant $d>1$, which wakes up the network in $O(\frac{k}{b}\log n\log(b\log n))$ time, with $k$ unknown. We give a randomized algorithm that wakes up the network within $O(k^{1/b}\ln \frac{1}Îµ)$ rounds with a probability that is at least $1-Îµ$, for any $0<Îµ<1$, where $k$ is known. For this model, we give two deterministic algorithms for unknown~$k$: one wakes up the network in time $O(\log^{-1}(\frac{1}{p})\, k\log n\log^{1/b} k)$, and the other in time $O(\log^{-1}(\frac{1}{p}) \, \frac{k}{b} \log n\log(b\log n))$ but assuming the inequality $b>\log(128b\log n)$, both with a probability that is at least $1-1/\mbox{poly}(n)$.

The ergodic capacity gain from the RRH density is larger than that from the number of antennas per RRH,which indicates that the association number of the RRH should not be bigger than 4 to balance the performance gain and the implementation cost.

An Asymptotically Efficient Backlog Estimate for Dynamic Frame Aloha (Luca Barletta - 4 May, 2013)
In this paper we investigate backlog estimation procedures for Dynamic Frame Aloha (DFA) in Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) environment. Although in the latter case efficiency $e^{-1}$ is possible, none of the solution proposed in the literature has been shown to reach such value. We analyze Schoute's backlog estimate, which is very attractive for its simplicity, and formally show that its asymptotic efficiency is 0.311. Leveraging the analysis, we propose the Asymptotic Efficient backlog Estimate (AE$^2$) an improvement of the Schoute's backlog estimate, whose efficiency reaches $e^{-1}$ asymptotically. We further show that AE$^2$ can be optimized in order to present an efficiency very close to $e^{-1}$ for practically any value of the population size. We also evaluate the loss of efficiency when the frame size is constrained to be a power of two, as required by RFID standards for DFA, and theoretically show that the asymptotic efficiency becomes 0.356.

This paper reports an implementation of the PHY specifications of the IEEE 802.15.4 standard for the frequency band 868 915 MHz on a Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. Several hardware PHY 868/915 MHz band IEEE 802.15.4 transceiver implementations have been already reported on ASIC and FPG [1] [2].

Low Delay MAC Scheduling for Frequency-agile Multi-radio Wireless Networks (Avhishek Chatterjee - 17 February, 2013)
In this paper, we propose MAXIMALGAIN MAC, a distributed MAC scheduler for frequency agile multi-band networks that simultaneously achieves the following: (i) optimal network-delay scaling with respect to the number of communicating pairs, (ii) low computational complexity of O(log2(maximum degree of the interference graphs)) which is independent of the number of frequency bands, number of radios per node, and overall size of the network, and (iii) robustness, i.e., it can be adapted to a scenario where nodes are not synchronized and control packets could be lost. Due to a recent impossibility result, optimal delay-scaling could only be achieved with some amount of throughput loss [30]. Extensive simulations using OMNeT++ network simulator shows that, compared to a multi-band extension of a state-of-art CSMA algorithm (namely, Q-CSMA), our asynchronous algorithm achieves a 2.5x? reduction in delay while achieving at least 85% of the maximum achievable throughput

Finite Horizon Adaptive Optimal Distributed Power Allocation for Enhanced Cognitive Radio Network in the Presence of Channel Uncertainties (Hao Xu - 6 February, 2013)
Therefore, a novel finite horizon adaptive optimal distributed power allocation scheme is proposed by incorporating the effect of channel uncertainties for enhanced cognitive radio network in the presence of wireless channel uncertainties under two cases. In Case 1, proposed scheme can force the Signal-to-interference (SIR) of the secondary users to converge to a higher target value for increasing network throughput when primary users' are not communicating within finite horizon. Once primary users are activated as in the Case 2, proposed scheme can not only force the SIR of primary users to converge to a higher target SIR, but also force the SIR of secondary users to converge to a lower value for regulating their interference to Pus during finite time period

As a simple corollary, $4 k + 2$ is upper bound the number of keys outside $[K', K"]$ that will ever be received. In unreliable network the expected number of efforts to receive such frames is bounded by $(8 k + 4) / p + 2 (1 - p) / p^2$, where $p$ is probability of successful reception, and the reception rate of the requested frames is $p$ -- the highest possible

Difference Antenna Selection and Power Allocation for Wireless Cognitive Systems (Yue Wang - 15 October, 2010)
In this paper, we propose an antenna selection method in a wireless cognitive radio (CR) system, namely difference selection, whereby a single transmit antenna is selected at the secondary transmitter out of $M$ possible antennas such that the weighted difference between the channel gains of the data link and the interference link is maximized. The optimization is performed over two parameters: the peak secondary transmit power and the difference selection weight $Î´\in [0, 1]$

Collaborative Spectrum Sensing from Sparse Observations in Cognitive Radio Networks (Jia Meng - 25 August, 2010)
Specifically, equipped with a frequency selective filter, each cognitive radio node senses linear combinations of multiple channel information and reports them to the fusion center, where occupied channels are then decoded from the reports by using novel matrix completion and joint sparsity recovery algorithms. In particular, in small-scale networks, the matrix completion approach achieves exact channel detection with a number of samples no more than 50% of the number of channels in the network, while joint sparsity recovery achieves similar performance in large-scale networks.

Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio with Quantized Channel Information (Yuan Yuan He - 3 June, 2010)
It is assumed that a band manager or a cognitive radio service provider has access to the full CSI information from the secondary and primary receivers and designs (offline) an optimal power codebook based on the statistical information (channel distributions) of the channels and feeds back the index of the codebook to the secondary transmitter for every channel realization in real-time, via a delay-free noiseless limited feedback channel. Numerical studies illustrate that with only 3-4 bits of feedback, the modified GLA based algorithms provide secondary ergodic capacity very close to that achieved by full CSI and with only as little as 4 bits of feedback, AQPA provides a comparable performance, thus making it an attractive choice for practical implementation.

Concurrent Channel Probing and Data Transmission in Full-duplex MIMO Systems (Zhenzhi Qian - 30 May, 2017)
Our approach is based on the key observation that using Full-duplex radios, when the base-station (BS) is collecting CSI of one user through the uplink channel, it can use the downlink channel to simultaneously transmit data to other (non-interfering) users for which CSIs are already known. By allowing concurrent channel probing and data transmission, our scheme can potentially achieve a higher throughput compared to traditional schemes using Half-duplex radios
