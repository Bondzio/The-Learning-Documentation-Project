Opportunistic Downlink Interference Alignment for Multi-Cell MIMO Networks (Hyun Jong Yang - 6 January, 2017)
Simulation results show that the ODIA significantly outperforms existing interference management techniques in terms of sum-rate in realistic cellular environments. Note that the ODIA operates in a non-collaborative and decoupled manner, i.e., it requires no information exchange among BSs and no iterative beamformer optimization between BSs and users, thus leading to an easier implementation.

Opportunistic Downlink Interference Alignment (Hyun Jong Yang - 18 April, 2014)
Simulation results show that the ODIA significantly outperforms existing interference management techniques in terms of sum-rate in realistic cellular environments. Note that the ODIA operates in a distributed and decoupled manner, while requiring no information exchange among BSs and no iterative beamformer optimization between BSs and users, thus leading to an easier implementation.
