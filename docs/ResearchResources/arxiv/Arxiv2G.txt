Universal abelian variety and Siegel modular forms (Shouhei Ma - 10 October, 2018)

Regolith behavior under asteroid-level gravity conditions: low-velocity impact experiments (Julie Brisset - 2 October, 2018)
In a 10-2g environment (Lunar g levels), only embedding of the impactor was observed and ejecta production was produced for most impacts at > 20 cm/s. In these microgravity conditions, ejecta started to be produced for impacts at > 10 cm/s. When projectile rebound occurred, we observed that its coefficients of restitution on the bed of regolith simulant decrease by a factor of 10 with increasing impact speeds from ~5 cm/s up to 100 cm/s

The Hubble Space Telescope UV Legacy Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters. XVI. The helium abundance of multiple populations (A. P. Milone - 13 September, 2018)
We compare multi-wavelength HST photometry with synthetic spectra to determine for the first time the average helium difference between the 2G and 1G stars in a large sample of 57 GCs and the maximum helium variation within each of them. The maximum helium variation ranges from less than 0.01 to more than 0.10 in helium mass fraction and correlates with both the cluster mass and the color extension of the horizontal branch (HB)

On Computing the Multiplicity of Cycles in Bipartite Graphs Using the Degree Distribution and the Spectrum of the Graph (Ali Dehghan - 5 October, 2018)
Second, using counter-examples, we demonstrate that the information of the degree distribution and the spectrum of a bi-regular bipartite graph is, in general, insufficient to count the cycles of length $i \geq 2g$. We demonstrate that the same negative result also holds true for half-regular bipartite graphs, and is also applicable to counting $g$-cycles for $g \geq 6$ and $g \geq 8$, in irregular and half-regular graphs, respectively. As positive results, we compute the number of $4$-cycles and $6$-cycles in irregular and half-regular bipartite graphs, with $g \geq 4$ and $g \geq 6$, respectively, using only the degree distribution and the spectrum of the graph.

Subdominant $d$-wave interaction in superconducting CaKFe$_4$As$_2$? (Daniel Jost - 30 May, 2018)
In $B_{1g}$ symmetry the difference between normal and superconducting state is most pronounced, and the feature is shifted downwards with respect to those in $A_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ symmetry. The maximum peaking at 134 cm$^{-1}$ (16.6 meV) has a substructure on the high-energy side. We interpret the peak at 134 cm$^{-1}$ in terms of a collective Bardasis-Schrieffer (BS) mode and the substructure as a remainder of the pair-breaking feature on the electron bands. There is a very weak peak at 50 cm$^{-1}$ (6.2 meV) which is tentatively assigned to another BS mode.

High Tc superconductivity in CaKFe$_4$As$_4$ in absence of nematic fluctuations (W. -L. Zhang - 18 April, 2018)
The B$_{2g}$ symmetry Raman response shows no signatures of Pomeranchuk-like electronic nematic fluctuations which is observed for many other Fe-based superconductors. In the superconducting state, we identify three pair-breaking peaks at 13.8, 16.9 and 21 meV and full spectral weight suppression at low energies. The pair-breaking peak energies in Raman response are about 20% lower than twice the gap energies as measured by single-particle spectroscopy, implying a sub-dominant $d$-wave symmetry interaction

Phase diagram description of the CaCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ double perovskite (Ivon R. Buitrago - 16 April, 2018)
We include all $3d$-Fe orbitals: $t_{2g}$ localized orbitals, with spin 3/2 and magnetically coupled, plus two degenerate itinerant $e_g$ orbitals with local and nearest-neighbor (NN) electron correlations, and hopping between NN $e_g$ orbitals of the same symmetry. Allub and Alascio previously proposed a model to describe the phase transition in LaCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ from a paramagnetic-metal to an antiferromagnetic-insulator, induced by temperature or pressure, involving charge transfer between Fe and Cu ions, in contrast to Fe-charge disproportionation. With the model proposed for CaCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$, modified to account for this difference between the two compounds, the density of states of the itinerant Fe orbitals was obtained, using Green's functions methods. The phase diagram for CaCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ was calculated, including phases exhibiting Fe-charge disproportionation, where the two eg orbitals in each site are symmetrically occupied, as well as novel phases exhibiting local orbital selectivity/asymmetric occupation of $e_g$ orbitals. We determined the model parameters which best describe the phase transition observed in CaCu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$, and found other phases at different parameter ranges, which might be relevant for other compounds of the ACu$_3$Fe$_4$O$_{12}$ family, which present both types of transitions.

Large Genus Asymptotics for Volumes of Strata of Abelian Differentials (Amol Aggarwal - 4 July, 2018)
Through a combinatorial analysis of an algorithm proposed in 2002 by Eskin-Okounkov to exactly evaluate these quantities, we show that the volume $Î½_1 \big( \mathcal{H}_1 (m) \big)$ of a stratum indexed by a partition $m = (m_1, m_2, \ldots , m_n)$ is $\big( 4 + o(1) \big) \prod_{i = 1}^n (m_i + 1)^{-1}$ as $2g - 2 = \sum_{i = 1}^n m_i$ tends to $\infty$. This confirms a prediction of Eskin-Zorich and generalizes some of the recent results of Chen-Moeller-Zagier and Sauvaget, who established these limiting statements in the special cases $m = 1^{2g - 2}$ and $m = (2g - 2)$, respectively.

Equivariant Euler characteristics of $\overline{\mathscr{M}}_{g, n}$ (Adrian Diaconu - 22 March, 2018)
Let $\overline{\mathscr{M}}_{g, n}$ be the moduli space of $n$-pointed stable genus $g$ curves, and let $\mathscr{M}_{g, n}$ be the moduli space of $n$-pointed smooth curves of genus $g.$ In this paper, we obtain an asymptotic expansion for the characteristic of the free modular operad $\mathbb{M}\mathcal{V}$ generated by a stable $\mathbb{S}$-module $\mathcal{V},$ allowing to effectively compute $\mathbb{S}_{n}$-equivariant Euler characteristics of $\overline{\mathscr{M}}_{g, n}$ in terms of $\mathbb{S}_{n'}$-equivariant Euler characteristics of $\mathscr{M}_{g'\!, n'}$ with $0\le g' \le g,$ $\textrm{max}\{0, 3 - 2g' \} \le n' \le 2(g - g') + n.$ This answers a question posed by Getzler and Kapranov by making their integral representation of the characteristic of the modular operad $\mathbb{M}\mathcal{V}$ effective. To illustrate how the asymptotic expansion is used, we give formulas expressing the generating series of the $\mathbb{S}_{n}$-equivariant Euler characteristics of $\overline{\mathscr{M}}_{g, n},$ for $g = 0, 1$ and $2,$ in terms of the corresponding generating series associated with $\mathscr{M}_{g, n}.$

We generalize the previous exact results of the Nagaoka-type itinerant ferromagnetic states in a three dimensional $t_{2g}$-orbital system to allow for multiple holes. In the strong coupling limit of $U\to \infty$, the orbital-generalized Nagaoka ferromagnetic states are proved degenerate with the ground state in the thermodynamic limit when the hole number per orbital layer scales slower than $L^{\frac{1}{2}}$. This result is valid for arbitrary values of the ferromagnetic Hund's coupling $J>0$ and inter-orbital repulsion $V\ge 0$

Cohomology of symplectic groups and Meyer's signature theorem (Dave Benson - 13 October, 2017)
Meyer showed that the signature of a closed oriented surface bundle over a surface is a multiple of $4$, and can be computed using an element of $H^2(\mathsf{Sp}(2g, \mathbb{Z}),\mathbb{Z})$. Denoting by $1 \to \mathbb{Z} \to \widetilde{\mathsf{Sp}(2g,\mathbb{Z})} \to \mathsf{Sp}(2g,\mathbb{Z}) \to 1$ the pullback of the universal cover of $\mathsf{ Sp}(2g,\mathbb{R})$, Deligne proved that every finite index subgroup of $\widetilde{\mathsf {Sp}(2g, \mathbb{Z})}$ contains $2\mathbb{Z}$. As a consequence, a class in the second cohomology of any finite quotient of $\mathsf{Sp}(2g, \mathbb{Z})$ can at most enable us to compute the signature of a surface bundle modulo $8$. There is a central extension $1\to \mathbb{Z}/2\to\tilde{\mathfrak{H}}\to\mathfrak{H}\to 1$, and $\tilde{\mathfrak{H}}$ appears as a quotient of the metaplectic double cover $\mathsf{Mp}(2g,\mathbb{Z})=\widetilde{\mathsf{Sp}(2g,\mathbb{Z})}/2\mathbb{Z}$. Provided $g\ge 4$, $\widetilde{\mathfrak{H}}$ is the universal central extension of $\mathfrak{H}$. Putting all this together, we provide a recipe for computing the signature modulo $8$, and indicate some consequences.

Radiation enhancement and "temperature" in the collapse regime of gravitational scattering (Dimitri Colferai - 29 September, 2017)

The resulting graviton spectrum, tuned on the gravitational radius $R$, fully agrees with previous calculations for small angles $Î_s\ll 1$ but, for sizeable angles $Î_s(b)\leq Î_c = O(1)$ acquires an exponential cutoff of the large $ÏR$ region, due to energy conservation, so as to emit a finite fraction of the total energy. In the approach-to-collapse regime of $b\to b_c^+$ we find a radiation enhancement due to large tidal forces, so that the whole energy is radiated off, with a large multiplicity $\langle N \rangle\sim Gs \gg 1$ and a well-defined frequency cutoff of order $R^{-1}$.

Double Gravitational Wave Mergers (Johan Samsing - 22 August, 2018)

We find that the probability for observing both GW mergers is only notable for co-planar interactions with low GW kicks ($\lesssim 10^{1}-10^{2}$ kms$^{-1}$), which suggests that double GW mergers can be used to probe environments facilitating such interactions

2004 TT357: A potential contact binary in the Trans-Neptunian belt (Audrey Thirouin - 31 July, 2017)

Considering a single triaxial ellipsoid in hydrostatic equilibrium, we derive a lower limit to the density of 0.78g cm$^{-3}$, and an elongation (a/b) of 2.01 assuming an equatorial view. From Hubble Space Telescope data, we report no resolved companion orbiting 2004 TT$_{357}$. Despite an expected high fraction of contact binaries in the trans-Neptunian belt, 2001 QG$_{298}$ is the unique confirmed contact binary in the trans-Neptunian belt, and 2004 TT$_{357}$ is only the second candidate to this class of systems, with 2003 SQ$_{317}$.

The Chern number $\mathcal{C}=-1$, generated by the manifold of Os $t_{2g}$ bands crossing the Fermi energy, signifies the presence of a single chiral edge state in nanoribbons of finite width, where we further show that edge states are spatially narrower for zigzag than armchair edges and investigate edge-state transport in the presence of vacancies at Os sites. Since $5d$ electrons of Os exhibit {\em both} strong SOC and moderate correlation effects, we employ DFT+U calculations to show how increasing on-site Coulomb repulsion $U$: gradually reduces $E_g$ while maintaining $\mathcal{C} = -1$ for $0 < U < U_c$; leads to metallic phase with $E_g = 0$ at $U_c$; and opens the gap of topologically trivial Mott insulating phase with $\mathcal{C}=0$ for $U > U_c$.

Cherenkov and Scintillation Light Separation in Organic Liquid Scintillators (J. Caravaca - 5 December, 2017)
The CHErenkov / Scintillation Separation experiment (CHESS) has been used to demonstrate the separation of Cherenkov and scintillation light in both linear alkylbenzene (LAB) and LAB with 2g/L of PPO as a fluor (LAB/PPO). A time resolution of 338 +/- 12 ps FWHM results in an efficiency for identifying Cherenkov photons in LAB/PPO of 70 +/- 3% and 63 +/- 8% for time- and charge-based separation, respectively, with scintillation contamination of 36 +/- 5% and 38 +/- 4%. LAB/PPO data is consistent with a rise time of 0.75 +/- 0.25 ns.

Influence of the ferroelectric quantum critical point on SrTiO$_3$ interfaces (W. A. Atkinson - 30 September, 2016)
We study a model SrTiO$_3$ interface in which conduction $t_{2g}$ electrons couple to the ferroelectric (FE) phonon mode. We treat the FE mode within a self-consistent phonon theory that captures its quantum critical behavior, and show that proximity to the quantum critical point leads to universal tails in the electron density of the form $n(z) \sim (Î»+z)^{-2}$, where $Î»\sim T^{2-d/\mathfrak{z}}$, with $d=3$ the dimensionality and $\mathfrak{z}=1$ the dynamical critical exponent

Zeros of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions in the hyperelliptic ensemble (Hung M. Bui - 23 May, 2016)
We study the $1$-level density and the pair correlation of zeros of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions in function fields, as we average over the ensemble $\mathcal{H}_{2g+1}$ of monic, square-free polynomials with coefficients in $\mathbb{F}_q[x]$. In the case of the $1$-level density, when the Fourier transform of the test function is supported in the restricted interval $(\frac{1}{3},1)$, we compute a secondary term of size $q^{-\frac{4g}{3}}/g$, which is not predicted by the Ratios Conjecture. For example, if the Fourier transform is supported in $(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2})$, we identify another lower order term of size $q^{-\frac{8g}{5}}/g$. We also compute the pair correlation, and as for the $1$-level density, we detect lower order terms under certain restrictions; for example, we see a term of size $q^{-g}/g^2$ when the Fourier transform is supported in $(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2})$. The $1$-level density and the pair correlation allow us to obtain non-vanishing results for $L(\frac12,Ï_D)$, as well as lower bounds for the proportion of simple zeros of this family of $L$-functions.

Instead we find that the total electron density in the $d-p$ states is smaller, $n=29-x<n_0$ ($x>0$). When we fix $x=1$, the predictions for the $d-p$ model become more realistic and weakly insulating antiferromagnetic ground state with the moments lying within IrO$_2$ planes along (110) direction is found, in agreement with experiment and \textit{ab initio} data

Ultra-High Cooperativity Interactions between Magnons and Resonant Photons in a YIG sphere (Jeremy Bourhill - 25 April, 2016)
The largest observed coupling between photons and magnons is $2g/2Ï=7.11$ GHz for a 15.5 GHz mode, corresponding to a cooperativity of $C=1.51\pm0.47\times10^7$. Complex modifications beyond a simple multi-oscillator model, of the photon mode frequencies were observed between 0 and 0.1 Tesla. Between 0.4 to 1 Tesla, degenerate resonant photon modes were observed to interact with magnon spin wave resonances with different couplings strengths, indicating time reversal symmetry breaking due to the gyrotropic permeability of YIG. By comparing measured mode frequencies at 7 Tesla with Finite Element modelling, a bare dielectric permittivity of $15.96\pm0.02$ of the YIG crystal has been determined at about $20$ mK.

I also achieved the qualitative agreement with several experiments of Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ or Sr$_{2}$Ru$_{0.975}$Ti$_{0.025}$O$_{4}$

Improving the error term in the mean value of $L(\tfrac{1}{2},Ï)$ in the hyperelliptic ensemble (Alexandra Florea - 12 May, 2015)
Summing $L(1/2,Ï_D)$ over monic, square-free polynomials $D$ of degree $2g+1$, the main term is of size $|D| \log_q |D|$ (where $|D|=q^{2g+1}$) and Andrade and Keating bound the error term by $|D|^{\frac 34+ \frac{\log_q(2)}{2}}$.

CogCell: Cognitive Interplay between 60GHz Picocells and 2.4/5GHz Hotspots in the 5G Era (Kishor Chandra - 7 May, 2015)
Legacy 2G--4G systems covering large areas were envisioned to serve both indoor and outdoor environments. However, in the 5G-era, 80\% of overall traffic is expected to be generated in indoors. We envision 60\,GHz mmWave picocell architecture to support high-speed indoor and hotspot communications. We envisage the 5G indoor network as a combination of-, and interplay between, 2.4/5\,GHz having robust coverage and 60\,GHz links offering high datarate. We propose 60\,GHz picocellular network architecture, called CogCell, leveraging the ubiquitous WiFi. We propose to use 60\,GHz for the data plane and 2.4/5GHz for the control plane. The hybrid network architecture considers an opportunistic fall-back to 2.4/5\,GHz in case of poor connectivity in the 60\,GHz domain. Further, to avoid the frequent re-beamforming in 60\,GHz directional links due to mobility, we propose a cognitive module -- a sensor-assisted intelligent beam switching procedure -- which reduces the communication overhead

Signatures of nematic quantum critical fluctuations in the Raman spectra of lightly doped cuprates (S. Caprara - 6 May, 2015)
We find that the longitudinal nematic fluctuations peaked at zero transferred momentum account well for the anomalous Raman absorption observed in these systems in the $B_{2g}$ channel, while the absence of such effect in the $B_{1g}$ channel may be due to the overall suppression of Raman response at low frequencies, associated with the pseudogap. While in Y$_{0.97}$Ca$_{0.03}$BaCuO$_{6.05}$ the low-frequency lineshape is fully accounted by longitudinal nematic collective modes alone, in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ also charge-ordering modes with finite characteristic wavevector are needed to reproduce the shoulders observed in the Raman response

Arithmetic properties of the Frobenius traces defined by a rational abelian variety (with two appendices by J-P. Serre) (Alina Carmen Cojocaru - 21 April, 2016)
Let $A$ be an abelian variety over $\mathbb{Q}$ of dimension $g$ such that the image of its associated absolute Galois representation $Ï_A$ is open in $\operatorname{GSp}_{2g}(\hat{\mathbb{Z}})$. We investigate the arithmetic of the traces $a_{1, p}$ of the Frobenius at $p$ in $\operatorname{Gal}(\overline{\mathbb{Q}}/\mathbb{Q})$ under $Ï_A$, modulo varying primes $p$. In particular, we obtain upper bounds for the counting function $\#\{p \leq x: a_{1, p} = t\}$ and we prove an ErdÃ¶s-Kac type theorem for the number of prime factors of $a_{1, p}$. We also formulate a conjecture about the asymptotic behaviour of $\#\{p \leq x: a_{1, p} = t\}$, which generalizes a well-known conjecture of S. Trotter from 1976 about elliptic curves.

Unquenched $e_g^1$ orbital moment in the Mott insulating antiferromagnet KOsO4 (Young-Joon Song - 9 December, 2014)

In contrast to conventional wisdom that the $e_g$ complex will not support orbital magnetism, we find that for the easy axis [100] direction the substantial Os orbital moment $M_L\approx-0.2 Î¼_B$ compensates half of the Os spin moment $M_S$ = 0.4$Î¼_B$. The origin of the orbital moment is analyzed and understood in terms of additional spin-orbital lowering of symmetry, and beyond that due to structural distortion, for magnetization along [100]

Orbital-resolved vortex core states in FeSe Superconductors: calculation based on a three-orbital model (Q. E. Wang - 15 June, 2015)
We study electronic structure of vortex core states of FeSe superconductors based on a t$_{2g}$ three-orbital model by solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes(BdG) equation self-consistently. Isotropic $s$ and anisotropic $s$ wave vortices have $G_5$ symmetry for each orbital, whereas $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave vortices show $G^{*}_{6}$ symmetry for $d_{xz/yz}$ orbitals and $G^{*}_{5}$ symmetry for $d_{xy}$ orbital. In the case of $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave vortices, hybridized-pairing between $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals gives rise to a relative phase difference in terms of gauge transformed pairing order parameters between $d_{xz/yz}$ and $d_{xy}$ orbitals, which is essentially caused by a transformation of co-representation of $G^{*}_{5}$ and $G^{*}_{6}$ subgroup. The phase difference of $\fracÏ{4}$ between $d_{xz/yz}$ and $d_{xy}$ orbital-resolved $d_{x^2-y^2}$ wave vortices can be verified by further experiment observation.

Moreover, for any nonnegative integer $g$ we construct a $2$-connected equimatchable factor-critical graph with genus $g$ and more than $4\sqrt{2g}$ vertices, which establishes that the maximum size of such graphs is $Î(\sqrt g)$. Finally, for any nonnegative integers $g$, $h$ and $k$ we provide a construction of arbitrarily large $2$-connected equimatchable bipartite graphs with orientable genus $g$, respectively nonorientable genus $h$, and a genus embedding with face-width $k$.

Ground state of S=1 zigzag spin-orbital chain (Hiroaki Onishi - 30 October, 2013)
We investigate ground-state properties of a $t_{\rm 2g}$-orbital Hubbard model on a zigzag chain relevant for CaV$_{2}$O$_{4}$, by exploiting numerical techniques such as Lanczos diagonalization and density-matrix renormalization group. Assuming a V$^{3+}$ ion, a local spin $S$=$1$ state is formed by two electrons in the $t_{\rm 2g}$ orbitals

Excitonic Magnetism in Van Vleck-type d^4 Mott Insulators (Giniyat Khaliullin - 1 November, 2013)
In Mott insulators with the t^4_{2g} electronic configuration such as of Re^{3+}, Ru^{4+}, Os^{4+}, and Ir^{5+} ions, spin-orbit coupling dictates a Van Vleck-type nonmagnetic ground state with angular momentum J=0, and the magnetic response is governed by gapped singlet-triplet excitations. In perovskites, a conventional Bose condensation of excitons into a magnetic state is found, while an unexpected one-dimensional behavior supporting spin-liquid states emerges in honeycomb lattices, due to the bond-directional nature of exciton interactions in the case of 90 degree d-p-d bonding geometry.

This is a natural generalization of the case of genus 1. Due to a technical problem, our consideration is at present restricted to the case that g(g+1)divided by 2 is odd. Example calculations are shown for the genus 2 by the method described here.

Origin of the Heavy Fermion Behavior in Ca_{2-x}Sr_{x}RuO_{4}: Roles of Coulomb Interaction and the Rotation of RuO_{6} octahedra (Naoya Arakawa - 25 September, 2012)
We study the electronic states for Ca_{2-x}Sr_{x}RuO_{4} in $0.5\leq x \leq 2$ within the Gutzwiller approximation (GA) on the basis of the three-orbital Hubbard model for the Ru t_{2g} orbitals. Using the numerical minimization of the energy obtained in the GA, we obtain the renormalization factor (RF) of the kinetic energy and total RF, which estimates the inverse of the mass enhancement, for three cases with the effective models of x=2 and 0.5 and a special model. Our calculation suggests that the heavy fermion behavior around x=0.5 comes from the cooperative effects between moderately strong Coulomb interaction compared to the total bandwidth and the modification of the electronic structures due to the rotation of RuO_{6} octahedra (i.e., the variation of the $dpÏ$ hybridizations and the downward shift for the $d_{xy}$ orbital). We propose that moderately strong electron correlation and the orbital-dependent modifications of the electronic structures due to the lattice distortions play important roles in the electronic states for Ca_{2-x}Sr_{x}RuO_{4}.

Phase Spaces for asymptotically de Sitter Cosmologies (William R. Kelly - 13 August, 2012)
Furthermore, we identify an interesting algebra (even larger than the ASG) containing two Virasoro algebras related by a reality condition and having imaginary central charges $\pm i \frac{3\ell}{2G}$. Along the way we show that, despite the lack of local degrees of freedom, the $d=3, k=-1$ phase space is non-trivial even in pure $Î> 0$ Einstein-Hilbert gravity due to the existence of a family of `wormhole' solutions labeled by their angular momentum, a mass-like parameter $Î¸_0$, the topology of future infinity ($I^+$), and perhaps additional internal moduli. These solutions are $Î> 0$ analogues of BTZ black holes and exhibit a corresponding mass gap relative to empty de Sitter.

Surface-enhanced Raman scattering of SnO$_{2}$ bulk material and colloidal solutions (Enza Fazio - 8 December, 2011)
Raman spectra are characterized by the three Raman scattering peaks at 478, 633, and 776 \invcm, assigned to the E$_g$, A$_{1g}$ and B$_{2g}$ modes, typical of rutile SnO$_2$. In presence of the silver nanoparticles, in addition to the enhancement intensity of some of the fundamental tin dioxide rutile Raman features, the appearance of a new Raman scattering peak at about 600 cm$^{-1}$ is observed. In particular, the appearance of a peak near 600 \invcm is attributed to the Raman activation of the infrared E$_u$ transverse optical (TO) mode.

Spin-orbit coupled systems in the "atomic" limit: rhenates, osmates, iridates (Arun Paramekanti - 11 June, 2018)
Motivated by RIXS experiments on a wide range of complex heavy oxides, including rhenates, osmates, and iridates, we discuss the theory of RIXS for site-localized $t_{2g}$ orbital systems with strong spin-orbit coupling. Using ab initio electronic structure calculations on Ba$_2$${\cal M}$ReO$_6$ (with ${\cal M}$=Re, Os, Ir) we show that while the atomic limit yields a reasonable effective Hamiltonian description of the experimental observations, effects such as $t_{2g}$-$e_g$ interactions and hybridization with oxygen are important

However, the pseudogap is strongly anisotropic in momentum space, where the magnitude of the pseudogap around the nodes is smaller than that around the antinodes, which leads to that the low-energy spectral weight of the B_{1g} spectrum is suppressed heavily by the pseudogap, while the pseudogap has a more modest effect on the electronic Raman response in the B_{2g} orientation.

Improving Air Interface User Privacy in Mobile Telephony (Mohammed Shafiul Alam Khan - 13 April, 2015)
Although the security properties of 3G and 4G mobile networks have significantly improved by comparison with 2G (GSM), significant shortcomings remain with respect to user privacy. A number of possible modifications to 2G, 3G and 4G protocols have been proposed designed to provide greater user privacy; however, they all require significant modifications to existing deployed infrastructures, which are almost certainly impractical to achieve in practice

Coupled nonpolar-polar metal-insulator transition in 1:1 SrCrO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ superlattices: A first-principles study (Yuanjun Zhou - 22 February, 2015)

The insulating character is shown to arise from Cr $t_{2g}$ orbital ordering, which is produced by an in-plane polar distortion that couples to the superlattice d-bands and is stabilized by epitaxial strain

Linear chord diagrams on two intervals (JÃ¸rgen E. Andersen - 28 October, 2010)

Earlier work had already determined that the analogous generating function ${\bf C}_g(z)=z^{2g}R_g(z)/(1-4z)^{3g-{1\over 2}}$ for chords attached to a single interval is algebraic, for $g\geq 1$, where the polynomial $R_g(z)$ with degree at most $g-1$ has integer coefficients and satisfies $R_g(1/4)\neq 0$ in analogy to the generating function ${\bf C}_0(z)$ for the Catalan numbers. The new results here on ${\bf C}_g^{[2]}(z)$ rely on this earlier work, and indeed, we find that $R_g^{[2]}(z)=R_{g+1}(z) -z\sum_{g_1=1}^g R_{g_1}(z) R_{g+1-g_1}(z)$, for $g\geq 1$.

In the channel of electron-hole excitations we find universal behavior in B$_{2g}$ symmetry as long as the material exhibits superconductivity at low temperature. In contrast, there is a strong doping dependence in B$_{1g}$ symmetry: (i) In the doping range $0.20 \le p \le 0.25$ we observe rapid changes of shape and temperature dependence of the spectra. (ii) In La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$ new structures appear for $x < 0.13$ which are superposed on the electron-hole continuum. For $x \le 0.05$ the response from fluctuations disappears at B$_{1g}$ and appears at B$_{2g}$ symmetry in full agreement with the orientation change of stripes found by neutron scattering. While, with a grain of salt, the particle-hole continuum is universal for all cuprates the response from fluctuating charge order in the range $0.05 \le p < 0.16$ is so far found only in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_{x}$CuO$_4$

A Message-Passing Algorithm for Counting Short Cycles in a Graph (Mehdi Karimi - 22 April, 2010)
For bipartite graphs, which are of particular interest in coding, the algorithm is capable of counting cycles of length g, g +2,..., 2g - 2, where g is the girth of the graph. For a general (non-bipartite) graph, cycles of length g; g + 1, ..., 2g - 1 can be counted

Substitutional doping of Cu in diamond: Mott physics with $p$ orbitals (H. Hassanian Arefi - 7 April, 2010)
Our extensive first principle calculations averaged over various geometries based on density functional theory, indicates the formation of a mid-gap band, which mainly arises from the $t_{2g}$ and $4p$ states of Cu. For impurity concentrations of more than $\sim 1%, the effect of $2p$ bands of neighboring carbon atoms can be ignored. Increasing the concentration of the Cu impurity beyond $\sim 5%, completely closes the spectral gap of the host diamond.

Inverse scattering at fixed energy on surfaces with Euclidean ends (Colin Guillarmou - 2 April, 2010)
The topological condition is given by $N\geq\max(2g+1,2)$ for $j=1$ and by $N\geq g+1$ if $j=2$. In $\rr^2$ this implies that the operator $S_V(\la)$ determines any $C^{1,Î±}$ potential $V$ such that $V(z)=O(e^{-Î³|z|^2})$ for all $Î³>0$.

Deformed Topological Partition Function and Nekrasov Backgrounds (I. Antoniadis - 14 March, 2010)
These terms generate physical amplitudes involving two anti-self-dual Riemann tensors, 2g-2 anti-self-dual graviphoton field strengths and 2n self-dual field strengths from the matter vector multiplets. This has been computed in [1] and in the field theory limit shown to be given by the radius deformation of c=1 CFT coupled to two-dimensional gravity

Many-body large polaron optical conductivity in SrTi$_{1-x}$Nb$_x$O$_3$ (J. T. Devreese - 4 March, 2010)
The {theoretical approach takes into account} many-body effects, the electron-phonon interaction with multiple LO-phonon branches, and the degeneracy and the anisotropy of the Ti t$_{2g}$ conduction band. {Based on the FrÃ¶hlich interaction, the many-body large-polaron theory} provides an interpretation for the essential characteristics, except -- interestingly -- for the unexpectedly large intensity of a peak at $\sim130$ meV, of the observed optical conductivity spectra of SrTi$_{1-x}$Nb$_{x}$O$_{3}$ \textit{without} any adjustment of material parameters.

Parametrized Abel-Jacobi maps and abelian cycles in the Torelli group (Thomas Church - 5 August, 2011)
In 1983 Johnson constructed a beautiful family of invariants tau_i: H_i(I_g,*) -> /\^{i+2} H for 0 <= i <= 2g-2, using a kind of Abel-Jacobi map for families, in order to detect nontrivial cycles in I_g,*. Johnson proved that tau_1 is an isomorphism rationally, and asked if the same is true for tau_i with i > 1.

A note on cabling and L-space surgeries (Jennifer Hom - 20 December, 2009)
We prove that the (p,q)-cable of a knot K in S^3 admits a positive L-space surgery if and only if K admits a positive L-space surgery and q/p \geq 2g(K)-1, where g(K) is the Seifert genus of K

Discrete Dirac Operators, Critical Embeddings and Ihara-Selberg Functions (Martin Loebl - 15 January, 2015)
We show that the generating function for the even subsets of edges of G, i.e., the Ising partition function, is a linear combination of the square roots of 2^{2g} Ihara-Selberg functions I(D(s)(x)) also called Feynman functions. By a result of Foata--Zeilberger holds I(D(s)(x))= det(I-D'(s)(x)), where D'(s)(x) is obtained from D(s)(x) by replacing some entries by 0

Raman signature of the U(1) Dirac spin-liquid state in spin-1/2 kagome system (Wing-Ho Ko - 1 February, 2010)
In the ensuing calculations on the spin-1/2 kagome lattice, we found that the Raman intensity profile in the E_g channel is invariant under an arbitrary rotation in the kagome plane, and that in all (A_{1g}, E_g, and A_{2g}) symmetry channels the Raman intensity profile contains broad continua that display power-law behaviors at low energy, with exponent approximately equal to 1 in the A_{2g} channel and exponent approximately equal to 3 in the E_g and the A_{1g} channels

On some moduli spaces of bundles on K3 surfaces, II (C. G. Madonna - 15 August, 2010)
We give many examples in which there exist infinitely many divisorial conditions on the moduli space of polarized K3 surfaces $(S,H)$ of degree $H^2=2g-2$, $g \geq 3$, and Picard number $rk N(S)=Ï(S)=2$ such that for a general K3 surface $S$ satisfying these conditions the moduli space of sheaves $M_S(r,H,s)$ is birationally equivalent to the Hilbert scheme $S[g-rs]$ of zero-dimensional subschemes of $S$ of lenght equal to $g-rs$. This result generalizes the main result of \cite{Nik1} when $g=rs+1$ and of \cite{Monat} when $r=s=2$, $g \geq 5$.
