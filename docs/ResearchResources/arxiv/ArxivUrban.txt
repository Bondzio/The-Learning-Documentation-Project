MobInsight: A Framework Using Semantic Neighborhood Features for Localized Interpretations of Urban Mobility (Souneil Park - 29 September, 2017)
In this paper, we present MobInsight, a framework for making localized interpretations of urban mobility that reflect various aspects of the urbanism

Big IoT and social networking data for smart cities: Algorithmic improvements on Big Data Analysis in the context of RADICAL city applications (Evangelos Psomakelis - 2 July, 2016)
A large set of city applications in the areas of Participating Urbanism, Augmented Reality and Sound-Mapping throughout participating cities is being applied, resulting into produced sets of millions of user-generated events and online SN reports fed into the RADICAL platform

Visualising Emotional Landmarks in Cities (Salvatore Iaconesi - 17 December, 2014)
In this paper we will present a series of these types of visualizations, and the ways in which they can be used to gain better understandings of these emotional patterns as they arise, from points of view which derive from anthropology, urbanism, sociology, politics and also arts and poetics. A reflection on possible usage cases for anthropology, urbanism, policy-making, arts and design will end the contribution, as well as the description of series of open issues and the indication of possible next-steps for research.

Urban DNA for cities evolutions. Cities as physical expression of dynamic equilibriums between competitive and cooperative forces (Luca D&#39;Acci - 26 October, 2015)
This mechanism, called Isobenefit Urbanism, is not static and pre-designed, but allows infinitely dynamic changes and expansions. Rather than describing The ideal city, which doesn't exist outside our own minds, Isobenefit Urbanism describes what a city should avoid to be in order to not become an unideal city

Communication of Social Agents and the Digital City - A Semiotic Perspective (Victor V. Kryssanov - 25 May, 2006)
First, a functional analysis of a digital city is made in the light of the modern study of urbanism; similarities between the virtual and urban constructions are pointed out
