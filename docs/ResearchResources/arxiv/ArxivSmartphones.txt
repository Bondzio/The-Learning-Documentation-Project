PhotoSafer: Content-Based and Context-Aware Private Photo Protection for Smartphones (Ang Li - 1 October, 2018)
Coarse-grained access control systems such as the Android permission system offer all-or-nothing access to photos stored on smartphones, and users are unaware of the exact behavior of installed apps. Our analysis finds that 82% of the top 200 free apps in a popular Android app store have complete access to stored photos and network on a user's smartphone, which indicates possible private photo leakage. In addition, our user survey reveals that 87.5% of the 112 respondents are not aware that certain apps can access their photos without informing users, and all the respondents believe that the stored photos on their smartphones contain different types of private information

Mining Device-Specific Apps Usage Patterns from Large-Scale Android Users (Huoran Li - 27 July, 2017)
When smartphones, applications (a.k.a, apps), and app stores have been widely adopted by the billions, an interesting debate emerges: whether and to what extent do device models influence the behaviors of their users? The answer to this question is critical to almost every stakeholder in the smartphone app ecosystem, including app store operators, developers, end-users, and network providers. The data set covers the detailed behavioral profiles of 0.7 million (761,262) unique users who use 500 popular types of Android devices and about 0.2 million (228,144) apps, including their app management activities, daily network access time, and network traffic of apps

360-degree videos: a new visualization technique for astrophysical simulations (Christopher M. P. Russell - 21 July, 2017)
Video sharing sites such as YouTube now allow this unique content to be shared via virtual reality (VR) goggles, hand-held smartphones/tablets, and computers. Creating 360$^\circ$ videos from astrophysical simulations is not only a new way to view these simulations as you are immersed in them, but is also a way to create engaging content for outreach to the public. We present what we believe is the first 360$^\circ$ video of an astrophysical simulation: a hydrodynamics calculation of the central parsec of the Galactic centre. We also describe how to create such movies, and briefly comment on what new science can be extracted from astrophysical simulations using 360$^\circ$ videos.

Validation of a smartphone app to map social networks of proximity (Tjeerd W. Boonstra - 5 December, 2017)
While most studies have handed out specially programmed smartphones to study participants, we developed an application for iOS and Android to collect Bluetooth data from participants own smartphones. Proximity data was collected for 4 weeks. A contingency table revealed a significant association between proximity data (rho = 0.17, p<0.0001), but the marginal odds were higher for the app (8.6%) than for the badges (1.3%), indicating that dyads were more often detected by the app. All three networks were significantly correlated, although the correlation with self-reported data was lower for the app (rho = 0.25) than for badges (rho = 0.67)

Correlations Between Human Mobility and Social Interaction Reveal General Activity Patterns (Anders Mollgaard - 29 November, 2017)
Going beyond diurnal cycles, a central question is: to what extent do individuals act according to patterns shared across an entire population? Here we investigate the interplay between different activity types, namely communication, motion, and physical proximity by analyzing data collected from smartphones distributed among 638 individuals. We explore two central questions: Which underlying principles govern the formation of the activity patterns? Are the patterns specific to each individual or shared across the entire population? We find that statistics of the entire population allows us to successfully predict 71\% of the activity and 85\% of the inactivity involved in communication, mobility, and physical proximity

Comparing Speech and Keyboard Text Entry for Short Messages in Two Languages on Touchscreen Phones (Sherry Ruan - 16 January, 2018)
With the ubiquity of mobile touchscreen devices like smartphones, two widely used text entry methods have emerged: small touch-based keyboards and speech recognition. To discover both methods' "upper-bound performance," we evaluated them in English and Mandarin Chinese on an Apple iPhone 6 Plus in a laboratory setting. Our experiment was carried out using Baidu's Deep Speech 2, a deep learning-based speech recognition system, and the built-in Qwerty (English) or Pinyin (Mandarin) Apple iOS keyboards. We found that with speech recognition, the English input rate was 2.93 times faster (153 vs. 52 WPM), and the Mandarin Chinese input rate was 2.87 times faster (123 vs. 43 WPM) than the keyboard for short message transcription under laboratory conditions for both methods. Furthermore, although speech made fewer errors during entry (5.30% vs. 11.22% corrected error rate), it left slightly more errors in the final transcribed text (1.30% vs. 0.79% uncorrected error rate)

Leveraging subjects' own smartphones makes it possible to scale up and extend the duration of these types of studies, but at the same time introduces a substantial challenge: to preserve a smartphone's battery, GPS can be active only for a small portion of the time, frequently less than $10\%$, leading to a tremendous missing data problem. We conclude that our imputation approach better mirrors human mobility both theoretically and over a sample of GPS mobility traces from 182 individuals in the Geolife data set, where, relative to linear interpolation, imputation resulted in a 10-fold reduction in the error averaged across all mobility features.

In a tertile classification problem, basic dimensionality reduction techniques, such as independent component analysis, increase the predictability relative to the baseline from $11\%$ to $23\%$. Finally, from a supervised linear classifier, we were able to further improve this predictability to $33\%$. In addition, our findings indicate that the score system underlying the Big Five Inventory disregards a part of the information available in the 44 questions.
