A methodology to Evaluate the Usability of Security APIs (Chamila Wijayarathna - 11 October, 2018)
Increasing number of cyber-attacks demotivate people to use Information and Communication Technology (ICT) for industrial as well as day to day work. By conducting a review of previous research, we identified 5 usability evaluation methodologies that have been proposed to evaluate the usability of general APIs and characteristics of those methodologies that would affect when using these methodologies to evaluate security APIs

On the structure of the set of algebraic elements in a Banach algebra and their liftings (E. Makai, Jr. - 4 July, 2018)
Then all connected components of $S_p(A)$ are pathwise connected (locally pathwise connected), via a path of the form $e^{-ic_mt}\dots e^{-ic_1t} ae^{ic_1t}\dots e^{ic_mt}$, where $c_i = c_i^*$, and $t \in [0, 1]$ (of the form $e^{-ict} ae^{ict}$, where $c = c^*$, and $t \in [0,1]$). For (self-adjoint) idempotents we have by these old papers that the distance of different connected components of them is at least~$1$. For $E_p(A)$, $S_p(A)$ we pose the problem if the distance of different connected components is at least $\min \bigl\{|Î»_i - Î»_j| \mid 1 \leq i,j \leq n, \ i \neq j\bigr\}$

Early Discovery of Chronic Non-attenders by Using NFC Attendance Management System (Takumi Ichimura - 8 April, 2018)
Recently, the attendance management system (AMS) with RFID technology has been developed as a part of Smart University, which is the educational infrastructure using high technologies, such as ICT. The Android OS 2.3 and the later can provide access to NFC functionality. Therefore, we developed AMS for university with NFC on Nexus 7. Because Nexus 7 is a low cost smart tablet, a teacher can determine to use familiarly. Especially, this paper describes the method of early discovery for chronic non-attenders by using the AMS system on 2 or more Nexus 7 which is connected each other via peer-to-peer communication. The attendance situation collected from different Nexus 7 is merged into a SQLite file and then, the document is reported to operate with the trunk system in educational affairs section.

Evolution equations from an epistemic treatment of time (Per Ãstborn - 20 July, 2018)
For a free object we can write $\frac{d}{dÏ}Î¨(r_{4},Ï)=\frac{ic^{2}\hbar}{2\langle Îµ\rangle}\BoxÎ¨(r_{4},Ï)$, where $r_{4}=(r,ict)$. The squared rest energy $Îµ_{0}^{2}$ is proportional to the eigenvalue $\tildeÏ$ that describes a 'stationary state' $Î¨(r_{4},Ï)=Ï(r_{4},\tildeÏ)e^{i\tildeÏÏ}$. The Dirac equation follows as a `square root' of the stationary state equation from the condition that $\tildeÏ>0$, which is a consequence of the directed nature of $n$

Nevertheless, the spatial distributions of land use computed for different samples are remarkably robust: on average, we observe more than 75% of shared surface area between the different spatial partitions when considering activity of at least 100,000 users whatever the scale. The OD matrix is less stable and depends on the scale with a share of at least 75% of commuters in common when considering all types of flows constructed from the home-work locations of 100,000 users

Efficient generation of twin photons at telecom wavelengths with 10 GHz repetition-rate tunable comb laser (Rui-Bo Jin - 10 September, 2014)
These photons are conventionally generated by spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC), which is a probabilistic process, and hence occurs at a limited rate, which restricts wider applications of Q-ICT. To increase the rate, one had to excite SPDC by higher pump power, while it inevitably produced more unwanted multi-photon components, harmfully degrading quantum interference visibility.Here we solve this problem by using recently developed 10 GHz repetition-rate-tunable comb laser, combined with a group-velocity-matched nonlinear crystal, and superconducting nanowire single photon detectors. They operate at telecom wavelengths more efficiently with less noises than conventional schemes, those typically operate at visible and near infrared wavelengths generated by a 76 MHz Ti Sapphire laser and detected by Si detectors

Addressing this requirement, in this work we focus on four system properties: (i) elasticity of the cloud service, to accommodate large variations in the amount of service requested, (ii) performance isolation between the tenants of shared cloud systems, (iii) availability of cloud services and systems, and the (iv) operational risk of running a production system in a cloud environment.Focusing on key metrics, for each of these properties we review the state-of-the-art, then select or propose new metrics together with measurement approaches

The Impact of New Technologies in Public Financial Management and Performance: Agenda for Public Financial Management Reformance in the Context of Global Best Practices (Amos David - 5 December, 2008)
Therefore, the impact of ICT in public financial management will be felt only if the decision-makers and the end-users of the services engage themselves in the success of the system. Instead of giving a catalog of services, the focus has been on the model (or methodology) to adopt in designing services for which ICT could enhance the implementation.

Information Societies and Digital Divides (Bernardo Sorj - 17 July, 2008)
Therefore understanding the digital divide demands a broader discussion of the place of ICT within each society and in the international system. The author argues against the perspectives that either isolates ICT from other basic social goods (in particular education and employment) as well as those that argue that new technologies are luxury of a consumer society
