Towards realistic HPC models of the neuromuscular system (Chris Bradley - 9 February, 2018)
By using a detailed biophysics-based, chemo-electromechanical skeletal muscle model and the international open-source software library OpenCMISS as an example, we present an approach to upgrade an existing muscle simulation framework from a moderately parallel version towards a massively parallel one that scales both in terms of problem size and in terms of the number of parallel processes. We improve the overall runtime by a factor of up to 2.6 and achieved good scalability on up to 768 cores, where the previous implementation used only 4 cores.

Computer Simulation of Neural Networks Using Spreadsheets: The Dawn of the Age of Camelot (Serhiy O. Semerikov - 29 June, 2018)
After analyzing a collection of writings of 1890-1950, the research determines the role of the scientific journal "Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics", its founder Nicolas Rashevsky and the scientific community around the journal in creating and developing models and methods of computational neuroscience

Integration of nanoscale memristor synapses in neuromorphic computing architectures (Giacomo Indiveri - 27 February, 2013)
In this paper, we first review the neuro- and neuromorphic-computing approaches that can best exploit the properties of memristor and-scale devices, and then propose a novel hybrid memristor-CMOS neuromorphic circuit which represents a radical departure from conventional neuro-computing approaches, as it uses memristors to directly emulate the biophysics and temporal dynamics of real synapses

Information capacity in the weak-signal approximation (Lubomir Kostal - 12 August, 2010)
Since many model systems described in mathematical neuroscience and biophysics operate in the high noise regime and weak-signal conditions, we believe, that the described results are of potential interest also to researchers in these areas.
