Revealing Hidden Connections in Recommendation Networks (Rogerio Minhano - 22 June, 2016)
Starting from a set of users, called seeders, we crawled Google's Orkut and collected about 20 million users and 80 million relationships

Understanding Co-evolution in Large Multi-relational Social Networks (Ayush Singhal - 10 July, 2014)
The proliferation of online media such as Twitter, Facebook, Orkut and MMORPGs\footnote{Massively Multi-player Online Role Playing Games} have created social networking data at an unprecedented scale. Sony's Everquest 2 is one such example. We find that co-evolution rates in trust based `communities' are approximately $60\%$ higher than the trade based `communities'

A Multilayered Approach to Estimate Business Performance (Abhinov Balagoni - 14 October, 2014)
The usage of Web 2.0 tools, such as Wikipedia, blogs and social networking services such as Facebook, LinkedIn, Orkut by individuals in all societies, has been pervasive and very successful in proliferating their use at the professional or business levels

Toward Understanding Friendship in Online Social Networks (Dmitry Zinoviev - 26 February, 2009)
All major on-line social networks, such as MySpace, Facebook, LiveJournal, and Orkut, are built around the concept of friendship. It is not uncommon for a social network participant to have over 100 friends

Postmortem Analysis of Decayed Online Social Communities: Cascade Pattern Analysis and Prediction (Mohammed Abufouda - 10 October, 2018)
Recently, many online social networks, such as MySpace, Orkut, and Friendster, have faced inactivity decay of their members, which contributed to the collapse of these networks

A Theoretical Model for Understanding the Dynamics of Online Social Networks Decay (Mohammed Abufouda - 5 October, 2016)
However, not all of social networks achieved the desired growth, for example, online social networks like MySpace, Orkut, and Friendster are out of service today

Latent Space Model for Multi-Modal Social Data (Yoon-Sik Cho - 18 October, 2015)
We perform experiments with a variety of multi-modal social systems, spanning location-based social networks (Gowalla), social media services (Instagram, Orkut), e-commerce and review sites (Amazon, Ciao), and finally citation networks (Cora). The results indicate significant improvement in prediction accuracy over state of the art methods, and demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed approach for addressing a variety of different learning problems commonly occurring with multi-modal social data.

Shifting Behaviour of Users: Towards Understanding the Fundamental Law of Social Networks (Yayati Gupta - 7 November, 2015)
The introduction of a new SNS with a better set of features can lead to the demise of an existing SNS, as observed in the transition from Orkut to Facebook

Estimating network degree distributions under sampling: An inverse problem, with applications to monitoring social media networks (Yaonan Zhang - 28 May, 2015)
In addition, we demonstrate the ability of our method to accurately reconstruct the degree distributions of various sub-communities within online social networks corresponding to Friendster, Orkut and LiveJournal

Social Resilience in Online Communities: The Autopsy of Friendster (David Garcia - 25 February, 2013)
We empirically analyze five online communities: Friendster, Livejournal, Facebook, Orkut, Myspace, to identify causes for the decline of social networks

Towards Unbiased BFS Sampling (Maciej Kurant - 22 February, 2011)
Even though RG(pk) does not capture many graph properties common in real-life graphs (such as assortativity), our RG(pk)-based correction technique performs well on a broad range of Internet topologies and on two large BFS samples of Facebook and Orkut networks

Approaches for user profile Investigation in Orkut Social Network (Rajni Ranjan Singh - 5 December, 2009)
Social networks such as Orkut, Bebo, MySpace, Flickr, Facebook, Friendster and LinkedIn, have attracted millions of internet user who are involved in bogging, participatory book reviewing, personal networking and photo sharing. Information posted on sites such as Orkut and Facebook has been used by police, probation, and university officials to prosecute users of said sites

Leveraging Social-Network Infrastructure to Improve Peer-to-Peer Overlay Performance: Results from Orkut (Zahid Anwar - 28 September, 2005)
We build our overlay on top of the topology of a popular real-world social network namely Orkut. We show Orkuts suitability for our purposes by evaluating the clustering behavior of its graph structure and the socializing pattern of its members.
