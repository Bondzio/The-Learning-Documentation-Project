Year two instrument status of the SPT-3G cosmic microwave background receiver (A. N. Bender - 31 August, 2018)
The SPT began observing in January 2017 with a new receiver (SPT-3G) containing $\sim$16,000 polarization-sensitive transition-edge sensor bolometers. In late 2017 the implementations of all three of these technologies were modified to optimize total performance

Characterization and performance of the second-year SPT-3G focal plane (D. Dutcher - 31 August, 2018)
The third-generation instrument for the 10-meter South Pole Telescope, SPT-3G, was first installed in January 2017. The SPT-3G focal plane consists of ten detector modules, each with an array of 269 trichroic, polarization-sensitive pixels on a six-inch silicon wafer. Within each pixel is a broadband, dual-polarization sinuous antenna; the signal from each orthogonal linear polarization is divided into three frequency bands centered at 95, 150, and 220 GHz by in-line lumped element filters and transmitted via superconducting microstrip to Ti/Au transition-edge sensor (TES) bolometers. Here we discuss the TES superconducting transition temperature and normal resistance, detector saturation power, bandpasses, optical efficiency, and full array yield for the 2018 focal plane.

Output and $k_{Q_{clin},Q_{msr}}^{f_{clin},f_{msr}}$ correction factors measured and calculated in very small circular fields for microDiamond and EFD-3G detectors (Eyad Alhakeem - 31 May, 2018)
The purpose of this work was to obtain output correction factors for microDiamond and EFD-3G detectors in very small (less than 5 mm) circular fields. The measured OFs agreed within 2.4% for fields $\geqslant$10mm. For the cones of 1.27, 2.46, and 3.77mm maximum differences were 17.9, 1.8 and 9.0%, respectively. MC calculated output factors in water agreed with those obtained using EBT3 film within 2.2% for all fields. MicroDiamond detector correction factors calculated for the 1.27, 2.46 and 3.77mm fields were 1.974, 1.139 and 0.982 with detector in parallel orientation, and these factors were 1.150, 0.925 and 0.914 in perpendicular orientation.

Searching for Primordial Magnetic Fields with CMB B-modes (Levon Pogosian - 10 May, 2018)
As we demonstrate, the upcoming experiments, such as SPT-3G and the Simons Observatory, will be sensitive to fields of $\sim 0.5$ nG strength thanks to the mode-coupling signature induced by Faraday rotation. A future Stage IV ground based experiment or a Space Probe will be capable of probing fields below $0.1$ nG, and would detect a scale-invariant PMF of $0.2$ nG strength without de-lensing or subtracting the galactic rotation measure.

Localization accuracy of compact binary coalescences detected by the third-generation gravitational-wave detectors and implication for cosmology (Wen Zhao - 10 March, 2018)
We in particular examine the effect of the Earth's rotation, as GW signals from BNS and low mass NSBH systems could be hours long for 3G detectors. The medium angular resolution for one ET-D detector is around 150 deg$^2$ for BNSs at a redshift of $z=0.1$. The medium angular resolution for a network of two CE detectors in the US and Europe respectively is around 20 deg$^2$ at $z=0.2$ for the simulated BNS and NSBH samples. We find that in general, if 10 BNSs or NSBHs at $z=0.1$ with known redshifts are detected, $H_0$ can be measured with an accuracy of $0.9\%$. If 1000 face-on BNSs at $z<2$ are detected with known redshifts, we are able to achieve $Îq_0=0.002$, or $Îw_0=0.03$ and $Îw_a=0.2$ for dark energy.(Abridged version).

The Impact of Feedback During Massive Star Formation by Core Accretion (Kei E. I. Tanaka - 6 December, 2016)

On the formation of shock for quasilinear wave equations by pulse with weak intensity (Shuang Miao - 13 October, 2016)
In this paper we continue to study the shock formation for the $3$-dimensional quasilinear wave equation \begin{align}\label{main eq} -(1+3G"(0)(\partial_{t}Ï)^{2})\partial^{2}_{t}Ï+ÎÏ=0,\tag{\textbf{$\star$}} \end{align} with $G"(0)$ being a non-zero constant. Compared to our previous work [18], here we pose data on the hypersurface $\{(t,x)|t=-r_{0}\}$ instead of $\{(t,x)|t=-2\}$, with $r_{0}$ being arbitrarily large. We prove an a priori energy estimate independent of $r_{0}$. Therefore a complete description of the solution behavior as $r_{0}\rightarrow\infty$ is obtained. A main new feature in the proof is that all estimates in the present paper do \emph{not} depend on the parameter $r_{0}$, which requires different methods to obtain energy estimates. As a byproduct, we prove the existence of semi-global-in-time solutions which lead to shock formation by showing that the limits of the initial energies exist as $r_{0}\rightarrow\infty$. The proof combines the ideas in [5] where the the formation of shocks for 3-dimensional relativistic compressible Euler equations with small initial data is established, and the short pulse method introduced in [6] and generalized in [15], where the formation of black holes in general relativity is proved.

Rank two vector bundles on polarised Halphen surfaces and the Gauss-Wahl map for du Val curves (Enrico Arbarello - 29 September, 2016)
A genus-g du Val curve is a degree-3g plane curve having 8 points of multiplicity g, one point of multiplicity g-1, and no other singularity. We prove that the corank of the Gauss-Wahl map of a general du Val curve of odd genus (>11) is equal to one. This, together with the results of [1], shows that the characterisation of Brill-Noether-Petri curves with non-surjective Gauss-Wahl map as hyperplane sections of K3 surfaces and limits thereof, obtained in [3], is optimal.

We suppose that there is a Green function $G>0$ for $X$, a metric $Ï$ on $X$ and a decreasing function $g\colon[0,\infty)\to (0,\infty]$ having the doubling property and a mild upper decay near $0$ such that $G\approx g\circÏ$ (which is equivalent to a $3G$-inequality).

Impact of video quality and wireless network interface on power consumption of mobile devices (Norbert Zsak - 1 August, 2014)
We have found that the additional power consumption is up to 38% higher when a movie is played over a WiFi network instead from internal memory and 64% higher in case of a mobile network (3G). We have also discovered that a higher movie quality not only affects the power consumption of the CPU but also the power consumption of the WiFi unit by up to 58% and up to 72% respectively on mobile networks.

Global smooth solutions of 3-D quasilinear wave equations with small initial data (Ding Bingbing - 28 July, 2014)
In this paper, we are concerned with the 3-D quasilinear wave equation $ \ds\sum_{i,j=0}^3g^{ij}(u, \p u)\p_{ij}^2u$ $=0$ with $(u(0,x), \p_tu(0,x))=(\ve u_0(x), \ve u_1(x))$, where $x_0=t$, $x=(x_1, x_2, x_3)$, $\p=(\p_0, \p_1, ..., \p_3)$, $u_0(x), u_1(x)\in C_0^\infty(\Bbb R^3)$, $\ve>0$ is small enough, and $g^{ij}(u, \p u)=g^{ji}(u, \p u)$ are smooth in their arguments. When $\ds\sum_{i,j,k=0}^3e^{ij}_kÃ¸_kÃ¸_iÃ¸_j\not\equiv 0$ for $Ã¸_0=-1$ and $Ã¸=(Ã¸_1, Ã¸_2, Ã¸_3)\in\Bbb S^2$, the authors in [7-8] have shown the blowup of the smooth solution $u$ in finite time as long as $(u_0(x), u_1(x))\not\equiv 0$. In the present paper, when $\ds\sum_{i,j,k=0}^3e^{ij}_kÃ¸_kÃ¸_iÃ¸_j\equiv 0$, we will prove the global existence of the smooth solution $u$

Parallel Interleaver Design for a High Throughput HSPA+/LTE Multi-Standard Turbo Decoder (Guohui Wang - 26 March, 2014)
In this paper, we propose a flexible and efficient VLSI architecture to solve the memory conflict problem for highly parallel turbo decoders targeting multi-standard 3G/4G wireless communication systems. The implemented turbo decoder consists of 16 Radix-4 MAP decoder cores, and the chip core area is 2.43 mm^2. When clocked at 600 MHz, this turbo decoder can achieve a maximum decoding throughput of 826 Mbps in the HSPA+ mode and 1.67 Gbps in the LTE/LTE-Advanced mode, exceeding the peak data rate requirements for both standards.

Assessing the Potential of Ride-Sharing Using Mobile and Social Data (Blerim Cici - 20 March, 2014)
This paper assesses the potential of ride-sharing for reducing traffic in a city, based on mobility data extracted from 3G Call Description Records (CDRs, for the cities of Barcelona and Madrid) and from Online Social Networks (Twitter, collected for the cities of New York and Los Angeles). For example, our study shows that traffic in the city of Madrid can be reduced by 59% if users are willing to share a ride with people who live and work within 1 km; if they can only accept a pick-up and drop-off delay up to 10 minutes, this potential benefit drops to 24%; if drivers also pick up passengers along the way, this number increases to 53%. If users are willing to ride only with people they know ("friends" in the CDR and OSN data sets), the potential of ride-sharing becomes negligible; if they are willing to ride with friends of friends, the potential reduction is up to 31%.

Higgs Properties in the Fourth Generation MSSM: Boosted Signals Over the 3G Plan (R. C. Cotta - 6 May, 2011)
In most of the 3GMSSM parameter space, the lighter CP-even $h$ is $\sim 115-125$ GeV and mostly Standard Model-like while $H,A,H^\pm$ are all relatively heavy. In contrast to this, in the 4GMSSM, heavy fourth generation fermion loops drive the masses of $h,H,H^\pm$ to large values while the CP-odd boson, $A$, can remain relatively light and $\tan Î²$ is restricted to the range $1/2 \lsim \tan Î²\lsim 2$ due to perturbativity requirements on Yukawa couplings. We find that while $gg \to A$ may lead to a potential signal in the $Ï^+Ï^-$ channel at the LHC, $A$ may first be observed in the $Î³Î³$ channel due to a highly loop-enhanced cross section that can be more than an order of magnitude greater than that of a SM Higgs for $A$ masses of $\sim 115-120$ and $\tanÎ²<1$

Linear chord diagrams on two intervals (JÃ¸rgen E. Andersen - 28 October, 2010)
We prove here the surprising fact that ${\bf C}^{[2]}_g(z)=z^{2g+1} R_g^{[2]}(z)/(1-4z)^{3g+2} $ is a rational function, for $g\geq 0$, where the polynomial $R^{[2]}_g(z)$ with degree at most $g$ has integer coefficients and satisfies $R_g^{[2]}({1\over 4})\neq 0$. Earlier work had already determined that the analogous generating function ${\bf C}_g(z)=z^{2g}R_g(z)/(1-4z)^{3g-{1\over 2}}$ for chords attached to a single interval is algebraic, for $g\geq 1$, where the polynomial $R_g(z)$ with degree at most $g-1$ has integer coefficients and satisfies $R_g(1/4)\neq 0$ in analogy to the generating function ${\bf C}_0(z)$ for the Catalan numbers. The new results here on ${\bf C}_g^{[2]}(z)$ rely on this earlier work, and indeed, we find that $R_g^{[2]}(z)=R_{g+1}(z) -z\sum_{g_1=1}^g R_{g_1}(z) R_{g+1-g_1}(z)$, for $g\geq 1$.
