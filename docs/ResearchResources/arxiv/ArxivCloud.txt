DYVERSE: DYnamic VERtical Scaling in Multi-tenant Edge Environments (Nan Wang - 19 September, 2018)
An online-game and a face detection workload in a Cloud-Edge test-bed are used to validate the research. The merits of DYVERSE is that there is only a sub-second overhead per Edge server when 32 Edge servers are deployed on a single Edge node. When compared to executing applications on the Edge servers without dynamic vertical scaling, static priorities and dynamic priorities reduce SLO violation rates of requests by up to 4% and 12% for the online game, respectively, and in both cases 6% for the face detection workload

Faster Data-access in Large-scale Systems: Network-scale Latency Analysis under General Service-time Distributions (Avishek Ghosh - 6 July, 2018)
We analyze the mean latency of such a split-and-replicate cloud storage system under general sub-exponential service time. We present a novel scheduling scheme that utilizes the load-balancing policy of the \textit{power of $d$ $(\geq 2)$} choices. We argue that under high redundancy (integer redundancy factor strictly greater than or equal to 2) regime, the mean latency of a coded system is upper bounded by that of a split-and-replicate system (with same replication factor) and the gap between these two is small. We observe that the coded system outperforms the unsplit-replication system by at least $20\%$. Furthermore, we consider the mean latency for an erasure coded system with low redundancy (fractional redundancy factor between 1 and 2), a scenario which is more pragmatic, given the storage constraints (\cite{rashmi_thesis})

In this paper, the resulting problem is studied from an information-theoretic viewpoint by making the following practically relevant assumptions: 1) the ENs have multiple antennas; 2) only uncoded fractional caching is allowed; 3) the fronthaul links are used to send fractions of contents; and 4) the ENs are constrained to use one-shot linear precoding on the wireless channel. The characterization is exact for a subset of system parameters, and is generally optimal within a multiplicative factor of 3/2 for the serial case and of 2 for the pipelined case

Private Function Retrieval (Mahtab Mirmohseni - 15 November, 2017)
The widespread use of cloud computing services raises the question of how one can delegate the processing tasks to the untrusted distributed parties without breeching the privacy of its data and algorithms. We first show that for the PFR problem with $K$ messages, $N=2$ servers and a linear function with binary coefficients the capacity is $C=\frac{1}{2}\Big(1-\frac{1}{2^K}\Big)^{-1}$. Then, we extend the proposed achievable scheme to the case of arbitrary number of servers and coefficients in the field $GF(q)$ with arbitrary $q$ and obtain $R=\Big(1-\frac{1}{N}\Big)\Big(1+\frac{\frac{1}{N-1}}{(\frac{q^K-1}{q-1})^{N-1}}\Big)$.

Remote sensing of forests using discrete return airborne LiDAR (Hamid Hamraz - 17 July, 2017)

Stratifying the canopy improved the detection rate of understory trees to 68% at the cost of increasing their over-segmentations to 16%. Lastly, using the distributed approach, we segmented about two million trees in the 7,440-ha forest in 2.5 hours using 192 processors, which is 167 times faster than using a single processor
