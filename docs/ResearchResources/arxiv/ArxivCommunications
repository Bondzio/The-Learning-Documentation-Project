Distributed Nonlinear Control Design using Separable Control Contraction Metrics (Humberto Stein Shiromoto - 10 October, 2018)
It is shown that the technique of control contraction metrics (CCMs) can be extended to this problem by utilizing separable metric structures, resulting in controllers that only depend on information from local sensors and communications from immediate neighbours. The results are illustrated on a problem of vehicle platooning with heterogeneous vehicles, and a network of nonlinear dynamic systems with over 1000 states that is not feedback linearizable and has an uncontrollable linearization

The Influence of Canyon Shadowing on Device-to-Device Connectivity in Urban Scenario (Quentin Le Gall - 8 October, 2018)
In this work, we use percolation theory to study the feasibility of large-scale connectivity of relay-augmented device-to-device (D2D) networks in an urban scenario, featuring a haphazard system of streets and canyon shadowing allowing only for line-of-sight (LOS) communications in a limited finite range. Through simulations, we estimated this threshold to 71.3%. Moreover, if the mean street length is not larger than some threshold (predicted to 74.3% of the communication range; which might be the case in a typical urban scenario) then any (whatever small) density of users can be compensated by equipping more crossroads with relays

Propagation Measurement System and Approach at 140 GHz-Moving to 6G and Above 100 GHz (Yunchou Xing - 22 August, 2018)
With the relatively recent realization that millimeter wave frequencies are viable for mobile communications, extensive measurements and research have been conducted on frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz, and several global wireless standard bodies have proposed channel models for frequencies below 100 GHz. Presently, little is known about the radio channel above 100 GHz where there are much wider unused bandwidth slots available. This paper summarizes wireless communication research and activities above 100 GHz, overviews the results of previously published propagation measurements at D-band (110-170 GHz), provides the design of a 140 GHz wideband channel sounder system, and proposes indoor wideband propagation measurements and penetration measurements for common materials at 140 GHz which were not previously investigated.

Analytical Models of the Performance of C-V2X Mode 4 Vehicular Communications (Manuel Gonzalez-Martin - 17 July, 2018)
The C-V2X or LTE-V standard has been designed to support V2X (Vehicle to Everything) communications. The standard is an evolution of LTE, and it has been published by the 3GPP in Release 14. This new standard introduces the C-V2X or LTE-V Mode 4 that is specifically designed for V2V communications. In Mode 4, vehicles autonomously select and manage their radio resources without any cellular infrastructure support. Mode 4 is highly relevant since V2V safety applications cannot depend on the availability of infrastructure-based cellular coverage. This paper presents a set of novel analytical models of the communication performance of C-V2X or LTE-V Mode 4. In particular, the paper presents analytical models for the average PDR (Packet Delivery Ratio) as a function of the distance between transmitter and receiver, and for the four different types of transmission errors that can be encountered in C-V2X or LTE-V Mode 4. To this aim, this study compares the results obtained with the analytical models to those obtained with a C-V2X or LTE-V Mode 4 simulator implemented by the authors over the Veins simulation platform. To the authors' knowledge, the models presented in this paper are the first to analytically model the communication performance of C-V2X or LTE-V Mode 4.

This letter presents, for the first time, evaluations of the spectral efficiency of such schemes based on measured cellular demand distributions. In particular, we use a database with more than 100 million requests (689,461 for cellular users) from the BBC iPlayer, a popular video streaming service in the U.K., to evaluate the throughput-outage tradeoff of a random caching D2D based scheme, and find that also for this realistic case, order-of-magnitude improvements can be achieved. The gains depend on the size of the local cache in the devices; e.g., with a cache size of 32 GB, a throughput increase of two orders of magnitude at an outage probability between 0.01 and 0.1 can be obtained.

We analyze the effect of the Mode 4 resource pool configuration and some of the key SPS parameters on the scheduling performance and find that the resource reservation interval significantly influences packet data rate performance, whereas resource reselection probability has little effect in dense vehicular highway scenarios

Resource Allocation and HARQ Optimization for URLLC Traffic in 5G Wireless Networks (Arjun Anand - 10 May, 2018)
5G wireless networks are expected to support Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) traffic which requires very low packet delays ( < 1 msec.) and extremely high reliability ($\sim$99.999\%). Using a queuing network based model for the wireless system we characterize the effect of various design choices on the maximum URLLC load it can support, including: 1) system parameters such as the bandwidth, link SINR , and QoS requirements; 2) resource allocation schemes in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) based systems; and 3) Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) schemes. Key contributions of this paper which are of practical interest are: 1) study of how the the minimum required system bandwidth to support a given URLLC load scales with associated QoS constraints; 2) characterization of optimal OFDMA resource allocation schemes which maximize the admissible URLLC load; and 3) optimization of a repetition code based HARQ scheme which approximates Chase HARQ combining.

Understanding UAV Cellular Communications: From Existing Networks to Massive MIMO (Giovanni Geraci - 20 April, 2018)
Special emphasis is placed on the downlink command and control (C&C) channel to aerial users, whose reliability is deemed of paramount technological importance for the commercial success of UAV cellular communications. Through a realistic side-by-side comparison of two network deployments -- a present-day cellular infrastructure versus a next-generation massive MIMO system -- a plurality of key facts are cast light upon, with the three main ones summarized as follows: (i) UAV cell selection is essentially driven by the secondary lobes of a base station's radiation pattern, causing UAVs to associate to far-flung cells; (ii) over a 10 MHz bandwidth, and for UAV heights of up to 300 m, massive MIMO networks can support 100 kbps C&C channels in 74% of the cases when the uplink pilots for channel estimation are reused among base station sites, and in 96% of the cases without pilot reuse across the network; (iii) supporting UAV C&C channels can considerably affect the performance of ground users on account of severe pilot contamination, unless suitable power control policies are in place.

The Capacity of Anonymous Communications (Hua Sun - 4 April, 2018)
The capacity of anonymous communications is the maximum number of bits of desired information that can be anonymously communicated per bit of total communication. For this anonymous communication problem over a parallel channel with K transmitters and 1 receiver, we show that the capacity is 1/K, i.e., to communicate 1 bit anonymously, each transmitter must send a 1 bit signal. Further, it is required that each transmitter has at least 1 bit correlated randomness (that is independent of the messages) per message bit and the size of correlated randomness at all K transmitters is at least K-1 bits per message bit.

In particular, given $L$ channels, order $K\log K \left(1+\frac{1}{L}\log N\right)$ samples per channel, selected randomly from $N$ equispaced samples, suffice to guarantee with high probability exact estimation of $K$ normalized frequencies that are mutually separated by at least $\frac{4}{N}$

Adaptive Coding and Modulation for Large-Scale Antenna Array Based Aeronautical Communications in the Presence of Co-channel Interference (Jiankang Zhang - 25 November, 2017)
In order to meet the demands of `Internet above the clouds', we propose a multiple-antenna aided adaptive coding and modulation (ACM) for aeronautical communications. For the specific example of 32 transmit antennas and 4 receive antennas communicating at a 5 GHz carrier frequency and using 6 MHz bandwidth, which are reused by multiple other pairs of communicating aircraft, the proposed distance-based ACM is capable of providing as high as 65.928 Mbps data rate when the communication distance is less than 25\,km.

For Markovian protocols, we first show that a rate of $\frac{2}{3}(1-h(\varepsilon))$ can be trivially achieved. Specifically, we show that this scheme outperforms the trivial one for any $\varepsilon<0.044$, and achieves a rate higher than $\frac{1-h(\varepsilon)}{1+h(\varepsilon)+h\left(<\varepsilon(2-\varepsilon)>\right)}=1-Î(h(\varepsilon))$ as $\varepsilon\to 0$, which is order-wise the best possible

Rapid Fading Due to Human Blockage in Pedestrian Crowds at 5G Millimeter-Wave Frequencies (George R. MacCartney Jr. - 7 November, 2017)
Rapidly fading channels caused by pedestrians in dense urban environments will have a significant impact on millimeter-wave (mmWave) communications systems that employ electrically-steerable and narrow beamwidth antenna arrays. A peer-to-peer (P2P) measurement campaign was conducted with 7-degree, 15-degree, and 60-degree half-power beamwidth (HPBW) antenna pairs at 73.5 GHz and with 1 GHz of RF null-to-null bandwidth in a heavily populated open square scenario in Brooklyn, New York, to study blockage events caused by typical pedestrian traffic. Transition probability rates are determined from the measurements and it is shown that average fade durations with a -5 dB threshold are 299.0 ms for 7-degree HPBW antennas and 260.2 ms for 60-degree HPBW antennas. The four-state piecewise linear modeling approach shows that signal strength decay and rise times are asymmetric for blockage events and that mean signal attenuations (average fade depths) are inversely proportional to antenna HPBW, where 7-degree and 60-degree HPBW antennas resulted in mean signal fades of 15.8 dB and 11.5 dB, respectively

Performance Analysis of Integrated Sub-6 GHz-Millimeter Wave Wireless Local Area Networks (Omid Semiari - 4 September, 2017)
Millimeter wave (mmW) communications at the 60 GHz unlicensed band is seen as a promising approach for boosting the capacity of wireless local area networks (WLANs). If properly integrated into legacy IEEE 802.11 standards, mmW communications can offer substantial gains by offloading traffic from congested sub-6 GHz unlicensed bands to the 60 GHz mmW frequency band. The proposed protocol leverages the capability of advanced multi-band wireless stations (STAs) to perform fast session transfers (FST) to the mmW band, while considering the intermittent channel at the 60 GHz band and the level of congestion observed over the sub-6 GHz bands. Simulation results show that the proposed integrated mmW-sub 6 GHz MAC protocol yields significant performance gains, in terms of maximizing the saturation throughput and minimizing the delay experienced by the STAs

Coverage and Rate Analysis of Super Wi-Fi Networks Using Stochastic Geometry (Neelakantan Nurani Krishnan - 26 April, 2017)
Recent regulatory changes proposed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) permitting unlicensed use of television white space (TVWS) channels present new opportunities for designing wireless networks that make efficient use of this spectrum. Since regulations governing unlicensed use of these channels allow (a) mounting fixed devices up to a height of 30 m and operation at transmit powers of up to 4 W EIRP, and (b) operation at transmit powers of up to 100 mW EIRP for portable devices, such networks can provide extended coverage and higher rates than traditional Wi-Fi networks. Such an analysis reveals that (a) maximum coverage of no more than 700 m is obtained even when APs are deployed at 30 m height, and (b) operating APs at transmit power of more than 1 W is beneficial only at sparse deployment densities when rate is prioritized over coverage.

Study on 3GPP Rural Macrocell Path Loss Models for Millimeter Wave Wireless Communications (George R. MacCartney Jr. - 29 March, 2017)
This paper studies past rural macrocell (RMa) path loss models and exposes concerns with the current 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) TR 38.900 (Release 14) RMa path loss models adopted from the International Telecommunications Union - Radiocommunications (ITU-R) Sector. This paper shows how the 3GPP RMa large-scale path loss models were derived for frequencies below 6 GHz, yet they are being asserted for use up to 30 GHz, even though there has not been sufficient work or published data to support their validity at frequencies above 6 GHz or in the mmWave bands. This work shows the CI and CIH models can be used from 500 MHz to 100 GHz for rural mmWave coverage and interference analysis, without any discontinuity at 6 GHz as exists in today's 3GPP and ITU-R RMa models.

On the Deployment of Distributed Antennas for Wireless Power Transfer with Safety Electromagnetic Radiation Level Requirement (Chao Zhang - 7 March, 2017)

First, the minimum antenna height of DA-PB is derived to make the radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation power density at any location of the charging cell lower than the SERL published by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Second, the closed-form expressions of average harvested Direct Current (DC) power per user in the charging cell for pass-loss exponent 2 and 4 are also provided. In order to maximize the average efficiency of WPT, the optimal radii for distributed antennas elements (DAEs) are derived when the pass-loss exponent takes the typical value $2$ and $4$

How CSMA/CA With Deferral Affects Performance and Dynamics in Power-Line Communications (Christina Vlachou - 31 October, 2016)
Power-line communications (PLC) are becoming a key component in home networking, because they provide easy and high-throughput connectivity. The dominant MAC protocol for high data-rate PLC, the IEEE 1901, employs a CSMA/CA mechanism similar to the backoff process of 802.11. However, in contrast to 802.11, 1901 stations can change their state after sensing the medium busy, which is regulated by the so-called deferral counter. In this paper, we propose a performance model for 1901, which does not rely on the decoupling assumption. In addition to evaluating the performance in steady state, we further study the transient dynamics of 1901, which is also affected by the deferral counter.

Secure Communication in Uplink Transmissions: User Selection and Multiuser Secrecy Gain (Hao Deng - 18 August, 2016)
In this paper, we investigate secure communications in uplink transmissions, where there are a base station (BS) with M receive antennas, K mobile users each with a single antenna, and an eavesdropper with N receive antennas. Therefore, when N is much larger than M, serving one user with the strongest channel (TDMA-like) is a favourable secrecy scheme, where the ESSR scales with root square of 2 log K.

Delay and Backlog Analysis for 60 GHz Wireless Networks (Guang Yang - 8 August, 2016)
To meet the ever-increasing demands on higher throughput and better network delay performance, 60 GHZ networking is proposed as a promising solution for the next generation of wireless communications. However, due to the unique fading characteristic of the 60 GHz channel, the characterization of the corresponding service process, offered by the channel, using the conventional methodologies may not be tractable. In this work, we provide an alternative approach to derive a closed-form expression that characterizes the cumulative service process of the 60 GHz channel in terms of the moment generating function (MGF) of its instantaneous channel capacity. We provide numerical results for different networking scenarios and for different traffic and channel parameters and we show that the 60 GHz wireless network is capable of satisfying stringent quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements, in terms of network delay and reliability. With this analysis approach at hand, a larger scale 60 GHz network design and optimization is possible.

Performance Comparison of Dual Connectivity and Hard Handover for LTE-5G Tight Integration (Michele Polese - 19 July, 2016)
Communications at frequencies above 10 GHz (the mmWave band) are expected to play a major role for the next generation of cellular networks (5G), because of the potential multi-gigabit, ultra-low latency performance of this technology. However, when propagation conditions are hard and it is difficult to provide high quality coverage with mmWave BS, it is necessary to rely on previous generation LTE base stations, which make use of lower frequencies (900 MHz - 3.5 GHz), which are less sensitive to blockage and experience lower pathloss

Numerical results show that VBS pools can achieve more than 75% of the maximum pooling gain with 50 VBSs, but further convergence to the upper bound (large-pool limit) is slow because of the quickly diminishing marginal pooling gain, which is inversely proportional to a factor between the one-half and three-fourth power of the pool size

Community structure is essential for social communications, where individuals belonging to the same community are much more actively interacting and communicating with each other than those in different communities within the human society. Simulations show that 1) the convergence process to global consensus is getting slower as the community structure becomes more prominent, and eventually might fail; 2) if the inter-community connections are sufficiently dense, neither the number nor the size of the communities affects the convergence process; and 3) for different topologies with the same average node-degree, local clustering of individuals obstruct or prohibit global consensus to take place

Multi-Phase Smart Relaying and Cooperative Jamming in Secure Cognitive Radio Networks (Pin-Hsun Lin - 13 May, 2016)
In this paper we investigate cooperative secure communications in a four-node cognitive radio network where the secondary receiver is treated as a potential eavesdropper with respect to the primary transmission. In addition, we propose a multi-phase transmission scheme to include 1) the phases of the clean relaying with cooperative jamming and 2) the latency to successfully decode the primary message at the secondary transmitter. Numerical results show that: 1) the proposed scheme can outperform the traditional ones by properly selecting the secondary user's parameters of different transmission schemes according to the relative positions of the nodes; 2) the derived capacity upper bound is close to the secondary user's achievable rate within 0.3 bits/channel use, especially when the secondary transmitter/receiver is far/close enough to the primary receiver/transmitter, respectively

Our scheme has the  following important advantages: 1) The proposed online jammers placement and interfering power  allocation to attack eavesdroppers is the first distributed and scalable solutions within any specified geographic region, 2) We model the WEH for jammers as a \emph{JAM-NET lifetime maximization problem}, where online scheduling algorithms with heterogeneous energy demands of each jammer (from energy sources) are designed, 3) Under our model, the problem of placing a minimum number of jammers with distance-based power assignments is NP-hard, and near optimal PTAS approximation algorithms are provided, 4) When durations of the eavesdropping and legitimate communicating are available and the scenario is extended to the multi-channels setting, our results are strengthened to see further improved EE and reduced number of jammers

Indoor 5G 3GPP-like Channel Models for Office and Shopping Mall Environments (Katsuyuki Haneda - 13 March, 2016)
To meet these service demands the telecommunications industry is converging on a common set of 5G requirements which includes network speeds as high as 10 Gbps, cell edge rate greater than 100 Mbps, and latency of less than 1 msec. To reach these 5G requirements the industry is looking at new spectrum bands in the range up to 100 GHz where there is spectrum availability for wide bandwidth channels. For the development of new 5G systems to operate in bands up to 100 GHz there is a need for accurate radio propagation models which are not addressed by existing channel models developed for bands below 6 GHz. This paper presents a preliminary overview of the 5G channel models for bands up to 100 GHz in indoor offices and shopping malls, derived from extensive measurements across a multitude of bands. These studies have found some extensibility of the existing 3GPP models to the higher frequency bands up to 100 GHz
