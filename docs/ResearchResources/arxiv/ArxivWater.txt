The feasibility of automated identification of six algae types using neural networks and fluorescence-based spectral-morphological features (Jason L. Deglint - 2 May, 2018)
More specifically, a custom multi-band fluorescence imaging microscope is used to capture fluorescence imaging data of a water sample at six different excitation wavelengths ranging from 405 nm - 530 nm. Experimental results using three different neural network classification models showed that the use of either fluorescence-based spectral features or fluorescence-based spectral-morphological features to train neural network classification models led to statistically significant improvements in identification accuracy when compared to the use of morphological features (with average identification accuracies of 95.7%+/-3.5% and 96.1%+/-1.5%, respectively). These preliminary results are quite promising, given that the identification accuracy of human taxonomists are typically between the range of 67% and 83%, and thus illustrates the feasibility of leveraging machine learning and fluorescence-based spectral-morphological features as a viable method for automated identification of different algae types.

Simple, Flexible, and Interoperable SCADA System Based on Agent Technology (Hosny A. Abbas - 15 August, 2015)
SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) is concerned with gathering process information from industrial control processes found in utilities such as power grids, water networks, transportation, manufacturing, etc., to provide the human operators with the required real-time access to industrial processes to be monitored and controlled either locally (on-site)or remotely (i.e., through Internet). The proposed SCADA system has the following advantages: 1) simple (easier to be implemented); 2) flexible (able to adapt to its environment dynamic changes); and 3) interoperable (relative to the underlying control systems, which belongs to diverse of vendors)

An Optimal Framework for Residential Load Aggregator (Qinran Hu - 14 June, 2015)
Due to the development of intelligent demand-side management with automatic control, distributed populations of large residential loads, such as air conditioners (ACs) and electrical water heaters (EWHs), have the opportunities to provide effective demand-side ancillary services for load serving entities (LSEs) to reduce the emissions and network operating costs. Most present approaches are restricted to 1) the scenarios involving with efficiently scheduling the large number of appliances in real time, 2) the issues about evaluating the contributions of individual residents towards participating demand response (DR) program, and fairly distributing the rewards, and 3) the concerns on performing cost-effective demand reduction request (DRR) for LSEs with minimal rewards costs while not affecting their living comfortableness

Power Control and Multiuser Diversity for the Distributed Cognitive Uplink (Ehsan Nekouei - 6 April, 2013)
It is first shown that the optimum distributed power control policy is in the form of a threshold based water-filling power control. When transmissions of secondary users are limited by both transmission and interference power constraints, it is shown that the secondary network sum-rate scales according to $\frac{1}{\e{}n_h}\log\logp{N}$, where $n_h$ is a parameter obtained from the distribution of direct channel power gains. For the case of transmissions limited only by interference constraints, on the other hand, the secondary network sum-rate scales according to $\frac{1}{\e{}Î³_g}\logp{N}$, where $Î³_g$ is a parameter obtained from the distribution of interference channel power gains. These results indicate that the distributed cognitive uplink is able to achieve throughput scaling behavior similar to that of the centralized cognitive uplink up to a pre-log multiplier $\frac{1}{\e{}}$, whilst primary's quality-of-service requirements are met. The factor $\frac{1}{\e{}}$ can be interpreted as the cost of distributed implementation of the cognitive uplink.

To run a finite element simulation on a water-tight CSG model, two alternatives are possible: (i) it can either be converted to a B-Rep-model to obtain a finite element mesh or (ii) its implicit description can be used directly by applying an embedded domain approach, like the Finite Cell Method (FCM)

Convolutional Neural Networks for Passive Monitoring of a Shallow Water Environment using a Single Sensor (Eric L. Ferguson - 11 December, 2016)
A cost effective approach to remote monitoring of protected areas such as marine reserves and restricted naval waters is to use passive sonar to detect, classify, localize, and track marine vessel activity (including small boats and autonomous underwater vehicles). Cepstral analysis of underwater acoustic data enables the time delay between the direct path arrival and the first multipath arrival to be measured, which in turn enables estimation of the instantaneous range of the source (a small boat)

Queuing models for abstracting interactions in Bacterial communities (NicolÃ² Michelusi - 10 January, 2016)
Microbial communities play a significant role in bioremediation,plant growth,human and animal digestion,global elemental cycles including the carbon-cycle,and water treatment.They are also posed to be the engines of renewable energy via microbial fuel cells which can reverse the process of electrosynthesis.Microbial communication regulates many virulence mechanisms used by bacteria.Thus,it is of fundamental importance to understand interactions in microbial communities and to develop predictive tools that help control them,in order to aid the design of systems exploiting bacterial capabilities.This position paper explores how abstractions from communications,networking and information theory can play a role in understanding and modeling bacterial interactions.In particular,two forms of interactions in bacterial systems will be examined:electron transfer and quorum sensing.While the diffusion of chemical signals has been heavily studied,electron transfer occurring in living cells and its role in cell-cell interaction is less understood.Recent experimental observations open up new frontiers in the design of microbial systems based on electron transfer,which may coexist with the more well-known interaction strategies based on molecular diffusion.In quorum sensing,the concentration of certain signature chemical compounds emitted by the bacteria is used to estimate the bacterial population size,so as to activate collective behaviors.In this position paper,queuing models for electron transfer are summarized and adapted to provide new models for quorum sensing.These models are stochastic,and thus capture the inherent randomness exhibited by cell colonies in nature.It is shown that queuing models allow the characterization of the state of a single cell as a function of interactions with other cells and the environment,while being amenable to complexity reduction.

In this study, we investigate the appeared complexity of two-phase flow (air/water) in a heterogeneous soil where the supposed porous media is non-deformable media which is under the timedependent gas pressure

From Spectrum Pooling to Space Pooling: Opportunistic Interference Alignment in MIMO Cognitive Networks (S. M. Perlaza - 24 December, 2009)
Assuming perfect channel knowledge at the primary receiver and transmitter, capacity is achieved by transmiting along the spatial directions (SD) associated with the singular values of its channel matrix using a water-filling power allocation (PA) scheme

A Deterministic Equivalent for the Analysis of Correlated MIMO Multiple Access Channels (Romain Couillet - 24 October, 2010)
Specifically, an approximation of all rates achieved within the ergodic rate region is derived and an approximation of the linear precoders that achieve the boundary of the rate region as well as an iterative water-filling algorithm to obtain these precoders are provided

Mathematical Models in Danube Water Quality (Valerian Antohe - 27 May, 2009)
The mathematical shaping in the study of water quality has become a branch of environmental engineering. This paper presents a browsing through some mathematical categories of processing the statistical data, examples and their analysis concerning the degree of water pollution downstream the river Danube.
