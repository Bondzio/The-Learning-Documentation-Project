Using Multi-task and Transfer Learning to Solve Working Memory Tasks (T. S. Jayram - 28 September, 2018)
We propose a new architecture called Memory-Augmented Encoder-Solver (MAES) that enables transfer learning to solve complex working memory tasks adapted from cognitive psychology. We show by extensive experimentation that the trained MAES models achieve task-size generalization, i.e., they are capable of handling sequential inputs 50 times longer than seen during training, with appropriately large memory modules

How to analyze ambivalence when studying technology acceptance: The case of VJ software automation (Anna Spagnolli - 30 July, 2018)
We suggest that adopting a qualitative approach based on discursive psychology would allow researchers to deal comfortably and usefully with ambivalence, turning it into a precious source of information when trying to fathom technology acceptance. In a preliminary phase of the study seven stakeholders (VJs, DJs, promoters and venue owners) were interviewed face-to-face, and 102 more via an online survey, about their view of the live music performance sector and of the software they use. The ambivalent points surfaced during this phase were further unpacked in a subsequent, more focused set of interviews with 25 DJs and VJs

Paired Comparison Sentiment Scores (Christoph Dalitz - 10 July, 2018)
The method of paired comparisons is an established method in psychology. A cross-validation experiment suggests that only about 18 two-fold comparisons are necessary to estimate the score of a new, yet unknown word, provided these words are selected by a modification of a method by Silverstein & Farrell. By such an evaluation, we compared the corpus-based lexica SentiWS, SenticNet, and SentiWordNet, of which SenticNet 4 performed best. This technical report is a corrected and extended version of a presentation made at the ICDM Sentire workshop in 2016.

Depression Severity Estimation from Multiple Modalities (Evgeny Stepanov - 10 November, 2017)
In psychology literature, the PHQ-8 questionnaire is well established as a tool for measuring the severity of depression. We show that visual features extracted from facial landmarks obtain the best performance in terms of estimating the PHQ-8 results with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.66 on the development set. Behavioral characteristics from speech provide an MAE of 4.73. Language features yield a slightly higher MAE of 5.17. When switching to the test set, our Turn Features derived from audio transcriptions achieve the best performance, scoring an MAE of 4.11 (corresponding to an RMSE of 4.94), which makes our system the winner of the AVEC 2017 depression sub-challenge.

NPCs Vote! Changing Voter Reactions Over Time Using the Extreme AI Personality Engine (Jeffrey Georgeson - 17 September, 2016)
Can non-player characters have human-realistic personalities, changing over time depending on input from those around them? And can they have different reactions and thoughts about different people? Using Extreme AI, a psychology-based personality engine using the Five Factor model of personality, I answer these questions by creating personalities for 100 voters and allowing them to react to two politicians to see if the NPC voters' choice of candidate develops in a realistic-seeming way, based on initial and changing personality facets and on their differing feelings toward the politicians (in this case, across liking, trusting, and feeling affiliated with the candidates). After 16 test runs, the voters did indeed change their attitudes and feelings toward the candidates in different and yet generally realistic ways, and even changed their attitudes about other issues based on what a candidate extolled.

Chapter 1 discusses the underpinnings of curiosity in human beings, including the major categories of curiosity, curiosity-related emotions and behaviors, and the benefits of curiosity. Chapter 2 reviews the arousal theories of curiosity in psychology and summarizes a general two-step process model for computational curiosity. Base on the perspective of the two-step process model, Chapter 3 reviews and analyzes some of the traditional computational models of curiosity. Chapter 4 introduces a novel generic computational model of curiosity, which is developed based on the arousal theories of curiosity. After the discussion of computational models of curiosity, we outline the important applications where computational curiosity may bring significant impacts in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 discusses the application of the generic computational model of curiosity in a machine learning framework. Chapter 7 discusses the application of the generic computational model of curiosity in a recommender system. In Chapter 8 and Chapter 9, the generic computational model of curiosity is studied in two types of pedagogical agents. In Chapter 8, a curious peer learner is studied.

Lessons from the Failure and Subsequent Success of a Complex Healthcare Sector IT Project (David Greenwood - 14 May, 2010)
We propose a novel method, Stakeholder Impact Analysis, that can be used to identify risks associated with socio-complexity as it is grounded in insights from the social sciences, psychology and management science. This paper demonstrates the effectiveness of Stakeholder Impact Analysis by using the 1992 London Ambulance Service Computer Aided Dispatch project as a case study, and shows that had our method been used to identify the risks and had they been mitigated, it would have reduced the risk of project failure

The Import and Export of Cognitive Science (Rob Goldstone - 18 November, 2009)
In 2005, psychology was a keyword for 51% of submissions, followed distantly by linguistics (17%), artificial intelligence (13%), neuroscience (10%), computer science (9%), and philosophy (8%). By studying the patterns of citations among journals that cite and are cited by Cognitive Science, we can better: 1) appreciate the scholarly ecology surrounding the journal and the journals role within this ecology, 2) establish competitor and alternate journals, and 3) determine the natural clustering of fields related to cognitive science.

Ten-Year Cross-Disciplinary Comparison of the Growth of Open Access and How it Increases Research Citation Impact (C. Hajjem - 15 August, 2006)
We tested 1,307,038 articles published across 12 years (1992-2003) in 10 disciplines (Biology, Psychology, Sociology, Health, Political Science, Economics, Education, Law, Business, Management). A robot trawls the Web for full-texts using reference metadata ISI citation data (signal detectability d'=2.45; bias = 0.52). Percentage OA (relative to total OA + NOA) articles varies from 5%-16% (depending on discipline, year and country) and is slowly climbing annually (correlation r=.76, sample size N=12, probability p < 0.005). Comparing OA and NOA articles in the same journal/year, OA articles have consistently more citations, the advantage varying from 36%-172% by discipline and year. Comparing articles within six citation ranges (0, 1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15, 16+ citations), the annual percentage of OA articles is growing significantly faster than NOA within every citation range (r > .90, N=12, p < .0005) and the effect is greater with the more highly cited articles (r = .98, N=6, p < .005). Causality cannot be determined from these data, but our prior finding of a similar pattern in physics, where percent OA is much higher (and even approaches 100% in some subfields), makes it unlikely that the OA citation advantage is merely or mostly a self-selection bias (for making only one's better articles OA)

Our results indicate that such computational indices may reveal the components and complex dynamics of consumer psychology as a collective socio-economic phenomenon, potentially leading to improved and more refined economic forecasting.

SimLex-999: Evaluating Semantic Models with (Genuine) Similarity Estimation (Felix Hill - 14 August, 2014)
First, in contrast to gold standards such as WordSim-353 and MEN, it explicitly quantifies similarity rather than association or relatedness, so that pairs of entities that are associated but not actually similar [Freud, psychology] have a low rating. Further, unlike existing gold standard evaluations, for which automatic approaches have reached or surpassed the inter-annotator agreement ceiling, state-of-the-art models perform well below this ceiling on SimLex-999

Toward Psycho-robots (Andrei Khrennikov - 13 September, 2007)
We try to perform geometrization of psychology by representing mental states, <<ideas>>, by points of a metric space, <<mental space>>. Since the presence of a huge numbers of psycho-complexes is an essential characteristic of human psychology, it would be interesting to model them in the AI-framework.

Reinforcement Learning: A Survey (L. P. Kaelbling - 30 April, 1996)
The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state
