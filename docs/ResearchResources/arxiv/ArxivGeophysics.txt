Extreme Scale-out SuperMUC Phase 2 - lessons learned (Nicolay Hammer - 6 September, 2016)
The following projects participated in the extreme scale-out workshop: BQCD (Quantum Physics), SeisSol (Geophysics, Seismics), GPI-2/GASPI (Toolkit for HPC), Seven-League Hydro (Astrophysics), ILBDC (Lattice Boltzmann CFD), Iphigenie (Molecular Dynamic), FLASH (Astrophysics), GADGET (Cosmological Dynamics), PSC (Plasma Physics), waLBerla (Lattice Boltzmann CFD), Musubi (Lattice Boltzmann CFD), Vertex3D (Stellar Astrophysics), CIAO (Combustion CFD), and LS1-Mardyn (Material Science). The projects were allowed to use the machine exclusively during the 28 day period, which corresponds to a total of 63.4 million core-hours, of which 43.8 million core-hours were used by the applications, resulting in a utilization of 69%. The top 3 users were using 15.2, 6.4, and 4.7 million core-hours, respectively.

A study of seismology as a dynamic, distributed area of scientific research (Caroline S. Wagner - 7 December, 2009)
The bibliographic analysis, however, does not show that seismology is more internationalised than geophysics: in 2000, seismology had a lower percentage of all articles co-authored on an international basis

SIR-Hawkes: Linking Epidemic Models and Hawkes Processes to Model Diffusions in Finite Populations (Marian-Andrei Rizoiu - 20 February, 2018)
The latter have roots in geophysics and finance, view individual actions as discrete events in continuous time, and modulate the rate of events according to the self-exciting nature of event sequences
