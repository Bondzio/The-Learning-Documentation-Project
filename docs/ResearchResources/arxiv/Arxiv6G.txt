Resonant Beam Communications (Mingliang Xiong - 8 October, 2018)
The sixth generation (6G) mobile communication vision includes the wireless power transfer (WPT) and free-space optical communication (FSO) for the Internet of things (IoT) devices. The results show that signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) >40 dB can be obtained, although there is a trade-off between SNR and receiver's power conversion efficiency

Counting conjugacy classes of fully irreducibles: double exponential growth (Ilya Kapovich - 9 July, 2018)
Let $h=6g-6$. For $L\ge 0$ let $\mathfrak N_r(L)$ denote the number of $Out(F_r)$-conjugacy classes of fully irreducibles $Ï\in Out(F_r)$ with dilatation $Î»(Ï)$ satisfying $\logÎ»(Ï)\le L$.

Theoretical investigation of spectroscopic properties of $W^{25+}$ (A. Alkauskas - 4 December, 2015)
Configuration interaction strength is used to determine the configurations exhibiting the largest influence on the $4f^{3}$, $4d^{9}4f^{4}$, $4f^{2}5s$, $4f^{2}5p$, $4f^{2}5d$, $4f^{2}5f$, $4f^{2}5g$, and $4f^{2}6g$ configuration energies. It is shown that correlation effects are crucial for the $4f^{2}5s \rightarrow 4f^{3}$ transition which in single-configuration approach occurs due to the weak electric octupole transitions. As well, the correlation effects affect the $4f^{2}5d \rightarrow 4f^{3}$ transitions by increasing transition probabilities by an order. Modeling in 10--30 nm wavelength range produces lines which do not form emission bands and can be observed in EBIT plasma.

Low-Threshold and Narrow Linewidth Diffusive Random Lasing in Rhodamine 6G Dye-Doped Polyurethane with Dispersed ZrO$_2$ Nanoparticles (Benjamin R. Anderson - 21 August, 2015)
We report on low-threshold and narrow linewidth intensity feedback random lasing in Rhodamine 6G dye-doped polyurethane with dispersed ZrO$_2$ nanoparticles. Depending on the dye/particle concentration, the lasing threshold is (6.8--15.4) MW/cm$^2$ and the linewidth is (4--6) nm. The lasing threshold as a function of nanoparticle concentration is found to follow a power law with an exponent of $-0.496 \pm 0.010$, which is within uncertainty of Burin et al.'s theoretical prediction [Phys. 87, 215503 (2001)].

The Stark-shift measurements imply an upper limit on the weak matrix element of $|W|\!<\!5$ Hz for the near-degenerate states ($10s \,\, ^2[3/2]_2^o$ and $6f \,\, ^2[5/2]_2$), which is in agreement with the presented calculations.

Circle packings on surfaces with projective structures and uniformization (Sadayoshi Kojima - 15 August, 2003)
We have shown that the cross ratio parameter space \mathcal{C}_Ïassociated with Ï, which can be identified with the set of all pairs of a projective structure and a circle packing on it with nerve isotopic to Ï, is homeomorphic to \mathbb{R}^{6g-6}, and moreover that the forgetting map of \mathcal{C}_Ïto the space of projective structures is injective

Spin 0 and spin 1/2 particles in a constant scalar-curvature background (M. Alimohammadi - 30 June, 2003)
This metric has a constant scalar curvature R=6g^2 and is produced by a perfect fluid with equation of state p=-Ï/3

Geometric Cone Surfaces and (2+1)- Gravity coupled to Particles (Riccardo Benedetti - 13 April, 2000)
When the values of the masses are sufficiently large and the cone points are suitably spaced, the distinguished deformations of hyperbolic suspensions determine a relevant open subset of the full parameter space; this open subset is homeomorphic to the product of an Euclidean space of dimension 6g-6+2r with an open subset of the TeichmÃ¼ller Space of Riemann surfaces of genus g with r punctures

Simple curves on surfaces (Igor Rivin - 27 July, 1999)
We show that the number of simple closed geodesics of length bounded by L on a hyperbolic surface of genus g with c cusps and b boundary components grows roughly like L^{6g+2b+2c-6}

$\La \to 0$ limit of 2+1 Quantum Gravity for arbitrary genus (J. E. Nelson - 13 April, 1995)
The algebra splits into two sets with an explicit phase space representation;~one set consists of $6g-6$ {\it commuting} elements which form a basis for an algebraic manifold defined by the trace and rank identities;~the other set consists of $6g-6$ tangent vectors to this manifold

The 3d effective field theory of the high temperature abelian Higgs model (Vidyut Jain - 11 September, 1992)
We find for the three cases a) $6g^2/Î»=0(1)$, b) $6g^2/Î»=0(N)$ and c) $6g^2/Î»=O(N^{2\over3})$ the following results: a) The O(N)+O(1) potential admits only a second order phase transition, b) The O(1) potential admits a first order transition and c) the O(N^{1\over3}) +O(1) result gives a first order transition whose strength diminshes with N.
