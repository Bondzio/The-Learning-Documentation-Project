AKARI/IRC Near-Infrared Asteroid Spectroscopic Survey: AcuA-spec (Fumihiko Usui - 9 October, 2018)
We conducted a spectroscopic survey of asteroids in the 3-$\micron$ band using the Infrared Camera (IRC) on board the Japanese infrared satellite AKARI. In the warm mission period of AKARI, 147 pointed observations were performed for 66 asteroids in the grism mode for wavelengths from 2.5 to 5 $\micron$. According to these observations, most C-complex asteroids have clear absorption features ($> 10\%$ with respect to the continuum) related to hydrated minerals at a peak wavelength of approximately 2.75 $\micron$, while S-complex asteroids have no significant feature in this wavelength range

Kyoto's Event-Driven X-ray Astronomy SOI pixel sensor for the FORCE mission (Takeshi G. Tsuru - 29 July, 2018)
We have been developing monolithic active pixel sensors, X-ray Astronomy SOI pixel sensors, XRPIXs, based on a Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) CMOS technology as soft X-ray sensors for a future Japanese mission, FORCE (Focusing On Relativistic universe and Cosmic Evolution). The mission is characterized by broadband (1-80 keV) X-ray imaging spectroscopy with high angular resolution ($<15$~arcsec), with which we can achieve about ten times higher sensitivity in comparison to the previous missions above 10~keV. It allows us to do fast timing observation and also reduces non-X-ray background dominating at a high X-ray energy band above 5--10~keV by adopting an anti-coincidence technique

Multiband Gravitational-Wave Astronomy: Observing binary inspirals with a decihertz detector, B-DECIGO (Soichiro Isoyama - 8 August, 2018)
An evolving Japanese gravitational-wave (GW) mission in the deci-Hz band: B-DECIGO (DECihertz laser Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory) will enable us to detect GW150914-like binary black holes, GW170817-like binary neutron stars, and intermediate-mass binary black holes out to cosmological distances. Using non-precessing post-Newtonian waveforms with the Fisher matrix approach, we find for systems like GW150914 and GW170817 that B-DECIGO can measure the mass ratio to within $< 0.1\%$, the individual black-hole spins to within $< 10\%$, and the coalescence time to within $< 5\,$s about a week before alerting aLIGO and electromagnetic facilities. Prior information from B-DECIGO for aLIGO can further reduce the uncertainty in the measurement of, e.g., certain neutron star tidally-induced deformations by factor of $\sim 6$, and potentially determine the spin-induced neutron star quadrupole moment

We have observed Itokawa in optical wave- length (R-band) with the 1.05-m Schmidt telescope at the Kiso Observatory, the 2.24-m telescope of University of Hawaii, and the 1.05-m telescope at the Misato Observatory since 2001. From the analysis of the data, we present the relationship between brightness and the solar phase angle, 6.9 to 87.8 deg. We obtained the absolute magnitude H_R(0) = 19.09+-0.37, and the slope parameter G_R = 0.25 +- 0.29. The rotational period of Itokawa is 12.1324 +- 0.0001 hours.

Empirical observations of ultraslow diffusion driven by the fractional dynamics in languages: Dynamical statistical properties of word counts of already popular words (Hayafumi Watanabe - 29 June, 2018)
In this paper, firstly, we find the ultraslow-like diffusion of the time-series of word counts of already popular words by analysing three different nationwide language databases: (i) newspaper articles (Japanese), (ii) blog articles (Japanese), and (iii) page views of Wikipedia (English, French, Chinese, and Japanese). Secondly, we use theoretical analysis to show that this diffusion is basically explained by the random walk model with the power-law forgetting with the exponent $Î²\approx 0.5$, which is related to the fractional Langevin equation. The exponent $Î²$ characterises the speed of forgetting and $Î²\approx 0.5$ corresponds to (i) the border (or thresholds) between the stationary and the nonstationary and (ii) the right-in-the-middle dynamics between the IID noise for $Î²=1$ and the normal random walk for $Î²=0$

Cosmic star formation history revealed by AKARI and Hyper Suprime-Cam (Tomo Goto - 6 December, 2017)
Japanese infrared satellite, AKARI, provided unique data sets to probe this both at low and high redshift; the AKARI all sky survey in 6 bands (9-160 $Î¼$m), and the AKARI NEP survey in 9 bands (2-24$Î¼$m). The AKARI performed all sky survey in 6 IR bands (9, 18, 65, 90, 140, and 160 $Î¼$m) with 3-10 times better sensitivity than IRAS, covering the crucial far-IR wavelengths across the peak of the dust emission. In the AKARI NEP wide field, AKARI has obtained deep images in the mid-infrared (IR), covering 5.4 deg$^2$. However, our previous work was limited to the central area of 0.25 deg$^2$ due to the lack of deep optical coverage. To rectify the situation, we used the newly advent Subaru telescope's Hyper Suprime-Cam to obtain deep optical images over the entire 5.4 deg$^2$ of the AKARI NEP wide field.

Ground-based Characterization of Hayabusa2 Mission Target Asteroid 162173 Ryugu: Constraining Mineralogical Composition in Preparation for Spacecraft Operations (Lucille Le Corre - 8 December, 2017)
One such object is near-Earth asteroid (NEA) (162173) Ryugu, which is the target of the Japanese Space Agency's (JAXA) Hayabusa2 sample return mission.

Our spectral analysis has found a near-perfect match between our spectrum of Ryugu and those of NEA (85275) 1994 LY and Mars-crossing asteroid (316720) 1998 BE7, suggesting that their surface regoliths have similar composition. We compared Ryugu's spectrum with that of main belt asteroid (302) Clarissa, the largest asteroid in the Clarissa asteroid family, suggested as a possible source of Ryugu by Campins et al

Iwahashi Zenbei's Sunspot Drawings in 1793 in Japan (Hisashi Hayakawa - 22 November, 2017)
Three Japanese sunspot drawings associated with Iwahashi Zenbei (1756-1811) are shown here from contemporary manuscripts and woodprint documents with the relevant texts. We revealed the observational date of one of the drawings to be 26 August 1793, and the overall observations lasted for over a year. We then compared his observations with group sunspot number and raw group count from Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO) to reveal its data context, and concluded that these drawings filled the gaps in understanding due to the fragmental sunspots observations around 1793. These drawings are important as a clue to evaluate astronomical knowledge of contemporary Japan in the late 19 th century and are valuable as a non-European observation, considering that most sunspot observations up to mid-19 th century are from Europe.

We analyzed the thermal emission from IDPs that was observed by the first Japanese infrared astronomical satellite, AKARI. The observed surface brightness in the trailing direction of the Earth orbit is 3.7% greater than that in the leading direction in the $9{\rm Î¼m}$ band and 3.0% in the $18{\rm Î¼m}$ band. The leading-trailing surface brightness difference integrated over the size distribution of the asteroidal dust is obtained to be the values of 27.7% and 25.3% in the $9{\rm Î¼m}$ and $18{\rm Î¼m}$ bands, respectively. In contrast, the brightness difference for cometary dust is calculated as the values of 3.6% and 3.1% in the $9{\rm Î¼m}$ and $18{\rm Î¼m}$ bands, respectively, if the maximum dust radius is set to be $s_{\rm max} = 3000{\rm Î¼m}$. Taking into account these values and their errors, we conclude that the contribution of asteroidal dust to the zodiacal infrared emission is less than ~10%, while cometary dust of the order of 1 mm mainly accounts for the zodiacal light in infrared.

J-GEM Follow-Up Observations of The Gravitational Wave Source GW151226 (Michitoshi Yoshida - 4 November, 2016)
We report the results of optical--infrared follow-up observations of the gravitational wave (GW) event GW151226 detected by the Advanced LIGO in the framework of J-GEM (Japanese collaboration for Gravitational wave ElectroMagnetic follow-up). The KWFC survey started at 2.26 days after the GW event and covered 778 deg$^2$ centered at the high Galactic region of the skymap of GW151226. We started the HSC follow-up observations from 12 days after the event and covered an area of 63.5 deg$^2$ of the highest probability region of the northern sky with the limiting magnitudes of 24.6 and 23.8 for i band and z band, respectively. MOA-cam3 covered 145 deg$^2$ of the skymap with MOA-red filter 2.5 months after the GW alert. Total area covered by the wide-field surveys was 986.5 deg$^2$. The integrated detection probability of all the observed area was $\sim$29%. We also performed galaxy-targeted observations with six optical and near-infrared telescopes from 1.61 days after the event. Total of 238 nearby (<100 Mpc) galaxies were observed with the typical I band limiting magnitude of $\sim$19.5. We detected 13 supernova candidates with the KWFC survey, and 60 extragalactic transients with the HSC survey

X-ray and infrared diagnostics of nearby active galactic nuclei with MAXI and AKARI (Naoki Isobe - 25 August, 2016)
Nearby active galactic nuclei were diagnosed in the X-ray and mid-to-far infrared wavelengths, with Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) and the Japanese infrared observatory AKARI, respectively. Among the X-ray sources listed in the second release of the MAXI all-sky X-ray source catalog, 100 ones are currently identified as a non-blazar-type active galactic nucleus. These include 95 Seyfert galaxies and 5 quasars, and they are composed of 73 type-1 and 27 type-2 objects. The AKARI all-sky survey point source catalog was searched for their mid- and far-infrared counterparts at 9, 18, and 90 $Î¼$m. As a result, 69 Seyfert galaxies in the MAXI catalog (48 type-1 and 21 type-2 ones) were found to be detected with AKARI. Adopting the canonical photon index, $Î= 1.9$, of the intrinsic X-ray spectrum of the Seyfert galaxies, the X-ray hardness ratio between the 3-4 and 4-10 keV ranges derived with MAXI was roughly converted into the absorption column density. In contrast, NGC 1365, only one Compton-thick object in the MAXI catalog, was found to deviate from the correlation toward a significantly lower X-ray luminosity by nearly an order of magnitude. It was verified that the relation between the X-ray hardness below 10 keV and X-ray-to-infrared color acts as an effective tool to pick up Compton-thick objects

AC bias characterization of low noise bolometers for SAFARI using an Open-Loop Frequency Domain SQUID-based multiplexer operating between 1 and 5 MHz (Luciano Gottardi - 9 April, 2016)
SRON is developing the Frequency Domain Multiplexing (FDM) readout and the ultra low NEP TES bolometers array for the infrared spectrometer SAFARI on board of the Japanese space mission SPICA. For single pixel characterization under AC bias we are developing a simple FDM system working in the frequency range from 1 to 5 MHz, based on the open loop read-out of a linearized two-stage SQUID amplifier and high Q lithographic LC resonators. We describe the details of the experimental set-up required to achieve low power loading (< 1 fW) and low noise (NEP $\sim 10^{-19} W/Hz^{1/2}$) in the TES bolometers. We conclude the paper by comparing the performance of a $4 \cdot 10^{-19} W/Hz^{1/2}$ TES bolometer measured under DC and AC bias.

CALET (CALorimetric Electron Telescope) is a high energy astroparticle physics experiment planned for a long exposure mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS) by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, in collaboration with the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and NASA. The main science goal is high precision measurements of the inclusive electron (+positron) spectrum below 1 TeV and the exploration of the energy region above 1 TeV, where the shape of the high end of the spectrum might unveil the presence of nearby sources of acceleration. CALET has been designed to achieve a large proton rejection capability (>10$^5$) with a fine grained imaging calorimeter (IMC) followed by a total absorption calorimeter (TASC), for a total thickness of 30 X$_{0}$ and 1.3 proton interaction length. CALET will also measure the high energy spectra and relative abundance of cosmic nuclei from proton to iron and detect trans-iron elements up to Z$\sim$40. CALET will also contribute to clarify the present experimental picture on the energy dependence of the boron/carbon ratio, below and above 1 TeV/n, thereby providing valuable information on cosmic-ray propagation in the galaxy

Concurrent Bursty Behavior of Social Sensors in Sporting Events (Yuki Takeichi - 30 November, 2015)

We also show that these findings hold true across cultures by analyzing tweets related to Major League Baseball games in 2015

A transient event in AD 775 reported by al-Tabari: A bolide - not a nova, supernova, or kilonova (Ralph Neuhaeuser - 3 September, 2014)
Given that the cause for the strong increase in 14C in AD 774/5 in Japanese and German trees is still a matter of debate (e.g. The group around caliph al-Mansur observed a transient event while on the way from Baghdad to Mecca on AD 775 Aug 29 - Sep 1 (Julian calendar). The reports use the Arabic words kawkab and athar(uhu), which were also used in the known Arabic reports about supernovae SN 1006 and 1054, so that one might consider an interpretation as a nova-like event. The kawkab (celestial object) was observed only during the morning twilight at a brightness of probably between about -3 and 0 mag. Such a brightness and time-scale would be expected for optical kilonovae (at 3 to 9 kpc) in the context of short Gamma-Ray Bursts

The Chinese comet observation in AD 773 January (Jesse Chapman - 13 August, 2014)
The strong 14C increase in the year AD 774/5 detected in one German and two Japanese trees was recently suggested to have been caused by an impact of a comet onto Earth and a deposition of large amounts of 14C into the atmosphere (Liu et al. 2014). The authors supported their claim using a report of a historic Chinese observation of a comet ostensibly colliding with Earth's atmosphere in AD 773 January. According to the original sources, the Chinese observed a comet in mid January 773, but they report neither a collision nor a large coma, just a long tail. Ho (1962) reports sightings of this comet in China on AD 773 Jan 15 and/or 17 and in Japan on AD 773 Jan 20 (Ho 1962). Therefore, postulating a sudden increase in 14C in corals off the Chinese coast precisely in mid January 773 (Liu et al. 2014) is not justified given just the 230Th dating for AD 783 \pm 14.

The First Source Counts at 18 microns from the AKARI NEP Survey (Chris Pearson - 7 August, 2014)
We present the first galaxy counts at 18 microns using the Japanese AKARI satellite's survey at the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP), produced from the images from the NEP-Deep and NEP-Wide surveys covering 0.6 and 5.8 square degrees respectively. The final source counts are complete and reliable over three orders of magnitude in flux density, resulting in sensitivities (80 percent completeness) of 0.15mJy and 0.3mJy for the NEP-Deep and NEP-Wide surveys respectively, a factor of 1.3 deeper than previous catalogues constructed from this field. The differential source counts exhibit a characteristic upturn from Euclidean expectations at around a milliJansky and a corresponding evolutionary bump between 0.2-0.4 mJy consistent with previous mid-infrared surveys with ISO and Spitzer at 15 and 24 microns. Integrating our source counts down to the limit of the NEP survey at the 150 microJy level we calculate that AKARI has resolved approximately 55 percent of the 18 micron cosmic infrared background relative to the predictions of contemporary source count models.

Our analysis is performed for each calendar year during the time period from 1980 to 2011. Specifically, we obtain communities of banks and networks for each of the 32 investigated years, and we introduce a method to track the time evolution of these communities on a statistical basis. In our 32 year long analysis we detect a persistence of the over-expression of attributes of clusters of banks and firms together with a slow dynamics of changes from some specific attributes to new ones

This corresponds to a high-energy event happened within one year that input $Î³$-ray energy about 7$\times{}$10$^{24}$erg to the Earth, leaving the origin a mystery. We searched Chinese historical materials around AD 744-775 and AD 992-993, but no remarkable event was found except a violent thunderstorm in AD 775.

Trigonometric Parallaxes of High Mass Star Forming Regions: the Structure and Kinematics of the Milky Way (M. J. Reid - 28 January, 2014)
Over 100 trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions for masers associated with young, high-mass stars have been measured with the BeSSeL Survey, a VLBA key science project, the EVN, and the Japanese VERA project. These measurements provide strong evidence for the existence of spiral arms in the Milky Way, accurately locating many arm segments and yielding spiral pitch angles ranging from 7 to 20 degrees. Fitting axially symmetric models of the Milky Way with the 3-D position and velocity information and conservative priors for the solar and average source peculiar motions, we estimate the distance to the Galactic center, Ro, to be 8.34 +/- 0.16 kpc, a circular rotation speed at the Sun, To, to be 240 +/- 8 km/s, and a rotation curve that is nearly flat (a slope of -0.2 +/- 0.4 km/s/kpc) between Galactocentric radii of 5 and 16 kpc. Assuming a "universal" spiral galaxy form for the rotation curve, we estimate the thin disk scale length to be 2.44 +/- 0.16 kpc. Adopting a theoretically motivated prior that high-mass star forming regions are in nearly circular Galactic orbits, we estimate a global solar motion component in the direction of Galactic rotation, Vsun = 14.6 +/- 5.0 km/s. While To and Vsun are significantly correlated, the sum of these parameters is well constrained, To + Vsun = 255.2 +/- 5.1 km/s, as is the angular speed of the Sun in its orbit about the Galactic center, (To + Vsun)/Ro = 30.57 +/- 0.43 km/s/kpc

However, in this previous study, we could not specifically identify what types of structure properties (or correlations) of the network determine the 1.3 exponent. Using theoretical analysis, we obtained the mean-field solution of the model and found that, in the case of the Japanese firms, the scaling exponent of 1.3 can be determined from the power law of the average degree of the nearest neighbours of the network with an exponent of -0.7.

Rotating and infalling motion around the high-mass young stellar object Cepheus A-HW2 observed with the methanol maser at 6.7 GHz (K. Sugiyama - 27 December, 2013)
We conducted three epochs of VLBI monitoring observations of the 6.7 GHz methanol masers in Cep A-HW2 with the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN) over the period between 2006-2008. In 2006, we were able to use phase-referencing to measure the absolute coordinates of the maser emission with an accuracy of a few milliarcseconds. We measured the internal proper motions for 29 methanol maser spots, of which 19 were identified at all three epochs and the remaining ten at only two epochs. The magnitude of proper motions ranged from 0.2 to 7.4 km/s, with an average of 3.1 km/s. The derived rotation and infall velocities at the disk radius of 680 au are 0.5 +- 0.7 and 1.8 +- 0.7 km/s, respectively. Assuming that the modeled disk motion accurately represents the accretion disk around the Cep A-HW2 high-mass YSO, we estimated the mass infall rate to be 3 x 10^{-4} n_8 Msun/yr (n_8 is the gas volume density in units of 10^{8} cm^{-3}). The infall momentum rate is estimated to be 5 x 10^{-4} n_8 Msun/yr km/s, which is larger than the estimated stellar radiation pressure of the HW2 object, supporting the hypothesis that this object is in an active gas accretion phase.

Internal Motion of 6.7-GHz Methanol Masers in H II Region S269 (Satoko Sawada-Satoh - 11 July, 2013)
We present the first internal motion measurement of the 6.7-GHz methanol maser within S269, a small HII region in the outer Galaxy, which was carried out in 2006 and 2011 using the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN). Several maser groups and weak isolated spots were detected in an area spanning by ~200 mas (1000 AU). Three remarkable maser groups are aligned at a position angle of 80 degree. Two of three maser groups were also detected by a previous observation in 1998, which allowed us to study a long-term position variation of maser spots from 1998 to 2011. The angular separation between the two groups increased ~10 mas, which corresponds to an expansion velocity of ~10 km s^{-1}. Some velocity gradient (~10^{-2} km s^{-1} mas^{-1}) in the overall distribution was found

Reactor On-Off Antineutrino Measurement with KamLAND ( The KamLAND Collaboration - 19 March, 2013)
The recent long-term shutdown of Japanese nuclear reactors has resulted in a significantly reduced reactor $\bar{nu}_{e}$ flux at KamLAND. The data set also has improved sensitivity for other $\bar{nu}_{e}$ signals, in particular $\bar{nu}_{e}$'s produced in $Î²$-decays from $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th within the Earth's interior, whose energy spectrum overlaps with that of reactor $\bar{nu}_{e}$'s. Including constraints on $Î¸_{13}$ from accelerator and short-baseline reactor neutrino experiments, a combined three-flavor analysis of solar and KamLAND data gives fit values for the oscillation parameters of $tan^{2} Î¸_{12} = 0.436^{+0.029}_{-0.025}$, $Îm^{2}_{21} = 7.53^{+0.18}_{-0.18} \times 10^{-5} {eV}^{2}$, and $sin^{2} Î¸_{13} = 0.023^{+0.002}_{-0.002}$. Assuming a chondritic Th/U mass ratio, we obtain $116^{+28}_{-27}$ $\bar{nu}_{e}$ events from $^{238}$U and $^{232}$Th, corresponding to a geo $\bar{nu}_{e}$ flux of $3.4^{+0.8}_{-0.8} \times 10^{6} {cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$ at the KamLAND location

We find that the ratio of the EW of the Cr emission line to that of Fe ($\EWR\equiv \EWCr/\EWFe$) provides useful constraints on the SNR progenitors and on the SN explosion mechanisms: for SNRs with $\EWR > 2%$, a type Ia origin is favored (e.g., N103B, G344.7-0.1, 3C\,397 and 0519-69.0); for SNRs with $\EWR < 2%$, they could be of either core-collpase origin or carbon-deflagration Ia origin.

Indirect Probes of Supersymmetry Breaking in the JEM-EUSO Observatory (Ivone F. M. Albuquerque - 10 January, 2013)
In this paper we propose indirect probes of the scale of supersymmetry breaking, through observations in the Extreme Universe Space Observatory onboard Japanese Experiment Module (JEM-EUSO). We demonstrate that JEM-EUSO will be able to probe models where the NLSP decays, therefore probing supersymmetric breaking scales below $5 \times 10^6$ GeV. This is complementary to a previous proposal (Albuquerque et al., 2004) where it was shown that 1 Km$^3$ neutrino telescopes can directly probe this scale

AKARI Far-Infrared All-Sky Survey Maps (Yasuo Doi - 19 September, 2012)
We present the first all-sky image from a sensitive all-sky survey using the Japanese AKARI satellite, in the wavelength range 50 -- 180 um. Covering >99% of the sky in four photometric bands with four filters centred at 65 um, 90 um, 140 um, and 160 um wavelengths, this achieved spatial resolutions from 1 to 2 arcmin and a detection limit of <10 MJy sr-1, with absolute and relative photometric accuracies of <20%. We show that the temperature of dust particles in thermal equilibrium with the ambient interstellar radiation field can be estimated by using 90 um, 140 um, and 160 um data

Possible Detection of Apparent Superluminal inward motion in Markarian 421 after the Giant X-ray flare in February, 2010 (K. Niinuma - 11 September, 2012)
We report on the VLBI follow-up observations using the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN) array at 22 GHz for the largest X-ray flare of TeV blazar Mrk 421 that occurred in mid-February, 2010. The total of five epochs of observations were performed at intervals of about 20 days between March 7 and May 31, 2010. In this case, the obtained Doppler factor of the new component is around 10 to 20, which is consistent with the ones typically estimated by model fittings of spectral energy distribution for this source.

Possible Detection of an Emission Cyclotron Resonance Scattering Feature from the Accretion-powered Pulsar 4U 1626-67 (W. B. Iwakiri - 8 May, 2012)
We present analysis of 4U 1626-67, a 7.7 s pulsar in a low-mass X-ray binary system, observed with the hard X-ray detector of the Japanese X-ray satellite Suzaku in March 2006 for a net exposure of \sim88 ks. The phase-averaged spectrum is reproduced well by combining a negative and positive power-law times exponential cutoff (NPEX) model modified at \sim 37 keV by a cyclotron resonance scattering feature (CRSF). The statistical significance of this result, evaluated by means of an F-test, is between 2.91 x 10^-3 and 1.53 x 10^-5, taking into account the systematic errors in the background evaluation of HXD-PIN

Brightness and Fluctuation of the Mid-Infrared Sky from AKARI Observations towards the North Ecliptic Pole (Jeonghyun Pyo - 24 August, 2012)
We present the smoothness of the mid-infrared sky from observations by the Japanese infrared astronomical satellite AKARI. AKARI monitored the north ecliptic pole (NEP) during its cold phase with nine wavebands covering from 2.4 to 24 micron, out of which six mid-infrared bands were used in this study. The fluctuations at a few arcminutes scales at short mid-infrared wavelengths (7, 9, and 11 micron) are largely caused by the diffuse Galactic light of the interstellar dust cirrus. At long mid-infrared wavelengths (15, 18, and 24 micron), photon noise is the dominant source of fluctuation over the scale from arcseconds to a few arcminutes. The residual fluctuation amplitude at 200 arcseconds after removing these contributions is at most 1.04 +/- 0.23 nW m^-2 sr^-1 or 0.05% of the brightness at 24 micron and at least 0.47 +/- 0.14 nW m^-2 sr^-1 or 0.02% at 18 micron. We conclude that the upper limit of the fluctuation in the zodiacal light towards the NEP is 0.03% of the sky brightness, taking 2Ï error into account.

The radial velocity of the star exhibits a periodic Keplerian variation with a period, semi-amplitude and eccentricity of 157.57 d, 35.2 m s^-1 and 0.085, respectively. Adopting an estimated stellar mass of 2.4 M_Sun, we confirmed the presence of a planetary companion with a semi-major axis of 0.76 AU and a minimum mass of 1.7 M_Jup.

Identification of Bursting Water Maser Features in Orion KL (Tomoya Hirota - 19 August, 2011)
We have carried out astrometric observations of the bursting H$_{2}$O maser features in Orion KL with VERA (VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry), a Japanese VLBI network dedicated for astrometry. The total flux of the bursting feature at the LSR velocity of 7.58 km s$^{-1}$ reaches 4.4$\times10^{4}$ Jy in March 2011. The intensity of the bursting feature is three orders of magnitudes larger than that of the same velocity feature in the quiescent phase in 2006. Two months later, another new feature appears at the LSR velocity of 6.95 km s$^{-1}$ in May 2011, separated by 12 mas north of the 7.58 km s$^{-1}$ feature. The bursting masers are elongated along the northwest-southeast direction as reported in the previous burst in 1998. It is most likely that the outflow from the radio source I or another young stellar object interacting with the Compact Ridge is a possible origin of the H$_{2}$O maser burst.

Horizontal flow fields observed in Hinode G-band images. I. Methods (M. Verma - 14 March, 2011)
Aims: Systematic studies based on G-band data from the Japanese Hinode mission provide the means to gather statistical properties of horizontal flow fields. In total about 200 time-series with a duration between 1-16 h and a cadence between 15-90 s were analyzed. Selecting both a high-cadence (dt = 15 s) and a long-duration (dT = 16 h) time-series enabled us to optimize and validate the LCT input parameters, hence, ensuring a robust, reliable, uniform, and accurate processing of a huge data volume. The most reliable and yet detailed flow maps are produced using a Gaussian kernel with a size of 2560 km x 2560 km and a full-width-at-half-maximum (FWHM) of 1200 km (corresponding to the size of a typical granule) as sampling window.

We present galaxy counts at 15 microns using the Japanese AKARI satellite's NEP-deep and NEP-wide legacy surveys at the North Ecliptic Pole. The total number of sources detected are approximately 6700 and 10,700 down to limiting fluxes of 117 and 250 microJy (5 sigma) for the NEP-deep and NEP-wide survey respectively. We construct the Euclidean normalized differential source counts for both data sets (assuming 80 percent completeness levels of 200 and 270 microJy respectively) to produce the widest and deepest contiguous survey at 15 microns to date covering the entire flux range from the deepest to shallowest surveys made with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) over areas sufficiently significant to overcome cosmic variance, detecting six times as many sources as the largest survey carried out with ISO.We compare the results from AKARI with the previous surveys with ISO at the same wavelength and the Spitzer observations at 16 microns using the peek-up camera on its IRS instrument. We find the the AKARI source counts show a slight excess at fluxes fainter than 200 microJanskys which is not predicted by previous source count models at 15 microns. At brighter fluxes greater than a milliJansky, the NEP-wide survey source counts agree with the Northern ISO-ELAIS field results, resolving the discrepancy of the bright end calibration in the ISO 15 micron source counts.

It is found that independently of the photospheric wave amplitude and magnetic field a corona can be produced and maintained only for long (> 80 Mm) and thick (area ratio between photosphere and corona > 500) loops

Spitzer observations of the asteroid-comet transition object and potential spacecraft target 107P (4015) Wilson-Harrington (J. Licandro - 1 October, 2009)
Near-Earth asteroid-comet transition object 107P/ (4015) Wilson-Harrington is a possible target of the joint European Space Agency (ESA) and Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) Marco Polo sample return mission. We present mid-infrared photometry in two filters (16 and 22 microns) obtained with NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope on February 12, 2007, and results from the application of the Near Earth Asteroid Thermal Model (NEATM).We obtained high S/N in two mid-IR bands allowing accurate measurements of its thermal emission. We obtain a well constrained beaming parameter (eta = 1.39 +/- 0.26) and obtain a diameter and geometric albedo of D = 3.46 +/- 0.32 km, and pV = 0.059 +/- 0.011. The albedo of 4015 Wilson-Harrington is low, consistent with those of comet nuclei and primitive C-, P-, D-type asteorids. We establish a rough lower limit for the thermal inertia of W-H of 60 Jm^-2s^(-0.5)K^-1 when it is at r=1AU, which is slightly over the limit of 30 Jm^-2s^(-0.5)K-1 derived by Groussin et al

JEM-EUSO Science Objectives (Gustavo Medina-Tanco - 21 September, 2009)
JEM-EUSO, on board of the Japanese Exploration Module of the International Space Station, is being proposed as the first space observatory devoted to UHECR. Its privileged position at 430 km above the Earth surface, combined with a large field of view, innovative optics and a high efficiency focal surface, results in an unprecedented exposure which significantly surpasses that of the largest ground observatories. Furthermore, the atmospheric target volume ($\sim 10^{12}$ ton) makes the possibility of neutrino observation a highlight of the mission

On-disk counterparts of type II spicules in the Ca II 854.2 nm and Halpha lines (L. Rouppe van der Voort - 11 September, 2009)
Recently a second type of spicules was discovered at the solar limb with the Solar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard the Japanese Hinode spacecraft. Here we report on the discovery of the disk counterparts of type II spicules using spectral imaging data in the Ca II 854.2 nm and Halpha lines with the CRisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter (CRISP) at the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST) in La Palma. We find rapid blueward excursions in the line profiles of both chromospheric lines that correspond to thin, jet-like features that show apparent velocities of order 50 km/s. These blueward excursions seem to form a separate absorbing component with Doppler shifts of order 20 and 50 km/s for the Ca II 854.2 nm and Halpha line respectively

Early Science Result from the Japanese Virtual Observatory: AGN and Galaxy Clustering at z = 0.3 to 3.0 (Yuji Shirasaki - 6 November, 2010)
The Japanese Virtual Observatory (JVO) was used to obtain the Subaru Suprime-Cam images and UKIDSS catalog data around AGNs. We investigated 1,809 AGNs, which is about ten times larger a sample than that used in previous studies on AGN-galaxy clustering at redshifts larger than 0.6. 90% of the AGN samples are optically-selected AGN from the SDSS and 2dF catalogs. We found significant excess of galaxies around the AGNs at redshifts from 0.3 to 1.8. For the low redshift samples ($z<0.9$), we obtained correlation length of $r_{0} = $5--6 $h^{-1}$Mpc ($Î³= 1.8$), which indicates that the AGNs at this redshift range reside in a similar environment around typical local galaxies. We also found that AGNs at higher redshift ranges reside in a denser environment than lower redshift AGNs; For $z=1.3 \sim 1.8$ AGNs, the cross correlation length was measured as 11$^{+6}_{-3}$ $h^{-1}$Mpc ($Î³=1.8$)

The radial velocity of this star exhibits a periodic Keplerian variation with a period, semi-amplitude and eccentricity of 410.2 days, 413.5 m/s and 0.082, respectively. Adopting a stellar mass of 3.9 M_solar, we were able to confirm the presence of a massive substellar companion with a semimajor axis of 1.71 AU and a minimum mass of 37.6 M_Jup, which falls in the middle of the brown dwarf-mass region.

Estimation of the Hubble Constant and Constraint on Descriptions of Dark Energy (Lincoln Greenhill - 24 February, 2009)
A space-VLBI aperture may be required, thus motivating US participation in the Japanese VSOP-2 mission (launch c.2013). There are now 5 good targets at z>0.02, out of ~100 known masers. A single-dish discovery survey of >10,000 nuclei (>2500 hours on the GBT) would build a sample of tens of potential distance anchors. Beyond 2020, a high-frequency SKA could provide larger maser samples, enabling estimation of H0 from individually less accurate distances, and possibly without the need for peculiar motion corrections.

Trigonometric Parallaxes of Massive Star Forming Regions: VI. Galactic Structure, Fundamental Parameters and Non-Circular Motions (M. J. Reid - 1 May, 2009)
We are using the VLBA and the Japanese VERA project to measure trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions of masers found in high-mass star-forming regions across the Milky Way. Early results from 18 sources locate several spiral arms. The Perseus spiral arm has a pitch angle of 16 +/- 3 degrees, which favors four rather than two spiral arms for the Galaxy. By fitting the measurements to a model of the Galaxy, we estimate the distance to the Galactic center R_o = 8.4 +/- 0.6 kpc and a circular rotation speed Theta_o = 254 +/- 16 km/s. The ratio Theta_o/R_o can be determined to higher accuracy than either parameter individually, and we find it to be 30.3 +/- 0.9 km/s/kpc, in good agreement with the angular rotation rate determined from the proper motion of Sgr A*. Kinematic distances are generally too large, sometimes by factors greater than two; they can be brought into better agreement with the trigonometric parallaxes by increasing Theta_o/R_o from the IAU recommended value of 25.9 km/s/kpc to a value near 30 km/s/kpc

We have used the Japanese VLBI array VERA to perform high-precision astrometry of an H2O maser source in the Galactic star-forming region NGC 281 West, which has been considered to be part of a 300-pc superbubble.

The source distance as well as the absolute proper motions were used to demonstrate the 3D structure and expansion of the NGC 281 superbubble, ~650 pc in size parallel to the Galactic disk and with a shape slightly elongated along the disk or spherical, but not vertically elongated, indicating the superbubble expansion may be confined to the disk

We indentified five spectral features, which are grouped into red-shifted (-1.9 and -2.7 km/s) and blue-shifted (-3.8, -4.2, and -4.9 km/s), and we detected rapid variabilities of these maser features within a monitoring period of 81 days. The red-shifted features decreased in flux density to 50% of its initial value, while the flux density of the blue-shifted features rapidly increased within a 30 days. The spatial distribution of the maser spots obtained by the JVN observation showed an arclike structure with a scale of $\sim$1400 AU, and separations of the five maser features were found to be larger than 100 AU

VLBI Observations of Water Masers in Onsala 1: Massive Binary Star Forming Site? (Takumi Nagayama - 8 November, 2007)
We present proper motions of water masers toward the Onsala 1 star forming region, observed with the Japanese VLBI network at three epochs spanning 290 days. We found that there are two water maser clusters (WMC1 and WMC2) separated from each other by 1".6 (2900 AU at a distance of 1.8 kpc). WMC1 and WMC2 are associated with two 345 GHz continuum dust emission sources, and located 2" (3600 AU) east from the core of an ultracompact HII region traced by 8.4 GHz radio continuum emission. This indicates that star formation activity of Onsala 1 could move from the west side of ultracompact HII region to the east side of two young stellar objects associated with the water masers. Their relative velocity along the line of sight is 3 km/s, and total mass is 37 Mo. Onsala 1 seems to harbor a binary star at different evolutionary stage.

The VSOP Survey: Final individual results + Final aggregate results (R. Dodson - 20 December, 2006)
In February 1997 the Japanese radio astronomy satellite HALCA was launched to provide the space-borne element for the VSOP mission. Twenty-five percent of the scientific time of the mission was devoted to the ``VSOP survey'' of bright, compact, extra-galactic radio sources at 5 GHz. A complete list of 294 survey targets were selected from pre-launch surveys, 91% of which were observed during the satellite's lifetime

Direct detection of exoplanet host star companion gamma Cep B and revised masses for both stars and the sub-stellar object (Ralph Neuhaeuser - 14 November, 2006)
We use the Adaptive Optics camera CIAO at the Japanese 8m telescope Subaru on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, with the semi-transparent coronograph to block most of the light from the bright primary gamma Cep A, and to detect at the same time the faint companion B. We use a photometric standard star to determine the magnitude of B after PSF subtraction in the Subaru image, and the magnitude difference between A and B in the Calar Alto images, and find an average value of K = 7.3 \pm 0.2 mag. The separations and position angles between A and B are measured on 15 July 2006 and 11 and 12 Sept 2006, B is slightly south of west of A. By combining the radial velocity, astrometric, and imaging data, we have refined the binary orbit and determined the dynamical masses of the two stars in the gamma Cep system, namely 1.40 \pm 0.12 M_sun for the primary and 0.409 \pm 0.018 M_sun for the secondary (consistent with being a M4 dwarf). We also determine the minimum mass of the sub-stellar companion to be M_p sin i = 1.60 \pm 0.13 M_Jup.

The VSOP 5-GHz AGN Survey: IV. The Angular Size/Brightness Temperature Distribution (S. Horiuchi - 3 July, 2004)
The VSOP (VLBI Space Observatory Programme) mission is a Japanese-led project to study radio sources with sub-milliarcsec angular resolution, using an orbiting 8-m telescope on board the satellite HALCA with a global earth-based array of telescopes. A major program is the 5 GHz VSOP Survey Program, which we supplement here with VLBA observations to produce a complete and flux-density limited sample. On average, the cores have a diameter (full-width, half-power) of 0.20 mas which contains about 20% of the total source emission, and (14+/-6)% of the cores are <0.04 mas in size. About (20+/-5)% of the radio cores have a source frame brightness temperature 10^{13}K, and (3+/-2)% have 10^{14}K. A model of the high brightness temperature tail suggests that the radio cores have a brightness temperatures approx 10^{12}K, and are beamed toward the observer with an average bulk motion of v/c=0.993 +/- 0.004.

Wide-Area Mapping of 155 Micron Continuum Emission from the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex (S. Arimura - 2 March, 2004)
We present the results of a wide-area mapping of the far-infrared continuum emission toward the Orion complex by using a Japanese balloon-borne telescope. The 155-um continuum emission was detected over a region of 1.5 deg^2 around the KL nebula with 3' resolution similar to that of the IRAS 100-um map. Assuming a single-temperature model of the thermal equilibrium dust, maps of the temperature and the optical depth were derived from the 155 um intensity and the IRAS 100 um intensity. The derived dust temperature is 5 - 15 K lower and the derived dust optical thickness were derived from the 155-um intensity and the IRAS 100-um intensity. The derived dust temperature is 5 - 15 K lower and the derived dust optical depth is 5 - 300 times larger than those derived from the IRAS 60 and 100-um intensities due to the significant contribution of the statistically heated very small grains to the IRAS 60-um intensity. The optical-thickness distribution shows a filamentary dust ridge that has a 1.5 degrees extent in the north - south direction and well resembles the Integral-Shaped Filament (ISF) molecular gas distribution. The gas-to-dust ratio derived from the CO molecular gas distribution along the ISF is in the range 30 - 200, which may be interpreted as being an effect of CO depletion due to the photodissociation and/or the freezing on dust grains.

We predict that ASTRO-F will detect of the order of 10's millions of sources in the far-infrared wavelength bands, most of which will be dusty LIG/ULIGs of which as many as half will lie at redshifts greater than unity. Furthermore, we investigate the large scale structure scales that will be accessed by ASTRO-F, discovering that ASTRO-F and SIRTF-SWIRE probe both different scales and redshift domains and concluding that the 2 missions will supplement rather than supplant one another.

The US 2000-2002 Market Descent: How Much Longer and Deeper? (D. Sornette - 3 September, 2002)
A remarkable similarity in the behavior of the US S&P500 index from 1996 to August 2002 and of the Japanese Nikkei index from 1985 to 1992 (11 years shift) is presented, with particular emphasis on the structure of the bearish phases. Extending a previous analysis of Johansen and Sornette [1999, 2000] on the Nikkei index ``anti-bubble'' based on a theory of cooperative herding and imitation working both in bullish as well as in bearish regimes, we demonstrate the existence of a clear signature of herding in the decay of the S&P500 index since August 2000 with high statistical significance, in the form of strong log-periodic components. We offer a detailed analysis of what could be the future evolution of the S&P500 index over the next two years, according to three versions of the theory: we expect an overall continuation of the bearish phase, punctuated by local rallies; we predict an overall increasing market until the end of the year 2002 or at the beginning of 2003 (first quarter); we predict a strong following descent (with maybe one or two severe up and downs in the middle) which stops during the first semester of 2004

Is it possible to test directly General Relativity in the gravitational field of the Moon? (Lorenzo Iorio - 7 February, 2002)
In this paper the possibility of measuring some general relativistic effects in the gravitational field of the Moon via selenodetic missions, with particular emphasis to the future Japanese SELENE mission, is investigated. It turns out that for SELENE's Main Orbiter, at present, the gravitoelectric periselenium shift, which is the largest general relativistic effect, is 1 or 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the experimental sensitivity. The systematic error induced by the mismodelled classical periselenium precession due to the first even zonal harmonic J2 of the Moon's non-spherical gravitational potential is 3 orders of magnitude larger than the general relativistic gravitoelectric precession

ASTRO-F Survey as Input Catalogues for FIRST (Takao Nakagawa - 26 June, 2001)
ASTRO-F is the second Japanese space mission for infrared astronomy and is scheduled to be launched into a sun-synchronous polar orbit by the Japanese M-V rocket in February 2004. ASTRO-F has a cooled 67 cm telescope with two focal plane instruments: one is the Far-Infrared Surveyor (FIS) and the other is the Infrared Camera (IRC). The main purpose of FIS is to perform the all-sky survey with four photometric bands in the wavelength range of 50 - 200 $Î¼$m. The advantages of the FIS survey over the IRAS survey are (1) higher spatial resolution ($30''$ at 50-110 $Î¼$m and $50''$ at 110-200 $Î¼$m) and (2) better sensitivity by one to two orders of magnitude. The IRC will make large-area surveys with its wide field of view ($10' \times 10'$), and will be complementary with the FIRST observations at longer wavelengths.

Log-periodic power law bubbles in Latin-American and Asian markets and correlated anti-bubbles in Western stock markets: An empirical study (Anders Johansen - 19 July, 1999)
Furthermore, three of the bubbles are followed by a log-periodic ``anti-bubble'' previously documented for the decay of the Japanese Nikkei starting in Jan. 1990 and the price of Gold starting in Sept. 1980 thus rendering a qualitative symmetry of bubble and anti-bubble around the date of the peak of the market. A set of secondary western stock market indices (London, Sydney, Auckland, Paris, Madrid, Milan, Zurich) as well as the Hong-Kong stock market are also shown to exhibit well-correlated log-periodic power law anti-bubbles over a period 6-15 months triggered by a rash of crises on emerging markets in the early 1994. As the US market declined by no more than 10% during the beginning of that period and quickly recovered, this suggests that these smaller stock western markets can ``phase lock'' (in a weak sense) not only because of the over-arching influence of Wall Street but also independently of the current trends on Wall Street due to other influences.

MAXI, Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image, is the X-ray observatory on the Japanese experimental module (JEM) Exposed Facility (EF) on the International Space Station (ISS). MAXI is a slit scanning camera which consists of two kinds of X-ray detectors: one is a one-dimensional position-sensitive proportional counter with a total area of $\sim 5000 cm^2$, the Gas Slit Camera (GSC), and the other is an X-ray CCD array with a total area $\sim 200 cm^2$, the Solid-state Slit Camera (SSC). The GSC subtends a field of view with an angular dimension of 1$^\circ\times 180^\circ$ while the SSC subtends a field of view with an angular dimension of 1$^\circ$ times a little less than 180$^\circ$. In the course of one station orbit, MAXI can scan almost the entire sky with a precision of 1$^\circ$ and with an X-ray energy range of 0.5-30 keV. The energy resolution of EM CCD for Mn K$Î±$ has a full-width at half maximum of $\simeq$ 182 eV. Readout noise is $\simeq$ 11 e^- rms.
