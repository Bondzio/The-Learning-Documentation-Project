3D Segmentation with Exponential Logarithmic Loss for Highly Unbalanced Object Sizes (Ken C. L. Wong - 24 September, 2018)
With the introduction of fully convolutional neural networks, deep learning has raised the benchmark for medical image segmentation on both speed and accuracy, and different networks have been proposed for 2D and 3D segmentation with promising results. Nevertheless, most networks only handle relatively small numbers of labels (<10), and there are very limited works on handling highly unbalanced object sizes especially in 3D segmentation. We achieve an average Dice coefficient of 82% on brain segmentation with 20 labels, with the ratio of the smallest to largest object sizes as 0.14%. Less than 100 epochs are required to reach such accuracy, and segmenting a 128x128x128 volume only takes around 0.4 s.

A Strategy of MR Brain Tissue Images' Suggestive Annotation Based on Modified U-Net (Yang Deng - 27 July, 2018)
In addition, medical data labeled is too rare and expensive to obtain extensively, so choosing appropriate unlabeled dataset instead of all the datasets to annotate, which can attain at least same performance, is also very meaningful. To solve the problem above, we design an automatic segmentation method based on U-shaped deep convolutional network and obtain excellent result with average DSC metric of 0.8610, 0.9131, 0.9003 for Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF), Gray Matter (GM) and White Matter (WM) respectively on the well-known IBSR18 dataset.

Aleatoric uncertainty estimation with test-time augmentation for medical image segmentation with convolutional neural networks (Guotai Wang - 20 July, 2018)
Despite the state-of-the-art performance for medical image segmentation, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have rarely provided uncertainty estimations regarding their segmentation outputs, e.g., model (epistemic) and image-based (aleatoric) uncertainties. Experiments with segmentation of fetal brains and brain tumors from 2D and 3D Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) showed that 1) the test-time augmentation-based aleatoric uncertainty provides a better uncertainty estimation than calculating the test-time dropout-based model uncertainty alone and helps to reduce overconfident incorrect predictions, and 2) our test-time augmentation outperforms a single-prediction baseline and dropout-based multiple predictions.

Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks for Glucose Prediction (Kezhi Li - 16 August, 2018)
Deep learning has recently been applied in healthcare and medical research to achieve state-of-the-art results in a range of tasks including disease diagnosis, and patient state prediction among others. In this work, we present a deep learning model that is capable of predicting glucose levels over a 30-minute horizon with leading accuracy for simulated patient cases (RMSE = 9.38$\pm$0.71 [mg/dL] and MARD = 5.50$\pm$0.62\%) and real patient cases (RMSE = 21.13$\pm$1.23 [mg/dL] and MARD = 10.08$\pm$0.83\%). In addition, the model also provides competitive performance in forecasting adverse glycaemic events with minimal time lag both in a simulated patient dataset (MCC$_{hyper}$ = 0.83$\pm$0.05 and MCC$_{hypo}$ = 0.80$\pm$0.10) and in a real patient dataset (MCC$_{hyper}$ = 0.79$\pm$0.04 and MCC$_{hypo}$ = 0.38$\pm$0.10). This approach is evaluated on a dataset of 10 simulated cases generated from the UVa/Padova simulator and a clinical dataset of 5 real cases each containing glucose readings, insulin bolus, and meal (carbohydrate) data. The prediction algorithm is implemented on an Android mobile phone, with an execution time of $6$ms on a phone compared to an execution time of $780$ms on a laptop in Python.

We propose event-level privacy protection, and develop a feature ablation method to protect event-level privacy in electronic medical records.

We find that these sensitive diagnoses can be divided into 3 categories: (1) 5 diseases have fast declining identifiability (AUC below 0.6 with less than 400 features excluded); (2) 7 diseases with progressively declining identifiability (AUC below 0.7 with between 200 and 700 features excluded); and (3) 1 disease with slowly declining identifiability (AUC above 0.7 with 1000 features excluded). The fact that the majority (12 out of 13) of the sensitive diseases fall into the first two categories suggests the potential of the proposed feature ablation method as a solution for event-level record privacy protection.

Commercially deployed systems during the period could compress 4,096 x 4,096 sized images at 12 bpp to 2 bpp using lossless arithmetic coding, and over the years JPEG and JPEG2000 were imbibed reaching upto 0.1 bpp. At high density compression factors of >300x (~0.04 bpp), our approach rivals JPEG and JPEG2000 as evaluated through a Radiologist's visual Turing test.

Accurate Weakly Supervised Deep Lesion Segmentation on CT Scans: Self-Paced 3D Mask Generation from RECIST (Jinzheng Cai - 25 January, 2018)
Volumetric lesion segmentation via medical imaging is a powerful means to precisely assess multiple time-point lesion/tumor changes. Toward this end, we introduce a convolutional neural network based weakly supervised self-paced segmentation (WSSS) method to 1) generate the initial lesion segmentation on the axial RECIST-slice; 2) learn the data distribution on RECIST-slices; 3) adapt to segment the whole volume slice by slice to finally obtain a volumetric segmentation. For the DeepLesion dataset, we report mean Dice coefficients of 93% on RECIST-slices and 76% in 3D lesion volumes. We further validate using a subjective user study, where an experienced radiologist accepted our WSSS-generated lesion segmentation results with a high probability of 92.4%.

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown to be powerful classification tools in tasks that range from check reading to medical diagnosis, reaching close to human perception, and in some cases surpassing it. In fact, the convolutions processed during training (forward and backward propagation included) represent from $60$-$90$\% of global processing time. For the CIFAR-10 dataset, using a CNN with two convolutional layers, and $500$ and $1500$ kernels, respectively, best speedups achieve $3.28\times$ using four CPUs and $2.45\times$ with three GPUs. Modern imaging datasets, larger and more complex than CIFAR-10 will certainly require more than $60$-$90$\% of processing time calculating convolutions, and speedups will tend to increase accordingly.

DECU uses three RGB-D cameras to monitor patient motion in a medical Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The results indicate that deep features allow DECU to match the classification performance of engineered features in BC scenes and increase the accuracy by up to 8% in DO scenes. In addition, the overall pose history summarization tracing accuracy shows an average detection rate of 85% in BC and of 76% in DO scenes. The proposed keyframe estimation algorithm allows DECU to reach an average 78% transition classification accuracy.

Fast and accurate classification of echocardiograms using deep learning (Ali Madani - 26 June, 2017)
Deep learning is a cutting-edge machine-learning technique that has been useful in analyzing medical images but has not yet been widely applied to echocardiography, partly due to the complexity of echocardiograms' multi view, multi modality format. To this end, we anonymized 834,267 transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) images from 267 patients (20 to 96 years, 51 percent female, 26 percent obese) seen between 2000 and 2017 and labeled them according to standard views. We built a multilayer convolutional neural network and used supervised learning to simultaneously classify 15 standard views. Eighty percent of data used was randomly chosen for training and 20 percent reserved for validation and testing on never seen echocardiograms. Using multiple images from each clip, the model classified among 12 video views with 97.8 percent overall test accuracy without overfitting. Even on single low resolution images, test accuracy among 15 views was 91.7 percent versus 70.2 to 83.5 percent for board-certified echocardiographers

A Data-Driven Analysis of the Influence of Care Coordination on Trauma Outcome (You Chen - 26 May, 2017)
DESIGN We applied a spectral co-clustering methodology to simultaneously infer groups of patients and care coordination patterns, in the form of interaction networks of health care professionals, from electronic medical record (EMR) utilization data. The care coordination pattern for each patient group was represented by standard social network characteristics and its relationship with hospital LOS was assessed via a negative binomial regression with a 95% confidence interval. The EMRs were accessed by healthcare professionals from 179 operational areas during 158,467 operational actions. The first patient group exhibited the shortest hospital LOS and was managed by a care coordination pattern that involved the smallest number of operational areas (102 areas, as opposed to 125 and 138 for the other patient groups), but exhibited the largest number of collaborations between operational areas (e.g., an average of 27.1 connections per operational area compared to 22.5 and 23.3 for the other two groups). The hospital LOS for the second and third patient groups was 14 hours (P = 0.024) and 10 hours (P = 0.042) longer than the first patient group, respectively.

Full-reference image quality assessment-based B-mode ultrasound image similarity measure (Kele Xu - 17 January, 2017)
Yet, despite of the remarkable progress that has been made, the medical ultrasound image similarity measurement remains largely unsolved due to a high level of speckle noise contamination. The experiments are conducted on synthetic data and real-ultrasound liver data and the results demonstrate that, with proposed similarity-based tracking re-initialization, the mean error of landmarks tracking can be decreased from 2 mm to about 1.5 mm in the ultrasound liver sequence.

Personalized Donor-Recipient Matching for Organ Transplantation (Jinsung Yoon - 11 November, 2016)
The probability of a successful transplant depends in a very subtle fashion on compatibility between the donor and the recipient but current medical practice is short of domain knowledge regarding the complex nature of recipient-donor compatibility. ConfidentMatch predicts the success of an organ transplant (in terms of the 3 year survival rates) on the basis of clinical and demographic traits of the donor and recipient. Experiments conducted on the UNOS heart transplant dataset show the superiority of the prognostic value of ConfidentMatch to other competing benchmarks; ConfidentMatch can provide predictions of success with 95% confidence for 5,489 patients of a total population of 9,620 patients, which corresponds to 410 more patients than the most competitive benchmark algorithm (DeepBoost).

The effect of changing overlap in a simple image model and clinical experiments on current entropies (Entropy Correlation Coefficient - ECC, MIS and NMI) and the proposed ones (MIT and NMT) showed NMI and NMIT with Tsallis parameter close to 1 as the best options (confidence and accuracy) for CT to MRI and PET to MRI automatic neuroimaging registration.

In this paper, we proposed to find $n$ optimal projections, whereas $n\!<\!180$, in order to increase the expressiveness of Radon barcodes. We show examples for the exhaustive search for the simple case when we attempt to find 4 best projections out of 16 equidistant projections and compare it with the evolutionary approach in order to establish the benefit of the latter when operating on a small population size as in the case of micro-DE. We randomly selected 10 different classes from IRMA dataset (14,400 x-ray images in 58 classes) and further randomly selected 5 images per class for our tests.
