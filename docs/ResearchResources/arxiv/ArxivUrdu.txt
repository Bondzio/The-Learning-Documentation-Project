XNLI: Evaluating Cross-lingual Sentence Representations (Alexis Conneau - 13 September, 2018)
In this work, we construct an evaluation set for XLU by extending the development and test sets of the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference Corpus (MultiNLI) to 15 languages, including low-resource languages such as Swahili and Urdu

Urdu Word Segmentation using Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Haris Bin Zia - 14 June, 2018)
This paper presents a word segmentation system for Urdu which uses a Conditional Random Field sequence modeler with orthographic, linguistic and morphological features. Using a manually annotated corpus, our model achieves F1 score of 0.97 for word boundary identification and 0.85 for sub-word boundary identification tasks

PronouncUR: An Urdu Pronunciation Lexicon Generator (Haris Bin Zia - 5 March, 2018)
In this paper, we present a grapheme-to-phoneme conversion tool for Urdu that generates a pronunciation lexicon in a form suitable for use with speech recognition systems from a list of Urdu words. The tool predicts the pronunciation of words using a LSTM-based model trained on a handcrafted expert lexicon of around 39,000 words and shows an accuracy of 64% upon internal evaluation

Sequence to Sequence Networks for Roman-Urdu to Urdu Transliteration (Mehreen Alam - 8 December, 2017)
We create the first ever parallel corpora of Roman-Urdu to Urdu, create the first ever distributed representation of Roman-Urdu and present the first neural machine translation model that transliterates text from Roman-Urdu to Urdu language. Precisely, our model is able to correctly predict sentences up to length 10 while achieving BLEU score of 48.6 on the test set

An Unsupervised Approach for Mapping between Vector Spaces (Syed Sarfaraz Akhtar - 20 November, 2017)
We initially evaluate our approach via word similarity tasks on a similar language pair - Hindi as source and Urdu as the target language, while we also evaluate our method on French and German as target languages and English as source language. Our approach improves the current state of the art results - by 13% for French and 19% for German. For Urdu, we saw an increment of 16% over our initial baseline score

Handwritten Urdu Character Recognition using 1-Dimensional BLSTM Classifier (Saad Bin Ahmed - 15 May, 2017)
Currently, there is no standard and comprehensive Urdu handwritten dataset available publicly for researchers. The acquired dataset covers commonly used ligatures that were written by 500 writers with their natural handwriting on A4 size paper

Machine Translation Approaches and Survey for Indian Languages (Nadeem Jadoon Khan - 16 January, 2017)
We report the performance of baseline systems translating from Indian languages (Bengali, Guajarati, Hindi, Malayalam, Punjabi, Tamil, Telugu and Urdu) into English with average 10% accurate results for all the language pairs.

A Generic Method for Automatic Ground Truth Generation of Camera-captured Documents (Sheraz Ahmed - 4 May, 2016)
The method is generic, language independent and can be used for generation of labeled documents datasets (both scanned and cameracaptured) in any cursive and non-cursive language, e.g., English, Russian, Arabic, Urdu, etc. The second contribution is a large dataset (called C3Wi) of camera-captured characters and words images, comprising 1 million word images (10 million character images), captured in a real camera-based acquisition. Evaluation results reveal that the existing OCRs, which already get very high accuracies on scanned documents, have limited performance on camera-captured document images; where ABBYY has an accuracy of 75%, Tesseract an accuracy of 50.22%, while the presented character recognition system has an accuracy of 95.10%.

A Modality Lexicon and its use in Automatic Tagging (Kathryn Baker - 17 October, 2014)
In a machine translation application, using the structure-based tagger to annotate English modalities on an English-Urdu training corpus improved the translation quality score for Urdu by 0.3 Bleu points in the face of sparse training data.

Improving Web Page Readability by Plain Language (Walayat Hussain - 8 June, 2011)
In this paper, we propose a plain language for a local language (Urdu) using English alphabets for web pages in Pakistan. We also conducted a questionnaire from 40 different users with a different level of English language fluency in Pakistan to gain the evidence of the practicality of our approach

Automatic Text Area Segmentation in Natural Images (Syed Ali Raza Jafri - 30 January, 2008)
We tested our method on a database of 65 images including English and Urdu text. The method correctly segmented all the text areas in 63 of these images, and in only 4 of these were areas that do not contain text also segmented.

Phrase-Based & Neural Unsupervised Machine Translation (Guillaume Lample - 13 August, 2018)
On low-resource languages like English-Urdu and English-Romanian, our methods achieve even better results than semi-supervised and supervised approaches leveraging the paucity of available bitexts

Automatic text extraction and character segmentation using maximally stable extremal regions (Nitigya Sambyal - 11 August, 2016)
The algorithm is tested along a set of various JPEG, PNG and BMP images over four different character sets; English, Russian, Hindi and Urdu. The algorithm gives good results for English and Russian character set; however character segmentation in Urdu and Hindi language is not much accurate

Roman Urdu Opinion Mining System (RUOMiS) (Misbah Daud - 7 January, 2015)
This research proposes a system which extracts the comments posted in Roman Urdu, translate them, find their polarity and then gives us the rating of the product. This rating will help the native and non-native customers to make buying decision efficiently from the comments posted in Roman Urdu.

Building a reordering system using tree-to-string hierarchical model (Jacob Dlougach - 13 February, 2013)
