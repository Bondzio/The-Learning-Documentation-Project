POIReviewQA: A Semantically Enriched POI Retrieval and Question Answering Dataset (Gengchen Mai - 5 October, 2018)
It consists of 20k questions (e.g."is this restaurant dog friendly?") for 1022 Yelp business types. For each question we sampled 10 reviews, and annotated each sentence in the reviews whether it answers the question and what the corresponding answer is. We build a Lucene-based baseline model, which achieves 77.0% AUC and 48.8% MAP. A sentence embedding-based model achieves 79.2% AUC and 41.8% MAP, indicating that the dataset presents a challenging problem for future research by the GIR community

Transition from Plan Driven to SAFe : Periodic Team Self-Assessment (Mohammad Abdur Razzak - 2 November, 2017)
Context: How to adopt, scale and tailor agile methods depends on several factors such as the size of the organization, business goals, operative model, and needs. Method: As part of a longitudinal study of an SME transitioning to SAFe we ask, to what extent are SAFe practices adopted at the team level? We targeted all team members and administrated a mixed method survey in February, 2017 and in July, 2017 to identify and evaluate the adoption rate of SAFe practices. Results: Initially in Quarter 1, teams were struggling with PI/Release health and Technical health throughout the organization as most of the teams were transitioning from plan-driven to SAFe . But, during the transition period in Quarter 3, we observed discernible improvements in different areas of SAFe practice adoption

Cross-sectoral collaborations between governments, businesses, international organizations, private investors, academia and non-profits are essential for lasting success in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and securing a prosperous future for the health and wellbeing of all people. Our aim is to use data science and innovative technologies to map diverse stakeholders and their initiatives around SDGs and specific health targets - with particular focus on SDG 3 (Good Health & Well Being) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) - to accelerate cross-sector collaborations. Initially, the mapping tool focuses on Geneva, Switzerland as the world center of global health diplomacy with over 80 key stakeholders and influencers present. Building on this pilot, we can later expand beyond only SDG 3 to other SDGs.

Informed by the fitted model, we systematically select and enrich a subset of 105 homogeneous "statistical twins" with additional explanatory variables, unreasonable to collect for \emph{all} hosting providers. These factors together explain a further 77\,\% of the remaining variation, calling into question premature inferences from raw abuse indicators on security efforts of actors, and suggesting the adoption of similar analysis frameworks in all domains where network measurement aims at informing technology policy.

Essentially discounts should not just be treated as short term solutions to attract individual customer, instead, allocating discounts to a small fraction of users (called seed users) may trigger a large cascade in a social network. We propose a simple greedy policy with an approximation ratio of $\frac{1}{2}(1 - 1/e)$ in non-adaptive setting

To Share or Not to Share in Client-Side Encrypted Clouds (Duane Wilson - 19 November, 2014)
With the advent of cloud computing, a number of cloud providers have arisen to provide Storage-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings to both regular consumers and business organizations. Three models exist amongst SaaS providers for protecting the confidentiality data stored in the cloud: 1) no encryption (data is stored in plain text), 2) server-side encryption (data is encrypted once uploaded), and 3) client-side encryption (data is encrypted prior to upload). This paper seeks to identify weaknesses in the third model, as it claims to offer 100% user data confidentiality throughout all data transactions (e.g., upload, download, sharing) through a combination of Network Traffic Analysis, Source Code Decompilation, and Source Code Disassembly. In this capacity, they assume the role of both certificate issuer and certificate authorizer as denoted in a Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) scheme - which gives them the ability to view user data contradicting their claims of 100% data confidentiality

CSHURI - Modified HURI algorithm for Customer Segmentation and Transaction Profitability (Jyothi Pillai - 8 May, 2012)
Association rule mining (ARM) is the process of generating rules based on the correlation between the set of items that the customers purchase.Of late, data mining researchers have improved upon the quality of association rule mining for business development by incorporating factors like value (utility), quantity of items sold (weight) and profit. The advantage of wealth of the customers' needs information and rules aids the retailer in designing his store layout[9]. An algorithm CSHURI, Customer Segmentation using HURI, is proposed, a modified version of HURI [6], finds customers who purchase high profitable rare items and accordingly classify the customers based on some criteria; for example, a retail business may need to identify valuable customers who are major contributors to a company's overall profit. For a potential customer arriving in the store, which customer group one should belong to according to customer needs, what are the preferred functional features or products that the customer focuses on and what kind of offers will satisfy the customer, etc., finds the key in targeting customers to improve sales [9], which forms the base for customer utility mining.

Text Region Extraction from Business Card Images for Mobile Devices (Ayatullah Faruk Mollah - 9 March, 2010)
Designing a Business Card Reader (BCR) for mobile devices is a challenge to the researchers because of huge deformation in acquired images, multiplicity in nature of the business cards and most importantly the computational constraints of the mobile devices. Experiments show that the text extraction accuracy is around 98% for a wide range of resolutions with varying computation time and memory requirements. The optimum performance is achieved for the images of resolution 1024x768 pixels with text extraction accuracy of 98.54% and, space and time requirements as 1.1 MB and 0.16 seconds respectively.

Correlation of Expert and Search Engine Rankings (Michael L. Nelson - 21 October, 2008)
We are interested in a related question: do expert rankings of real-world entities correlate with search engine rankings of corresponding web resources? For example, each year US News & World Report publishes a list of (among others) top 50 graduate business schools. Does their expert ranking correlate with the search engine ranking of the URLs of those business schools? To answer this question we conducted 9 experiments using 8 expert rankings on a range of academic, athletic, financial and popular culture topics. We compared the expert rankings with the rankings in Google, Live Search (formerly MSN) and Yahoo (with list lengths of 10, 25, and 50). In 57 search engine vs. expert comparisons, only 1 strong and 4 moderate correlations were statistically significant. In 42 inter-search engine comparisons, only 2 strong and 4 moderate correlations were statistically significant. The correlations appeared to decrease with the size of the lists: the 3 strong correlations were for lists of 10, the 8 moderate correlations were for lists of 25, and no correlations were found for lists of 50.

Ten-Year Cross-Disciplinary Comparison of the Growth of Open Access and How it Increases Research Citation Impact (C. Hajjem - 15 August, 2006)
We tested 1,307,038 articles published across 12 years (1992-2003) in 10 disciplines (Biology, Psychology, Sociology, Health, Political Science, Economics, Education, Law, Business, Management). A robot trawls the Web for full-texts using reference metadata ISI citation data (signal detectability d'=2.45; bias = 0.52). Percentage OA (relative to total OA + NOA) articles varies from 5%-16% (depending on discipline, year and country) and is slowly climbing annually (correlation r=.76, sample size N=12, probability p < 0.005). Comparing OA and NOA articles in the same journal/year, OA articles have consistently more citations, the advantage varying from 36%-172% by discipline and year. Comparing articles within six citation ranges (0, 1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15, 16+ citations), the annual percentage of OA articles is growing significantly faster than NOA within every citation range (r > .90, N=12, p < .0005) and the effect is greater with the more highly cited articles (r = .98, N=6, p < .005). Causality cannot be determined from these data, but our prior finding of a similar pattern in physics, where percent OA is much higher (and even approaches 100% in some subfields), makes it unlikely that the OA citation advantage is merely or mostly a self-selection bias (for making only one's better articles OA)

Granted that big data science is a new science what are its foundations as compared to conventional topics in Physics, Chemistry or Biology? Or, is it similar to astronomy or nuclear science? What are the technological and engineering implications and how these can be advantageously used to augment business intelligence, for example? Will the industry adopt the changes due to tactical advantages? How can BD success stories be carried over elsewhere? How will BD affect the Computer Science and other curricula? How will BD benefit different segments of our society on a large scale? To answer these, an appreciation of the BD as a science and as a technology is necessary
