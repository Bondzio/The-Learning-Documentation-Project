The Effect of Time Delay on the Average Data Rate and Performance in Networked Control Systems (M. Barforooshan - 4 September, 2018)
The system comprises a discrete-time noisy linear time-invariant (LTI) plant whose single measurement output is mapped into its single control input by a causal, but otherwise arbitrary, coding and control scheme. For the special case of a constant channel delay, we obtain an upper bound by proposing linear source-coding schemes that attain desired performance levels with rates that are at most 1.254 bits per sample greater than the lower bound

Generation of Automatic and Realistic Artificial Profiles (Abigail Paradise - 30 June, 2018)
One of the most effective approaches for detecting malicious activity in OSNs involves the use of social network honeypots - artificial profiles that are deliberately planted within OSNs in order to attract abusers. Evaluation by 70 domain experts confirms the method's ability to generate realistic artificial profiles that are indistinguishable from real profiles, demonstrating that our method can be applied to generate realistic artificial profiles for a wide range of applications.

Optimal Infinite Horizon Decentralized Networked Controllers with Unreliable Communication (Yi Ouyang - 18 June, 2018)
Each local controller directly observes the state of its co-located plant and can inform the remote controller of the plant's state through an unreliable uplink channel. The finite horizon version of this problem was solved in our prior work [2]. Our main results in Theorems 1 and 2 explicitly identify the critical thresholds for the link failure probabilities and the optimal decentralized control strategies when all link failure probabilities are below their thresholds.

Explaining hyperspectral imaging based plant disease identification: 3D CNN and saliency maps (Koushik Nagasubramanian - 23 April, 2018)
Our overarching goal is to develop an accurate and explainable model for plant disease identification using hyperspectral data. Hyperspectral images were captured at 240 different wavelengths in the range of 383 - 1032 nm. Our model has classification accuracy of 95.73\% and an infected class F1 score of 0.87. We identify the most sensitive wavelength as 733 nm using the saliency map visualization. Since the most sensitive wavelength is in the Near Infrared Region(700 - 1000 nm) of the electromagnetic spectrum, which is also the commonly used spectrum region for determining the vegetation health of the plant, we were more confident in the predictions using our model.

Improved Part Segmentation Performance by Optimising Realism of Synthetic Images using Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (Ruud Barth - 16 March, 2018)
We first hypothesise and confirm that plant part image features such as color and texture become more similar to the empirical domain after translation of the synthetic images.Results confirm this with an improved mean color distribution correlation with the empirical data prior of 0.62 and post translation of 0.90. In Part II, 7 experiments were performed using convolutional neural networks with different combinations of synthetic, synthetic translated to empirical and empirical images. First a maximum intersection-over-union performance was achieved of 0.52 when bootstrapping with translated images and fine-tuning with empirical images; an 8% increase compared to only using synthetic images. Second, training without any empirical fine-tuning resulted in an average IOU of 0.31; a 55% performance increase over previous methods that only used synthetic images.

Treelogy: A Novel Tree Classifier Utilizing Deep and Hand-crafted Representations (Ä°lke ÃuÄu - 28 January, 2017)
We propose a novel tree classification system called Treelogy, that fuses deep representations with hand-crafted features obtained from leaf images to perform leaf-based plant classification. Key to this system are segmentation of the leaf from an untextured background, using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for learning deep representations, extracting hand-crafted features with a number of image processing techniques, training a linear SVM with feature vectors, merging SVM and CNN results, and identifying the species from a dataset of 57 trees. Furthermore, our novel dataset comprised of 5408 leaf images is also made public for use of other researchers.

Stitching Inter-Domain Paths over IXPs (Vasileios Kotronis - 8 November, 2016)
Modern Internet applications, from HD video-conferencing to health monitoring and remote control of power-plants, pose stringent demands on network latency, bandwidth and availability. To evaluate the potential of this approach, we first map the global substrate of inter-IXP pathlets that IXP members could offer, based on measurements for 229 IXPs worldwide. Up to 91 % of the total IPv4 address space can be served by such inter-domain routing brokers when working in concert with just a handful of large IXPs and their associated ISP members. Second, path diversity on the inter-IXP graph increases by up to 29 times, as compared to current BGP valley-free routing

An example of a CCQSP statement is go to A through B within 30 minutes, with less than 0.001% probability of failure."  We then develop the p-Sulu Planner, which can tractably solve a CCQSP planning problem. In order to enable CCQSP planning, we develop the following two capabilities in this paper: 1) risk-sensitive planning with risk bounds, and 2) goal-directed planning in a continuous domain with temporal constraints

Authentication of cyber-physical systems under learning-based attacks (Mohammad Javad Khojasteh - 17 September, 2018)
A class of two-phase attacks are considered: during an exploration phase, the attacker passively eavesdrops and learns the plant dynamics, followed by an exploitation phase, during which the attacker hijacks the input to the plant and replaces the input to the controller with a carefully crafted fictitious sensor reading with the aim of destabilizing the plant without being detected by the controller. For an authentication test that examines the variance over a time window, tools from information theory and statistics are utilized to derive bounds on the detection and deception probabilities with and without a watermark signal, when the attacker uses an arbitrary learning algorithm to estimate the open-loop gain of the plant.

On the Control of Asynchronous Automata (Hugo Gimbert - 4 August, 2017)
The decidability of the distributed version of the Ramadge and Wonham controller synthesis problem,where both the plant and the controllers are modeled as asynchronous automataand the controllers have causal memoryis a challenging open problem.There exist three classes of plants for which the existence of a correct controller with causal memory has been shown decidable: when the dependency graph of actions is series-parallel, when the processes are connectedly communicating and when the dependency graph of processes is a tree. We design a class of plants, called decomposable games, with a decidable controller synthesis problem.This provides a unified proof of the three existing decidability results as well as new examples of decidable plants.

Queuing models for abstracting interactions in Bacterial communities (NicolÃ² Michelusi - 10 January, 2016)
Microbial communities play a significant role in bioremediation,plant growth,human and animal digestion,global elemental cycles including the carbon-cycle,and water treatment.They are also posed to be the engines of renewable energy via microbial fuel cells which can reverse the process of electrosynthesis.Microbial communication regulates many virulence mechanisms used by bacteria.Thus,it is of fundamental importance to understand interactions in microbial communities and to develop predictive tools that help control them,in order to aid the design of systems exploiting bacterial capabilities.This position paper explores how abstractions from communications,networking and information theory can play a role in understanding and modeling bacterial interactions.In particular,two forms of interactions in bacterial systems will be examined:electron transfer and quorum sensing.While the diffusion of chemical signals has been heavily studied,electron transfer occurring in living cells and its role in cell-cell interaction is less understood.Recent experimental observations open up new frontiers in the design of microbial systems based on electron transfer,which may coexist with the more well-known interaction strategies based on molecular diffusion.In quorum sensing,the concentration of certain signature chemical compounds emitted by the bacteria is used to estimate the bacterial population size,so as to activate collective behaviors.In this position paper,queuing models for electron transfer are summarized and adapted to provide new models for quorum sensing.These models are stochastic,and thus capture the inherent randomness exhibited by cell colonies in nature.It is shown that queuing models allow the characterization of the state of a single cell as a function of interactions with other cells and the environment,while being amenable to complexity reduction.
