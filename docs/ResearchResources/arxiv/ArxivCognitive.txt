In this paper, a 3-class intuitive BCI is presented which enables users to directly answer yes or no questions by covertly rehearsing the word 'yes' or 'no' for 15 s. Twelve participants each completed one offline block and six online blocks over the course of 2 sessions. By the final online block, 9 out of 12 participants were performing above chance (p<0.001), with a 3-class accuracy of 83.8+9.4%.

Four-Dimensional Usability Investigation of Image CAPTCHA (Junnan Yu - 4 December, 2016)
The cognitive processes revealed by eye-tracking indicate that the distribution of eye gaze is equally assigned to each candidate image and irrelevant to the variation of image contents. In addition, the gazing plot suggests that more than 70% of the participants inspected CAPTCHA images row-by-row, which is more efficient than scanning randomly. Those four-dimensional evaluations essentially suggest that square and horizontal rectangle are the preferred layout; image quantities may not exceed 16 while the image color is insignificant. Meanwhile, the image size and tilting angle are suggested to be larger than 55 pixels x 55 pixels and within -45~45 degrees, respectively

On the other hand, the observation resistant property of cognitive schemes provides an extra layer of protection for behavioural biometrics; an attacker is unsure if a failed impersonation is due to a biometric failure or a wrong response to the challenge. To provide security close to a 4-digit PIN---one in 10,000 chance to impersonate---we only need two challenge-response rounds, which can be completed in less than 38 seconds on average (as estimated in our user study), with the advantage that unlike PINs or passwords, the scheme is secure under observation.

Deep Models for Engagement Assessment With Scarce Label Information (Feng Li - 21 October, 2016)
It is usually challenging and expensive to label cognitive state data, and traditional computational models trained with limited label information for engagement assessment do not perform well because of overfitting. We recruited 15 pilots to conduct a 4-h flight simulation from Seattle to Chicago and recorded their electroencephalograph (EEG) signals during the simulation. Experts carefully examined the EEG signals and labeled 20 min of the EEG data for each pilot. The deep models were pretrained by the unlabeled data and were fine-tuned by a different proportion of the labeled data (top 1%, 3%, 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20%) to learn new representations for engagement assessment. Experimental results show that the representations learned by the deep models yielded better accuracies for the six scenarios (77.09%, 80.45%, 83.32%, 85.74%, 85.78%, and 86.52%), based on different proportions of the labeled data for training, as compared with the corresponding accuracies (62.73%, 67.19%, 73.38%, 79.18%, 81.47%, and 84.92%) achieved by the original EEG features

Numerical results show that: 1) the proposed scheme can outperform the traditional ones by properly selecting the secondary user's parameters of different transmission schemes according to the relative positions of the nodes; 2) the derived capacity upper bound is close to the secondary user's achievable rate within 0.3 bits/channel use, especially when the secondary transmitter/receiver is far/close enough to the primary receiver/transmitter, respectively

On the Limits of Predictability in Real-World Radio Spectrum State Dynamics: From Entropy Theory to 5G Spectrum Sharing (Guoru Ding - 23 May, 2015)
A range of applications in cognitive radio networks, from adaptive spectrum sensing to predictive spectrum mobility and dynamic spectrum access, depend on our ability to foresee the state evolution of radio spectrum, raising a fundamental question: To what degree is radio spectrum state (RSS) predictable? In this paper, we explore the fundamental limits of predictability in RSS dynamics by studying the RSS evolution patterns in spectrum bands of several popular services, including TV bands, ISM bands, and Cellular bands, etc. Despite the apparent randomness, we find a remarkable predictability, as large as 90%, in the real-world RSS dynamics over a number of spectrum bands for all popular services

Low Delay MAC Scheduling for Frequency-agile Multi-radio Wireless Networks (Avhishek Chatterjee - 17 February, 2013)
The challenge in designing a low-complexity distributed MAC, that achieves low delay, is posed by two additional dimensions of cognitive radio networks: interference graphs and data rates that are frequency-band dependent, and explosion in number of feasible schedules due to large number of available frequency-bands. Due to a recent impossibility result, optimal delay-scaling could only be achieved with some amount of throughput loss [30]. Extensive simulations using OMNeT++ network simulator shows that, compared to a multi-band extension of a state-of-art CSMA algorithm (namely, Q-CSMA), our asynchronous algorithm achieves a 2.5x? reduction in delay while achieving at least 85% of the maximum achievable throughput

Finite Horizon Adaptive Optimal Distributed Power Allocation for Enhanced Cognitive Radio Network in the Presence of Channel Uncertainties (Hao Xu - 6 February, 2013)
Therefore, a novel finite horizon adaptive optimal distributed power allocation scheme is proposed by incorporating the effect of channel uncertainties for enhanced cognitive radio network in the presence of wireless channel uncertainties under two cases. In Case 1, proposed scheme can force the Signal-to-interference (SIR) of the secondary users to converge to a higher target value for increasing network throughput when primary users' are not communicating within finite horizon. Once primary users are activated as in the Case 2, proposed scheme can not only force the SIR of primary users to converge to a higher target SIR, but also force the SIR of secondary users to converge to a lower value for regulating their interference to Pus during finite time period

Power Control and Multiuser Diversity for the Distributed Cognitive Uplink (Ehsan Nekouei - 6 April, 2013)
This paper studies optimum power control and sum-rate scaling laws for the distributed cognitive uplink. When transmissions of secondary users are limited by both transmission and interference power constraints, it is shown that the secondary network sum-rate scales according to $\frac{1}{\e{}n_h}\log\logp{N}$, where $n_h$ is a parameter obtained from the distribution of direct channel power gains. For the case of transmissions limited only by interference constraints, on the other hand, the secondary network sum-rate scales according to $\frac{1}{\e{}Î³_g}\logp{N}$, where $Î³_g$ is a parameter obtained from the distribution of interference channel power gains. These results indicate that the distributed cognitive uplink is able to achieve throughput scaling behavior similar to that of the centralized cognitive uplink up to a pre-log multiplier $\frac{1}{\e{}}$, whilst primary's quality-of-service requirements are met. The factor $\frac{1}{\e{}}$ can be interpreted as the cost of distributed implementation of the cognitive uplink.

The GCCIC is an interference channel with unilateral source cooperation that better models practical cognitive radio networks than the commonly used model which assumes that one source has perfect non-causal knowledge of the other source's message. In particular, the capacity is determined (a) to within 2 bits for the fully connected GCCIC when, roughly speaking, the interference is not weak at both receivers, (b) to within 2 bits for the Z-channel, i.e., when there is no interference from the primary user, and (c) to within 2 bits for the S-channel, i.e., when there is no interference from the secondary user

The DoF of the K-user Interference Channel with a Cognitive Relay (Anas Chaaban - 2 July, 2012)
It was shown recently that the 2-user interference channel with a cognitive relay (IC-CR) has full degrees of freedom (DoF) almost surely, that is, 2 DoF. The $K$-user IC-CR is shown to have $2K/3$ DoF if $K>2$ for the when the channel is time varying, achievable using interference alignment. Thus, while the basic $K$-user IC with time varying channel coefficients has 1/2 DoF per user for all $K$, the $K$-user IC-CR with varying channels has 1 DoF per user if K=2 and 2/3 DoF per user if $K>2$

Bounds and Capacity Theorems for Cognitive Interference Channels with State (Ruchen Duan Yingbin Liang - 8 July, 2012)
A class of cognitive interference channel with state is investigated, in which two transmitters (transmitters 1 and 2) communicate with two receivers (receivers 1 and 2) over an interference channel. The two transmitters jointly transmit a common message to the two receivers, and transmitter 2 also sends a separate message to receiver 2. The scenario in which the state sequence is noncausally known only at transmitter 2 is first studied. The Gaussian channels are further studied, which are partitioned into two cases based on how the interference compares with the signal at receiver 1. The second scenario in which the state sequence is noncausally known at both transmitter 2 and receiver 2 is further studied. It is also shown that this capacity is achieved by certain Gaussian channels with state noncausally known only at transmitter 2.

The thermodynamic cost of fast thought (Alexandre de Castro - 26 January, 2013)
In this context, in his latest book, titled Thinking Fast and Slow [8], Kahneman [7,8] provides further theoretical interpretation by differentiating the two assumed systems of the cognitive functioning of the human mind. He calls them intuition (system 1) determined to be an associative (automatic, fast and perceptual) machine, and reasoning (system 2) required to be voluntary and to operate logical- deductively. Specifically, a thought experiment is performed utilizing the mind of a dual-natured creature known as Maxwell's demon: a tiny "man-machine" solely equipped with the characteristics of system 1, which prevents it from reasoning. This result indicates that when the system 2 is shut down, both an intelligent being, as well as a binary machine, incur the same energy cost per unit of information processed, which mathematically proves the computational attribute of the system 1, as Kahneman [7,8] theorized

Numerical results also illustrate that with 6 bits of feedback, the derived algorithms provide SU outage performance very close to that with full CSI at the SU-TX.

Large Overlaid Cognitive Radio Networks: From Throughput Scaling to Asymptotic Multiplexing Gain (Armin Banaei - 3 June, 2013)

We study the problem in two distinct regimes, namely Î²>1 and 0<Î²<1. With this metric, we clearly demonstrate that spectrum sensing can substantially improve primary network performance when Î²>1. On the contrary, spectrum sensing turns out to be unnecessary when Î²<1 and setting the secondary network's ALOHA parameter appropriately can substantially improve primary network performance.
