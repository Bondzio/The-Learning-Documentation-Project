A POS Tagger for Code Mixed Indian Social Media Text - ICON-2016 NLP Tools Contest Entry from Surukam (Sree Harsha Ramesh - 31 December, 2016)
This paper describes the POS tagger built at Surukam to predict the coarse-grained and fine-grained POS tags for three language pairs - Bengali-English, Telugu-English and Hindi-English, with the text spanning three popular social media platforms - Facebook, WhatsApp and Twitter. Our submissions in the constrained environment,i.e., without making any use of monolingual POS taggers or the like, obtained an overall average F1-score of 76.45%, which is comparable to the 2015 winning score of 76.79%.

Gaussian Mixture Model for Handwritten Script Identification (Mallikarjun Hangarge - 11 March, 2013)
This paper presents a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to identify the script of handwritten words of Roman, Devanagari, Kannada and Telugu scripts. A dataset of 400 images out of 800 (200 of each script) are used for training GMM and the remaining is for testing. An exhaustive experimentation is carried out at bi-script, tri-script and multi-script level and achieved script identification accuracies in percentage as 98.7, 98.16 and 96.91 respectively.

Discrimination of English to other Indian languages (Kannada and Hindi) for OCR system (Ankit Kumar - 10 May, 2012)
For example in Andhra Pradesh, a state in India, the document may contain text words in English and Telugu script. We analysed 700 different words of Kannada, English and Hindi in order to extract the discrimination features and for the development of knowledge base. The proposed system is tested on 100 different document images containing more than 1000 text words of each script and a classification rate of 98.25%, 99.25% and 98.87% is achieved for Kannada, English and Hindi respectively.

Gender Based Emotion Recognition System for Telugu Rural Dialects Using Hidden Markov Models (Prasad Reddy P. V. G. D - 23 June, 2010)
Emotional Speech Database from Telugu Rural Dialects of Andhra Pradesh (TRDAP) was designed using several speaker's voices comprising the emotional states. The accuracy of recognizing five different emotions for both genders of classification is 80% for anger-emotion which is achieved by using the best combination of 39-dimensioanl feature vector for every frame (13 MFCCs, 13 Delta Coefficients and 13 Acceleration Coefficients) and a classifier using HMM
