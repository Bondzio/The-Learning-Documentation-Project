Leveraging local network communities to predict academic performance (David Burstein - 10 October, 2018)
Consequently, we propose novel predictors that treat academic success as a contagion by identifying a student's learning community, consisting of the peers that are most likely to influence a student's performance in a course. We evaluate the importance of these learning communities by predicting academic outcomes in an introductory college statistics course with 103 students. In particular, we observe that by including these learning community predictors, the resulting model is 68 times more likely to be the correct model than the current state-of-the-art centrality network models in the literature.

DYVERSE: DYnamic VERtical Scaling in Multi-tenant Edge Environments (Nan Wang - 19 September, 2018)
To enable dynamic vertical scaling, one static and three dynamic priority management approaches that are workload-aware, community-aware and system-aware, respectively are proposed. The merits of DYVERSE is that there is only a sub-second overhead per Edge server when 32 Edge servers are deployed on a single Edge node. When compared to executing applications on the Edge servers without dynamic vertical scaling, static priorities and dynamic priorities reduce SLO violation rates of requests by up to 4% and 12% for the online game, respectively, and in both cases 6% for the face detection workload

A scalable parallel finite element framework for growing geometries. Application to metal additive manufacturing (Eric Neiva - 8 October, 2018)
However, efficiency, without loss of accuracy, has rarely been the focus in the numerical community. After verification against a 3D benchmark, a strong scaling analysis is carried out for a simulation of 48 layers printed in a cuboid. The cuboid is adaptively meshed to model a layer-by-layer metal deposition process and the average global problem size amounts to 10.3 million unknowns. An unprecedented scalability for problems with growing domains is achieved, with the capability of simulating the printing and recoat of a single layer in 8 seconds average on 3,072 processors

GI-OHMS: Graphical Inference to Detect Overlapping Communities (Nasheen Nur - 2 October, 2018)
The novelty of our approach is in transforming the complex and dense network of interest into an observed-hidden merged seeded(OHMS) network, which preserves the important community properties of the network. The superiority of our approach lies in two main observations: 1) The extracted OHMS network excludes many weaker connections, thus leading to a higher accuracy of inference 2) The graphical inference step operates on a smaller network, thus having much lower execution time

Diagnostics in Semantic Segmentation (Vladimir Nekrasov - 26 September, 2018)
Over the past years, computer vision community has contributed to enormous progress in semantic image segmentation, a per-pixel classification task, crucial for dense scene understanding and rapidly becoming vital in lots of real-world applications, including driverless cars and medical imaging. Most recent models are now reaching previously unthinkable numbers (e.g., 89% mean iou on PASCAL VOC, 83% on CityScapes), and, while intersection-over-union and a range of other metrics provide the general picture of model performance, in this paper we aim to extend them into other meaningful and important for applications characteristics, answering such questions as 'how accurate the model segmentation is on small objects in the general scene?', or 'what are the sources of uncertainty that cause the model to make an erroneous prediction?'

SCC: Automatic Classification of Code Snippets (Kamel Alreshedy - 21 September, 2018)
Determining the programming language of a source code file has been considered in the research community; it has been shown that Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms can be effective in identifying the programming language of source code files. In this paper, we describe Source Code Classification (SCC), a classifier that can identify the programming language of code snippets written in 21 different programming languages. It is shown to achieve an accuracy of 75% which is higher than that with Programming Languages Identification (PLI a proprietary online classifier of snippets) whose accuracy is only 55.5%. The average score for precision, recall and the F1 score with the proposed tool are 0.76, 0.75 and 0.75, respectively. In addition, it can distinguish between code snippets from a family of programming languages such as C, C++ and C#, and can also identify the programming language version such as C# 3.0, C# 4.0 and C# 5.0.

Deep-learning models improve on community-level diagnosis for common congenital heart disease lesions (Rima Arnaout - 18 September, 2018)
In practice, however, the fetal diagnosis rate for these lesions is only 30-50 percent in community settings. Using 685 retrospectively collected echocardiograms from fetuses 18-24 weeks of gestational age from 2000-2018, we trained convolutional and fully-convolutional deep learning models in a supervised manner to (i) identify the five canonical screening views of the fetal heart and (ii) segment cardiac structures to calculate fetal cardiac biometrics. In a holdout test set of images, F-score for identification of the five most important fetal cardiac views was 0.95. TOF reached an overall sensitivity of 75% and a specificity of 76%, while normal vs. HLHS reached a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 90%, both well above average diagnostic rates for these lesions

Approximate Convex Intersection Detection with Applications to Width and Minkowski Sums (Sunil Arya - 2 July, 2018)
Approximation problems involving a single convex body in $d$-dimensional space have received a great deal of attention in the computational geometry community. In contrast, works involving multiple convex bodies are generally limited to dimensions $d \leq 3$ and/or do not consider approximation. Given an approximation parameter $\varepsilon > 0$, we show how to independently preprocess two polytopes $A,B$ into data structures of size $O(1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2})$ such that we can answer in polylogarithmic time whether $A$ and $B$ intersect approximately. Next, we show how to $\varepsilon$-approximate the Minkowski sum of two given polytopes defined as the intersection of $n$ halfspaces in $O(n \log(1/\varepsilon) + 1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2 + Î±})$ time, for any constant $Î±> 0$. We show how to $\varepsilon$-approximate the width of a set of $n$ points in $O(n \log(1/\varepsilon) + 1/\varepsilon^{(d-1)/2 + Î±})$ time, for any constant $Î±> 0$, a major improvement over the previous bound of roughly $O(n + 1/\varepsilon^{d-1})$ time.

Oh, What a Fragile Web We Weave: Third-party Service Dependencies In Modern Webservices and Implications (Aqsa Kashaf - 21 June, 2018)
The recent October 2016 DDoS attack on Dyn served as a wakeup call to the security community as many popular and independent webservices (e.g., Twitter, Spotify) were impacted. Our key findings are: (1) 73.14% of the top 100,000 popular services are vulnerable to reduction in availabil- ity due to potential attacks on third-party DNS, CDN, CA services that they exclusively rely on; (2) the use of third-party services is concentrated, so that if the top-10 providers of CDN, DNS and OCSP services go down, they can potentially impact 25%-46% of the top 100K most popular web services; (3) transitive depen- dencies significantly increase the set of webservices that exclusively depend on popular CDN and DNS service providers, in some cases by ten times (4) targeting even less popular webservices can potentially cause signifi- cant collateral damage, affecting upto 20% of the top- 100K webservices due to their shared dependencies

The Web of False Information: Rumors, Fake News, Hoaxes, Clickbait, and Various Other Shenanigans (Savvas Zannettou - 1 October, 2018)
Evidently, the problem of false information on the Web is a crucial one, and needs increased public awareness, as well as immediate attention from law enforcement agencies, public institutions, and in particular, the research community. We report a comprehensive overview of existing research on the false information ecosystem by identifying several lines of work: 1) how the public perceives false information; 2) understanding the propagation of false information; 3) detecting and containing false information on the Web; and 4) false information on the political stage. In this work, we pay particular attention to political false information as: 1) it can have dire consequences to the community (e.g., when election results are mutated) and 2) previous work show that this type of false information propagates faster and further when compared to other types of false information

We tested our solution on the KITTI benchmark with a Velodyne HDL64 and ranked among the best methods (against mono, stereo and LiDAR methods) with a global drift of only 0.69%.

Identity recognition from ear images is an active field of research within the biometric community. We explore different strategies towards model training with limited amounts of training data and show that by selecting an appropriate model architecture, using aggressive data augmentation and selective learning on existing (pre-trained) models, we are able to learn an effective CNN-based model using a little more than 1300 training images. With our model we are able to improve on the rank one recognition rate of the previous state-of-the-art by more than 25% on a challenging dataset of ear images captured from the web (a.k.a

Supervised and Extended Restart in Random Walks for Ranking and Link Prediction in Networks (Woojeong Jin - 18 October, 2017)
Given a real-world graph, how can we measure relevance scores for ranking and link prediction? Random walk with restart (RWR) provides an excellent measure for this and has been applied to various applications such as friend recommendation, community detection, anomaly detection, etc. However, RWR suffers from two problems: 1) using the same restart probability for all the nodes limits the expressiveness of random walk, and 2) the restart probability needs to be manually chosen for each application without theoretical justification. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method provides the best performance for ranking and link prediction tasks, improving the MAP (Mean Average Precision) by up to 15.8% on the best competitor.

Weak Memory Models with Matching Axiomatic and Operational Definitions (Sizhuo Zhang - 11 October, 2017)
In response to these complexities, there has been somewhat of a recent trend in the (general-purpose) architecture community to limit new memory models to being (multicopy) atomic: where store values can be read by the issuing processor before being advertised to other processors. TSO is the most notable example, used in the past by IBM 370 and SPARC-TSO, and currently used in x86. Recently (in March 2017) ARM has also switched to a multicopy atomic memory model, and the new RISC-V ISA and recent academic proposals such as WMM are pushing to do the same.

TPA: Fast, Scalable, and Accurate Method for Approximate Random Walk with Restart on Billion Scale Graphs (Minji Yoon - 3 December, 2017)
Given a large graph, how can we determine similarity between nodes in a fast and accurate way? Random walk with restart (RWR) is a popular measure for this purpose and has been exploited in numerous data mining applications including ranking, anomaly detection, link prediction, and community detection. TPA exploits two important properties in RWR: 1) nodes close to a seed node are likely to be revisited in following steps due to block-wise structure of many real-world graphs, and 2) RWR scores of nodes which reside far from the seed node are proportional to their PageRank scores. Through extensive experiments, we show that TPA requires up to 3.5x less time with up to 40x less memory space than other state-of-the-art methods for the preprocessing phase. In the online phase, TPA computes approximate RWR up to 30x faster than existing methods while maintaining high accuracy.

Social Centrality using Network Hierarchy and Community Structure (Rakhi Saxena - 23 June, 2018)
The theory of social capital asserts that an actor's importance is derived from his position in network hierarchy as well as from the potential to mobilize resources through intra-community (bonding) and inter-community (bridging) ties. Our measure accounts for - i) an individual's propensity to socialize, and ii) his connections within and outside the community

Immunization of networks with non-overlapping community structure (Zakariya Ghalmane - 14 June, 2018)

Experimental results show that the proposed strategies are more effective than classical deterministic alternatives that are agnostic of the community structure
