Visually-aware Collaborative Food Recommendation (Xiaoyan Gao - 11 October, 2018)
In this work, we formulate the food recommendation problem as predicting user preference on recipes based on three key factors that determine a user's choice on food, namely, 1) the user's (and other users') history; 2) the ingredients of a recipe; and 3) the descriptive image of a recipe. To address this challenging problem, we develop a dedicated neural network-based solution \emph{Hierarchical Attention based Food Recommendation} (HAFR) which is capable of: 1) capturing the collaborative filtering effect like what similar users tend to eat; 2) inferring a user's preference at the ingredient level; and 3) learning user preference from the recipe's visual image. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms several competing recommender solutions like Factorization Machine and Visual Bayesian Personalized Ranking with an average improvement of 12\%, offering promising results in predicting user preference on food.

NSGA-NET: A Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm for Neural Architecture Search (Zhichao Lu - 8 October, 2018)
NSGA-Net is a population-based search algorithm that explores a space of potential neural network architectures in three steps, namely, a population initialization step that is based on prior-knowledge from hand-crafted architectures, an exploration step comprising crossover and mutation of architectures and finally an exploitation step that applies the entire history of evaluated neural architectures in the form of a Bayesian Network prior. NSGA-Net obtains networks that achieve 3.72% (at 4.5 million FLOP) error on CIFAR-10 classification and 8.64% (at 26.6 million FLOP) error on the CMU-Car alignment task

A Practical Approach to Insertion with Variable Socket Position Using Deep Reinforcement Learning (Mel Vecerik - 8 October, 2018)
Within the learning community there is a long history of insertion research, but existing approaches are typically either too sample-inefficient to run on real robots, or assume access to high-level object features, e.g. Our results show that these tasks can be solved reliably on the real robot in less than 10 minutes of interaction time, and that the resulting policies are robust to variance in the socket position and orientation.

Dropout is a special case of the stochastic delta rule: faster and more accurate deep learning (Noah Frazier-Logue - 10 August, 2018)
Both parameters are updated according to prediction error, thus implementing weight noise injections that reflect a local history of prediction error and efficient model averaging. Tests on standard benchmarks (CIFAR) using a modified version of DenseNet shows the SDR outperforms standard dropout in error by over 50% and in loss by over 50%. Furthermore, the SDR implementation converges on a solution much faster, reaching a training error of 5 in just 15 epochs with DenseNet-40 compared to standard DenseNet-40's 94 epochs.

Reassembling the English novel, 1789-1919 (Allen Riddell - 1 August, 2018)
The following are representative: How many writers made careers as novelists, Are there unacknowledged precursors or forgotten rivals to canonical authors, To what extent is a writer's critical or commercial success predictable from their social origins? In the last decade library digitization and the development of machine-readable datasets have improved the prospects for data-intensive literary history. This paper offers two analyses of bibliographic data concerning novels published in the British Isles after 1789. First, we estimate yearly rates of new novel publication between 1789 and 1919. Second, using titles of novels appearing between 1800 and 1829, we resolve a dispute concerning occupational gender segregation in novel subgenres. We show that the remarkable growth in the number of men novelists after 1815 was not concentrated in particular subgenres.

Assessment of electrical and infrastructure recovery in Puerto Rico following hurricane Maria using a multisource time series of satellite imagery (Jacob Shermeyer - 16 July, 2018)
Total monetary damages are estimated to be ~92 billion USD, the third most costly tropical cyclone in US history. The response to this damage has been tempered and slow moving, with recent estimates placing 45% of the population without power three months after the storm. Based upon our approach we can identify and evaluate: 1) the recovery of electrical power compared to pre-storm levels, 2) the location of potentially damaged infrastructure that has yet to recover from the storm, and 3) the number of persons without power over time. As of May 31, 2018, declined levels of observed brightness across the island indicate that 13.9% +/- ~5.6% of persons still lack power and/or that 13.2% +/- ~5.3% of infrastructure has been lost. In comparison, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority states that less than 1% of their customers still are without power.

A third strike against perfect phylogeny (Leo van Iersel - 19 April, 2018)
Perfect phylogenies are fundamental in the study of evolutionary trees because they capture the situation when each evolutionary trait emerges only once in history; if such events are believed to be rare, then by Occam's Razor such parsimonious trees are preferable as a hypothesis of evolution. A classical result states that 2-state characters permit a perfect phylogeny precisely if each subset of 2 characters permits one. In particular, we show that for any constant $t$, there exists a set $C$ of $8$-state characters such that $C$ has no perfect phylogeny, but there exists a perfect phylogeny for every subset of $t$ characters

On the Construction of Quasi-Binary and Quasi-Orthogonal Matrices over Finite Fields (Danilo Gligoroski - 20 January, 2018)
Orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal matrices have a long history of use in digital image processing, digital and wireless communications, cryptography and many other areas of computer science and coding theory. We call the matrices quasi-binary due to the fact that matrices have only two elements $a, b \in \mathbb{F}_q$, but those elements are not $0$ and $1$. We give a simple relation between the values $a, b, c$ and $d$ for any finite field and especially for finite fields with characteristic 2

Experiments shows that PoseNet allows us to improve the accuracy of CNN based sequence-to-sequence learning significantly, achieving around 33-36 BLEU scores on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, and around 44-46 BLEU scores on the English-to-French translation task.

Progress in science has advanced the development of human society across history, with dramatic revolutions shaped by information theory, genetic cloning, and artificial intelligence, among the many scientific achievements produced in the 20th century. In this work, we study the evolution of scientific development over the past century by presenting an anatomy of 89 million digitalized papers published between 1900 and 2015.

We survey the unfinished history of decreasing the exponent towards its information lower bound 2, recall some important techniques discovered in this process and linked to other fields of computing, reveal sample surprising applications to fast computation of the inner products of two vectors and summation of integers, and discuss the curse of recursion, which separates the progress in fast MM into its most acclaimed and purely theoretical part and into valuable acceleration of MM of feasible sizes

Your Processor Leaks Information - and There's Nothing You Can Do About It (Qian Ge - 14 September, 2017)
Any microarchitectural state that depends on execution history and affects the rate of progress of later executions potentially establishes a timing channel, unless explicit steps are taken to close it. We measure the capacities of channels based on these microarchitectural features on several generations of processors across the two mainstream ISAs, x86 and ARM, and investigate the effectiveness of the flushing mechanisms provided by the respective ISA.We find that in all processors we studied, at least one significant channel remains

Inferring Fine-grained Control Flow Inside SGX Enclaves with Branch Shadowing (Sangho Lee - 1 June, 2017)
The root cause of this attack is that Intel SGX does not clear the branch history when switching from enclave mode to non-enclave mode, leaving the fine-grained traces to the outside world through a branch-prediction side channel. However, exploiting the channel is not so straightforward in practice because 1) measuring branch prediction/misprediction penalties based on timing is too inaccurate to distinguish fine-grained control-flow changes and 2) it requires sophisticated control over the enclave execution to force its execution to the interesting code blocks. To overcome these challenges, we developed two novel exploitation techniques: 1) Intel PT- and LBR-based history-inferring techniques and 2) APIC-based technique to control the execution of enclave programs in a fine-grained manner

A Methodology for Customizing Clinical Tests for Esophageal Cancer based on Patient Preferences (Asis Roy - 5 October, 2016)
For many patients, we can predict non-existence of disease with 100% certainty, just using demographics, lifestyle, and medical history information. The key idea is to design classifiers with 100% false normal rates, possibly at the cost higher false abnormals. We test our methodology with EHRs collected for more than 3000 patients, as a part of project carried out by a reputed hospital in Mumbai, India. Kernel SVM and kernel LR with a polynomial kernel of degree 3, yields an accuracy of 99.8% and sensitivity 100%, without the MP features, i.e. We compute the test sets corresponding to the lowest false abnormals for each criterion described above, using exhaustive enumeration of 15 clinical tests

Character-Level Language Modeling with Hierarchical Recurrent Neural Networks (Kyuyeon Hwang - 2 February, 2017)
However, their performance is generally much worse than the word-level language models (WLMs), since CLMs need to consider longer history of tokens to properly predict the next one. Our CLM models show better perplexity than Kneser-Ney (KN) 5-gram WLMs on the One Billion Word Benchmark with only 2% of parameters. Also, we present real-time character-level end-to-end speech recognition examples on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus, where replacing traditional mono-clock RNN CLMs with the proposed models results in better recognition accuracies even though the number of parameters are reduced to 30%.

Open Problem: Best Arm Identification: Almost Instance-Wise Optimality and the Gap Entropy Conjecture (Lijie Chen - 26 May, 2016)
The problem has a long history and attracted significant attention for the last decade.

However, we conjecture that modulo the additive term $Î©(Î_2^{-2} \ln\ln Î_2^{-1})$ (which is an upper bound and worst case lower bound for the 2-arm problem), there is an instance optimal algorithm for BEST-1-ARM

In-Network Distributed Solar Current Prediction (Elizabeth Basha - 27 October, 2014)

In analyzing our results from this experiment, we determined that computing our model requires an increased energy expenditure of 4.5mJ over simpler models (on the order of 10^{-7}% of the harvested energy) to gain a prediction improvement of 39.7%.

A 3-factor approximation algorithm for a Maximum Acyclic Agreement Forest on k rooted, binary phylogenetic trees (Asish Mukhopadhyay - 6 September, 2016)
The evolutionary history of a set of species can be explained by more than one phylogenetic tree, giving rise to the problem of comparing phylogenetic trees for similarity. The distance between two phylogenetic trees can also be measured by the size of a Maximum Agreement Forest (MAF) on these trees, as it has been shown that the rooted subtree prune-and-regraft distance is 1 less than the size of a MAF. Recently, it has been shown that the MAF on k(>=2) trees can be approximated to within a factor of 8. In this paper, we improve this ratio to 3. It has been shown that this number is 1 less than the size of a Maximum Acyclic Agreement Forest (MAAF). We show that the MAAF for k(>= 2) phylogenetic trees can be approximated to within a factor of 3.

Our method significantly outperforms algorithms that address model uncertainty without explicitly reasoning about belief distributions, and is competitive with state-of-the-art Partially Observable Markov Decision Process solvers.

We present \textit{SoPhie}; an interpretable framework based on Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), which leverages two sources of information, the path history of all the agents in a scene, and the scene context information, using images of the scene. All these mechanisms enable our approach to predict socially and physically plausible paths for the agents and to achieve state-of-the-art performance on several different trajectory forecasting benchmarks.
