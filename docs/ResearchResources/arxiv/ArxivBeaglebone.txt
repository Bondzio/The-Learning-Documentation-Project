Application of a single-board computer as a low cost pulse generator (Marcus Fedrizzi - 27 April, 2015)
A BeagleBone Black (BBB) single-board open-source computer was implemented as a low-cost fully programmable pulse generator. The pulse generator makes use of the BBB Programmable Real-Time Unit (PRU) subsystem to achieve a deterministic temporal resolution of 5 ns, an RMS jitter of 290 ps and a timebase stability on the order of 10 ppm

Media Query Processing For The Internet-of-Things: Coupling Of Device Energy Consumption And Cloud Infrastructure Billing (Francesco Renna - 2 August, 2016)
Our analytic results are validated via a deployment with: (i) the device side comprising compact image descriptors (queries) computed on Beaglebone Linux embedded platforms and transmitted to Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service; (ii) the cloud side carrying out image similarity detection via AWS Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, with the AWS Auto Scaling being used to control the number of instances according to the demand.
