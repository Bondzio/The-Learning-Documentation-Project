A Fast, Compact, Accurate Model for Language Identification of Codemixed Text (Yuan Zhang - 9 October, 2018)
Such text is prevalent online, in documents, social media, and message boards. We show that a feed-forward network with a simple globally constrained decoder can accurately and rapidly label both codemixed and monolingual text in 100 languages and 100 language pairs. This model outperforms previously published multilingual approaches in terms of both accuracy and speed, yielding an 800x speed-up and a 19.5% averaged absolute gain on three codemixed datasets

Fundamental Limits of Covert Bit Insertion in Packets (Ramin Soltani - 8 October, 2018)
Covert transmitter Alice wishes to alter the packet stream in some way to send information to covert receiver Bob without watchful and capable adversary Willie being able to detect the presence of the message. We consider three scenarios: 1) packet sizes are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) with a probability mass function (pmf) whose support is a set of one bit spaced values; 2) packet sizes are i.i.d. with a pmf whose support is arbitrary; 3) packet sizes may be dependent

Distributed Hypothesis Testing with Collaborative Detection (Pierre Escamilla - 8 October, 2018)
Communication of these messages is assumed to be error-free but rate-limited. The joint probability mass function (pmf) of the source sequences observed at the three terminals depends on an $\mathsf{M}$-ary hypothesis $(\mathsf{M} \geq 2)$, and the goal of the communication is that each detector can guess the underlying hypothesis. Detector $k$, $k=1,2$, aims to maximize the error exponent \textit{under hypothesis} $i_k$, $i_k \in \{1,\ldots,\mathsf{M}\}$, while ensuring a small probability of error under all other hypotheses

Categorizing Defects in Infrastructure as Code (Akond Rahman - 21 September, 2018)
The goal of this paper is to help software practitioners improve their development process of infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts by categorizing the defect categories in IaC scripts based upon a qualitative analysis of commit messages and issue report descriptions. We use 1021, 3074, 7808, and 972 commits that map to 165, 580, 1383, and 296 IaC scripts, respectively, collected from Mirantis, Mozilla, Openstack, and Wikimedia Commons. With 89 raters we apply the defect type attribute of the orthogonal defect classification (ODC) methodology to categorize the defects. We also review prior literature that have used ODC to categorize defects, and compare the defect category distribution of IaC scripts with 26 non-IaC software systems. Respectively, for Mirantis, Mozilla, Openstack, and Wikimedia Commons, we observe (i) 49.3%, 36.5%, 57.6%, and 62.7% of the IaC defects to contain syntax and configuration-related defects; (ii) syntax and configuration-related defects are more prevalent amongst IaC scripts compared to that of previously-studied non-IaC software.

The $Îµ$-error Capacity of Symmetric PIR with Byzantine Adversaries (Qiwen Wang - 11 September, 2018)
The capacity of symmetric private information retrieval with $K$ messages, $N$ servers (out of which any $T$ may collude), and an omniscient Byzantine adversary (who can corrupt any $B$ answers) is shown to be $1 - \frac{T+2B}{N}$ [1], under the requirement of zero probability of error. In this work, we show that by weakening the adversary slightly (either providing secret low rate channels between the servers and the user, or limiting the observation of the adversary), and allowing vanishing probability of error, the capacity increases to $1 - \frac{T+B}{N}$.

In this paper, a 3-class intuitive BCI is presented which enables users to directly answer yes or no questions by covertly rehearsing the word 'yes' or 'no' for 15 s. Twelve participants each completed one offline block and six online blocks over the course of 2 sessions. By the final online block, 9 out of 12 participants were performing above chance (p<0.001), with a 3-class accuracy of 83.8+9.4%. Even when considering all participants, the average online 3-class accuracy over the last 3 blocks was 64.1+20.6%, with only 3 participants scoring below chance (p<0.001)

When $\frac{K}{M}$ is not an integer, we show that the converse rate of $M/K$ is achievable if $N \geq \frac{K}{\gcd(K,M)} - (\frac{M}{\gcd(K,M)}-1)(\lfloor \frac{K}{M} \rfloor -1)$, and the achievable rate of $1/\lceil \frac{K}{M} \rceil$ is optimal if $N = \lceil \frac{K}{M} \rceil$. Otherwise if $\lceil \frac{K}{M} \rceil < N < \frac{K}{\gcd(K,M)} - (\frac{M}{\gcd(K,M)}-1)(\lfloor \frac{K}{M} \rfloor -1)$, we give an improved achievable scheme and prove its optimality for several small settings.

The Capacity of Private Information Retrieval from Uncoded Storage Constrained Databases (Mohamed Adel Attia - 10 May, 2018)
The replicated databases scenario was considered by Sun and Jafar, 2016, where $N$ databases can store the same $K$ messages completely. A PIR scheme was developed to achieve the optimal download cost given by $\left(1+ \frac{1}{N}+ \frac{1}{N^{2}}+ \cdots + \frac{1}{N^{K-1}}\right)$. Each database has a storage capacity of $Î¼KL$ bits, where $L$ is the size of each message in bits, and $Î¼\in [1/N, 1]$ is the normalized storage. We aim to characterize the optimal download cost versus storage trade-off for any storage capacity in the range $Î¼\in [1/N, 1]$. In particular, for any $(N,K)$, we show that the optimal trade-off between storage, $Î¼$, and the download cost, $D(Î¼)$, is given by the lower convex hull of the $N$ pairs $\left(\frac{t}{N}, \left(1+ \frac{1}{t}+ \frac{1}{t^{2}}+ \cdots + \frac{1}{t^{K-1}}\right)\right)$ for $t=1,2,\ldots, N$.

RF-PUF: Enhancing IoT Security through Authentication of Wireless Nodes using In-situ Machine Learning (Baibhab Chatterjee - 18 June, 2018)
Traditional authentication in radio-frequency (RF) systems enable secure data communication within a network through techniques such as digital signatures and hash-based message authentication codes (HMAC), which suffer from key recovery attacks. State-of-the-art IoT networks such as Nest also use Open Authentication (OAuth 2.0) protocols that are vulnerable to cross-site-recovery forgery (CSRF), which shows that these techniques may not prevent an adversary from copying or modeling the secret IDs or encryption keys using invasive, side channel, learning or software attacks. Simulation results involving the process variations in a standard 65 nm technology node, and features such as LO offset and I-Q imbalance detected with a neural network having 50 neurons in the hidden layer indicate that the framework can distinguish up to 4800 transmitters with an accuracy of 99.9% (~ 99% for 10,000 transmitters) under varying channel conditions, and without the need for traditional preambles.

Intense Competition can Drive Selfish Explorers to Optimize Coverage (Simon Collet - 3 May, 2018)
The main takeaway message of this paper is that the optimal symmetric coverage is expected to emerge when collision costs are relatively high, so that the following "Judgment of Solomon" type of rule holds: If a single player explores a site x then it gains its full reward f(x), but if several players explore it, then neither one receives any reward. Viewing the coverage measure as the social welfare, this policy thus enjoys a (Symmetric) Price of Anarchy of precisely 1, whereas, in fact, any other congestion policy has a price strictly greater than 1

To achieve the capacity, the servers need to share a common random variable (independent of the messages), and its size must be at least $\frac{E}{N} \cdot \frac{1}{C}$ symbols per message symbol

Further, it is required that each transmitter has at least 1 bit correlated randomness (that is independent of the messages) per message bit and the size of correlated randomness at all K transmitters is at least K-1 bits per message bit.

Sparse Matrix Multiplication in the Congested Clique model (Keren Censor-Hillel - 10 May, 2018)
We show how to multiply two $n \times n$ matrices $S$ and $T$ over semirings in the \clique model, where $n$ nodes communicate in a fully connected synchronous network using $O(\log{n})$-bit messages, within $O(nz(S)^{1/3} nz(T)^{1/3}/n)$ rounds of communication, where $nz(S)$ and $nz(T)$ denote the number of non-zero elements in $S$ and $T$, respectively. By leveraging the sparsity of the input matrices, our algorithm greatly reduces communication costs compared with general multiplication algorithms [Censor-Hillel et al., PODC 2015], and thus improves upon the state-of-the-art for matrices with $o(n^2)$ non-zero elements. Particularly, this allows to efficiently raise a sparse matrix to a power greater than 2.

Power Allocation Strategy of Maximizing Secrecy Rate for Secure Directional Modulation Networks (Simin Wan - 6 February, 2018)
In this paper, given the beamforming vector of confidential messages and artificial noise (AN) projection matrix and total power constraint, a power allocation (PA) strategy of maximizing secrecy rate (Max-SR) is proposed for secure directional modulation (DM) networks. From simulation results, we find the following facts: in the medium and high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regions, compared with three typical PA parameters such $Î²=0.1, 0.5$, and $0.9$, the optimal PA shows a substantial SR performance gain with maximum gain percent up to more than $60\%$. Additionally, as the PA factor increases from 0 to 1, the achievable SR increases accordingly in the low SNR region whereas it first increases and then decreases in the medium and high SNR regions, where the SR can be approximately viewed as a convex function of the PA factor

Private Information Retrieval from Storage Constrained Databases -- Coded Caching meets PIR (Maryam Abdul-Wahid - 14 November, 2017)
Each database has a storage capacity of $Î¼KL$ bits, where $K$ is the number of messages, $L$ is the size of each message in bits, and $Î¼\in [1/N, 1]$ is the normalized storage. In particular, for any $(N,K)$, with normalized storage $Î¼= t/N$, where the parameter $t$ can take integer values $t \in \{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$, we show that our proposed PIR scheme achieves a download cost of $\left(1+ \frac{1}{t}+ \frac{1}{t^{2}}+ \cdots + \frac{1}{t^{K-1}}\right)$. For this extremal setting, our scheme recovers the information-theoretically optimal download cost characterized by Sun and Jafar as $\left(1+ \frac{1}{N}+ \cdots + \frac{1}{N^{K-1}}\right)$. The interesting aspect of the result is that for intermediate values of storage, i.e., $1/N < Î¼<1$, the proposed scheme can strictly outperform memory-sharing between extreme values of storage.

In particular, for a given cache storage parameter $S$, the information-theoretically optimal download cost $D^{*}(S)/L$ (or the inverse of capacity) is shown to be equal to $(1- \frac{S}{K})\left(1+ \frac{1}{N}+ \ldots + \frac{1}{N^{K-1}}\right)$. Special cases of this result correspond to the settings when $S=0$, for which the optimal download cost was shown by Sun and Jafar to be $\left(1+ \frac{1}{N}+ \ldots + \frac{1}{N^{K-1}}\right)$, and the case when $S=K$, i.e., cache size is large enough to store all messages locally, for which the optimal download cost is $0$.

In this case, $C_s^P=\frac{1-\frac{1}{N}}{1-(\frac{1}{N})^{M/P}}$.

Rate $\frac{1}{3}$ Index Coding: Forbidden and Feasible Configurations (V. Lalitha - 24 January, 2017)
Linear index coding can be formulated as an interference alignment problem, in which precoding vectors of the minimum possible length are to be assigned to the messages in such a way that the precoding vector of a demand (at some receiver) is independent of the space of the interference (non side-information) precoding vectors. An index code has rate $\frac{1}{l}$ if the assigned vectors are of length $l$. In this paper, we introduce the notion of strictly rate $\frac{1}{L}$ message subsets which must necessarily be allocated precoding vectors from a strictly $L$-dimensional space ($L=1,2,3$) in any rate $\frac{1}{3}$ code. We develop a general necessary condition for rate $\frac{1}{3}$ feasibility using intersections of strictly rate $\frac{1}{L}$ message subsets. We apply the necessary condition to show that the presence of certain interference configurations makes the index coding problem rate $\frac{1}{3}$ infeasible. We also obtain a class of index coding problems, containing certain interference configurations, which are rate $\frac{1}{3}$ feasible based on the idea of \textit{contractions} of an index coding problem. Our necessary conditions for rate $\frac{1}{3}$ feasibility and the class of rate $\frac{1}{3}$ feasible problems obtained subsume all such known results for rate $\frac{1}{3}$ index coding.

Efficient Communications in Training Large Scale Neural Networks (Linnan Wang - 15 April, 2017)
The state-of-the-art method, Bulk Synchronous Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent (BSP-SGD), requires many collective communication operations, like broadcasts of parameters or reductions for sub-gradient aggregations, which for large messages quickly dominates overall execution time and limits parallel scalability. LP also demonstrate up to 2x faster bandwidth than Bidirectional Exchange (BE) techniques that are widely adopted by current MPI implementations

UTCNN: a Deep Learning Model of Stance Classificationon on Social Media Text (Wei-Fan Chen - 11 November, 2016)
UTCNN not only works on social media texts, but also analyzes texts in forums and message boards. Experiments performed on Chinese Facebook data and English online debate forum data show that UTCNN achieves a 0.755 macro-average f-score for supportive, neutral, and unsupportive stance classes on Facebook data, which is significantly better than models in which either user, topic, or comment information is withheld. In addition, UTCNN yields a 0.842 accuracy on English online debate forum data, which also significantly outperforms results from previous work as well as other deep learning models, showing that UTCNN performs well regardless of language or platform.

Oh-RAM! One and a Half Round Atomic Memory (Theophanis Hadjistasi - 26 October, 2016)
It is well known that 2 communication round-trip phases involving in total 4 message exchanges are sufficient to implemented atomic operations. We present algorithms that allow operations to complete in 3 communication exchanges without imposing any constraints on the number of readers and writers. Specifically, we present an atomic memory implementation for the SWMR setting, where reads complete in 3 communication exchanges and writes complete in 2 exchanges. We pose the question of whether it is possible to implement MWMR memory where operations complete in at most 3 communication exchanges. We answer this question in the negative by showing that an atomic memory implementation is impossible if both read and write operations take 3 communication exchanges, even when assuming two writers, two readers, and a single replica server failure. Motivated by this impossibility result, we provide a MWMR atomic memory implementation where reads involve 3 and writes 4 communication exchanges

Hybrid-DCA: A Double Asynchronous Approach for Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (Soumitra Pal - 2 November, 2016)
In prior works, stochastic dual coordinate ascent (SDCA) has been parallelized in a multi-core environment where the cores communicate through shared memory, or in a multi-processor distributed memory environment where the processors communicate through message passing. Big datasets, such as one of 280 GB from the LIBSVM repository, cannot be accommodated on a single node and hence cannot be solved by a parallel algorithm. For such a dataset, our hybrid algorithm takes 30 seconds to achieve a duality gap of $10^{-6}$ on 16 nodes each using 8 cores, which is significantly faster than the best known distributed algorithms, such as CoCoA+, that take more than 300 seconds on 16 nodes.

Multi-Phase Smart Relaying and Cooperative Jamming in Secure Cognitive Radio Networks (Pin-Hsun Lin - 13 May, 2016)
In addition, we propose a multi-phase transmission scheme to include 1) the phases of the clean relaying with cooperative jamming and 2) the latency to successfully decode the primary message at the secondary transmitter. Numerical results show that: 1) the proposed scheme can outperform the traditional ones by properly selecting the secondary user's parameters of different transmission schemes according to the relative positions of the nodes; 2) the derived capacity upper bound is close to the secondary user's achievable rate within 0.3 bits/channel use, especially when the secondary transmitter/receiver is far/close enough to the primary receiver/transmitter, respectively

Fast Semantic Image Segmentation with High Order Context and Guided Filtering (Falong Shen - 13 May, 2016)
At the coarse level, we combine local feature representation and context interaction using a deep convolutional network, and directly learn the interaction from high order cliques with a message passing routine, avoiding time-consuming explicit graph inference for joint probability distribution. Experimental results on Pascal VOC 2012 dataset have shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art, and that it achieves the rank 1 performance at the time of submission, both of which prove the effectiveness of this unified framework for semantic image segmentation.

Achievable Sum DoF of the K-User MIMO Interference Channel with Delayed CSIT (Chenxi Hao - 5 May, 2016)
The usefulness of the delayed CSIT was firstly identified in a $K$-phase Retrospective Interference Alignment (RIA) scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali et al for the Multiple-Input-Single-Output Broadcast Channel, but the extension to the MIMO IC is a non-trivial step as each transmitter only has the message intended for the corresponding user. For the case $\frac{M}{N}{\geq}K$, the achieved sum DoF is asymptotically given by $\frac{64}{15}N$ when $K{\to}\infty$.

Enabling Relaying Over Heterogeneous Backhauls in the Uplink of Wireless Femtocell Networks (Sumudu Samarakoon - 29 April, 2016)
To this end, we propose a rate-splitting technique using which the MUEs optimize their uplink transmissions by dividing their signals into two types: a coarse message that is intended for direct transmission to the macrocell base station and a fine message that is decoded by a neighboring femtocell and subsequently relayed over a heterogeneous (wireless/wired) backhaul. Simulation results show that the proposed approach yields up to 125% rate improvement and up to 2 times delay reduction with wired backhaul and, 150% rate improvement and up to 10 times delay reduction with wireless backhaul, relative to classical interference management approaches, with no cross-tier cooperation.

The data includes information about location, physical motion, face-to-face contacts, online social network friends, text messages and calls. As an alternative to the Big Five, we investigate whether other linear combinations of the 44 questions underlying the Big Five Inventory are more predictable. In a tertile classification problem, basic dimensionality reduction techniques, such as independent component analysis, increase the predictability relative to the baseline from $11\%$ to $23\%$. Finally, from a supervised linear classifier, we were able to further improve this predictability to $33\%$. In addition, our findings indicate that the score system underlying the Big Five Inventory disregards a part of the information available in the 44 questions.

Optimal Collision/Conflict-free Distance-2 Coloring in Synchronous Broadcast/Receive Tree Networks (Davide Frey - 13 January, 2016)
In such a communication model, no two neighbors of the same process, nor a process and any of its neighbors, must be allowed to broadcast during the same time slot (thereby preventing message collisions in the first case, and message conflicts in the second case). From a graph theory point of view, the allocation of slots to processes is know as the distance-2 coloring problem: a color must be associated with each process (defining the time slots in which it will be allowed to broadcast) in such a way that any two processes at distance at most 2 obtain different colors, while the total number of colors is "as small as possible". This algorithm, which is itself collision-free and conflict-free, uses $Î+ 1$ colors where $Î$ is the maximal degree of the graph (hence the algorithm is color-optimal)

Further, for an integer parameter $Ï\geq 0$, we say that the adversary providing the dynamic network is $Ï$-oblivious if for constructing the graph of some round $t$, the adversary has access to all the randomness (and states) of the algorithm up to round $t-Ï$.

Each user requests one file from the library according to a common demand distribution and the server sends a coded multicast message to satisfy all users at once. In this paper, we consider the generalization to the case where each user places L >= 1 independent requests according to the same common demand distribution. We then show that the scalar (B = 1) version of the proposed scheme can still preserve order-optimality when the number of per-user requests L is large enough

Identifying Actionable Messages on Social Media (Nemanja Spasojevic - 2 November, 2015)
In this paper, we propose a supervised learning framework for domain-aware, large-scale actionability classification of social media messages. We derive lexicons, perform an in-depth analysis for over 25 text based features, and explore strategies to handle domains that have limited training data. We apply these methods to over 46 million messages spanning 75 companies and 35 languages, from both Facebook and Twitter. The models achieve an aggregate population-weighted F measure of 0.78 and accuracy of 0.74, with values of over 0.9 in some cases.

For the synchronized-start case, when all the nodes start an execution simultaneously, we give a randomized algorithm that computes a backbone of the network in $O(Î\log^{7} N)$ rounds with high probability. Finally, in the partly-coordinated-start case, when a number of nodes start an execution together and other nodes are awoken by receiving messages from the already awoken nodes, we develop an algorithm that creates a backbone network in time $O(n\log^2 N +Î\log^{7} N)$ with high probability.

The compliance relation is shown to be decidable by means of 1) a procedure synthesising the orchestrators, if any, making a client compliant with a server, and 2) a procedure for deciding whether an orchestrator behaves in a proper way as mentioned before.

Furthermore, the size of each message is $O(1)$ thus its bit complexity is also $O(n).$ We provide some links between this enumeration and Hamiltonian graphs from which we deduce that this enumeration is optimal in the sense that there does not exist an enumeration which satisfies that two vertices with consecutive numbers are at distance at most $2$.

To measure cooperative awareness, we use three metrics: 1) neighborhood awareness ratio; 2) ratio of neighbors above range; and 3) packet delivery rate. ii) the efficacy of cooperative awareness varies greatly in different environments on both large scale (e.g., 90\% awareness is achievable up to 200~m in urban and over 500~m in highway) and small scale (e.g., vehicles in nearby streets can have significantly different awareness); iii) V2V and V2I communication have distinct awareness patterns; iv) each location has a distinct transmit power that achieves high awareness; and v) achieving high awareness levels results in increased reception of potentially unwanted messages; therefore, a balance needs to be found between awareness and interference, depending on the specific context

Identifying Relevant Messages in a Twitter-based Citizen Channel for Natural Disaster Situations (Alfredo Cobo - 18 March, 2015)
During recent years the online social networks (in particular Twitter) have become an important alternative information channel to traditional media during natural disasters, but the amount and diversity of messages poses the challenge of information overload to end users. By using a dataset from the Chilean earthquake of 2010, we first build and validate a ground truth, and then we contribute by presenting in detail the effect of class imbalance and dimensionality reduction over 5 classifiers

Secure Degrees of Freedom Region of the Two-User MISO Broadcast Channel with Alternating CSIT (Pritam Mukherjee - 9 February, 2015)
The two user multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel with confidential messages (BCCM) is studied in which the nature of channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) from each user can be of the form $I_{i}$, $i=1,2$ where $I_{1}, I_{2}\in \{\mathsf{P}, \mathsf{D}, \mathsf{N}\}$, and the forms $\mathsf{P}$, $\mathsf{D}$ and $\mathsf{N}$ correspond to perfect and instantaneous, completely delayed, and no CSIT, respectively. Thus, the overall CSIT can alternate between $9$ possible states corresponding to all possible values of $I_{1}I_{2}$, with each state occurring for $Î»_{I_{1}I_{2}}$ fraction of the total duration. The main contribution of this paper is to establish the secure degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) region of the MISO BCCM with alternating CSIT with the symmetry assumption, where $Î»_{I_{1} I_{2}}=Î»_{I_{2}I_{1}}$.

ECPR: Environment- and Context-aware Combined Power and Rate Distributed Congestion Control for Vehicular Communications (Bengi Aygun - 5 June, 2016)
Studying various operational conditions (e.g., speed, direction, and application requirement), ECPR adjusts the transmit power of the messages in order to reach the desired awareness ratio at the target distance while at the same time controlling the channel load using an adaptive rate control algorithm. By performing extensive simulations, including realistic propagation as well as environment modeling and realistic vehicle operational environments (varying demand on both awareness range and rate), we show that ECPR can increase awareness by 20% while keeping the channel load and interference at almost the same level. When permitted by the awareness requirements, ECPR can improve the average message rate by 18% compared to algorithms that perform rate adaptation only.

Time-Free and Timer-Based Assumptions Can Be Combined to Solve Authenticated Byzantine Consensus (Hamouma Moumen - 30 January, 2015)
In the context of Byzantine failures for systems where at most t processes may exhibit a Byzantine behavior, two approaches have been investigated to solve the consensus problem.The first, relies on the addition of synchrony, called Timer-Based, but the second is based on the pattern of the messages that are exchanged, called Time-Free. This combined assumption considers a correct process pi, called 2t-BW, and a set X of 2t processes such that, eventually, for each query broadcasted by a correct process pj of X, pj receives a response from pi 2 X among the (n- t) first responses to that query or both links connecting pi and pj are timely

To decode the intended messages at receivers, a joint processing/simultaneous decoding technique, which exploits the availability of several receive antennas, is proposed. It is observed that $K\times 2$ and $2\times K$, X channels with $M$ antennas at all transmitters/receivers enjoy duality in Degrees of Freedom (DoF). It is shown that incorporating the layered interference alignment is essential to characterize the total DoF of $\frac{2KM}{K+1}$ in the $K\times 2$ and $2\times K$, $M$ antenna X channels.

Optimal Coding Schemes for the Three-Receiver AWGN Broadcast Channel with Receiver Message Side Information (Behzad Asadi - 28 July, 2015)
This paper investigates the capacity region of the three-receiver AWGN broadcast channel where the receivers (i) have private-message requests and (ii) may know some of the messages requested by other receivers as side information. We first classify all 64 possible side information configurations into eight groups, each consisting of eight members. This establishes the capacity region for 52 out of 64 possible side information configurations. For six groups (i.e., groups 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8 in our terminology), we establish the capacity region for all their members, and show that it tightens both the best known inner and outer bounds. For group 4, our inner and outer bounds tighten the best known inner bound and/or outer bound for all the group members. For group 7, our inner and outer bounds coincide for four members, thereby establishing the capacity region

We propose inner and outer bounds for the two remaining groups, groups 4 and 7. For group 4, the inner and outer bounds coincide at certain regions. For group 7, the inner and outer bounds coincide, thereby establishing the capacity, for four members out of all eight members of the group; for the remaining four members, the proposed bounds reduce the gap between the best known inner and outer bounds.

In this paper, we consider the Ice-Wine problem: Two transmitters send their messages over the Gaussian Multiple-Access Channel (MAC) and a receiver aims to recover a linear combination of codewords. The best known achievable rate-region for this problem is due to [1],[2] as $R_{i}\leq\frac{1}{2}\log\left(\frac{1}{2}+{\rm SNR}\right)$ $(i=1,2)$. The main difference between our proposed scheme with known schemes in [1],[2] is that instead of recovering the sum of codewords at the decoder, a non-integer linear combination of codewords is recovered. Comparing the achievable rate-region with the outer bound, $R_{i}\leq\frac{1}{2}\log\left(1+{\rm SNR}\right)\,\,(i=1,2)$, we observe that the achievable rate for each user is partially tight

Gaussian Multiple Access via Compute-and-Forward (Jingge Zhu - 28 August, 2016)
Lattice codes used under the Compute-and-Forward paradigm suggest an alternative strategy for the standard Gaussian multiple-access channel (MAC): The receiver successively decodes integer linear combinations of the messages until it can invert and recover all messages. For the two-user MAC, it is shown that without time-sharing, the entire capacity region can be attained using CFMA with a single-user decoder as soon as the signal-to-noise ratios are above $1+\sqrt{2}$

Cellular Interference Alignment: Omni-Directional Antennas and Asymmetric Configurations (Vasilis Ntranos - 31 July, 2014)
Assuming that neighboring sectors can exchange decoded messages (and not received signal samples) in the uplink, we showed that linear one-shot IA precoding over $M$ transmit/receive antennas can achieve the optimal $M/2$ DoFs per user. In this paper we extend this framework to networks with omni-directional (non-sectorized) cells and consider the practical scenario where users have $2$ antennas, and base-stations have $2$, $3$ or $4$ antennas. In particular, we provide linear one-shot IA schemes for the $2\times 2$, $2\times3$ and $2\times 4$ cases, and show the achievability of $3/4$, $1$ and $7/6$ DoFs per user, respectively. This approach is used to show that the achievable $3/4$ DoFs per user are indeed optimal for a large (extended) cellular network with $2\times 2$ links.

Random Access Channel Coding in the Finite Blocklength Regime (Michelle Effros - 7 February, 2018)
The decoder is tasked with decoding from the channel output the number of active transmitters ($k$) and their messages but not with determining which transmitter sent which message; the decoding procedure occurs at a time $n_{\hat{k}}$ dependent on its estimate $\hat{k}$ of the number of active transmitters, thereby achieving a rate that varies with the number of active transmitters. A coding environment with identical encoders, permutation-invariant channels, and decoders charged with decoding messages but not transmitter identities was recently introduced for the Multiple Access Channel (MAC) with a fixed, known number of transmitters by Polyanskiy.

A single unicast index coding problem (SUICP) with symmetric neighboring and consecutive side-information (SNCS) has $K$ messages and $K$ receivers, the $k$th receiver $R_k$ wanting the $k$th message $x_k$ and having the side-information $\mathcal{K}_k=\{x_{k-U},\dots,x_{k-2},x_{k-1}\}\cup\{x_{k+1}, x_{k+2},\dots,x_{k+D}\}$. By using the proposed decoding method, every receiver is able to decode its wanted message symbol by simply adding some index code symbols (broadcast symbols).

Randomized Communication in Radio Networks (Bogdan S. Chlebus - 29 December, 2017)
