Three Efficient, Low-Complexity Algorithms for Automatic Color Trapping (Haiyin Wang - 21 August, 2018)
For mechanical reasons, these color separations are generally not perfectly aligned with respect to each other when they are rendered by their respective imaging stations. The first LUT-based algorithm corrects all registration errors of one pixel in extent and reduces several cases of misregistration errors of two pixels in extent using only 727 Kbytes of storage space. The second LUT-based algorithm corrects all types of misregistration errors of up to two pixels in extent using 3.7 Mbytes of storage space. The third algorithm is a hybrid one that combines LUTs and feature extraction to minimize the storage requirements (724 Kbytes) while still correcting all misregistration errors of up to two pixels in extent

A Crowdsourcing Approach To Collecting Tutorial Videos -- Toward Personalized Learning-at-Scale (Jacob Whitehill - 22 April, 2017)
Results of our study, in which we collected 399 videos from 66 unique "teachers" on Mechanical Turk, suggest that (1) approximately 100 videos -- over $80\%$ of which are mathematically fully correct -- can be crowdsourced per week for \$5/video; (2) the crowdsourced videos exhibit significant diversity in terms of language style, presentation media, and pedagogical approach; (3) the average learning gains (posttest minus pretest score) associated with watching the videos was stat.~sig.~higher than for a control video ($0.105$ versus $0.045$); and (4) the average learning gains ($0.1416$) from watching the best tested crowdsourced videos was comparable to the learning gains ($0.1506$) from watching a popular Khan Academy video on logarithms.

Finding Proofs in Tarskian Geometry (Michael Beeson - 22 June, 2016)
We distinguish between proofs that were found completely mechanically (without reference to the steps of a book proof) and proofs that were constructed by some technique that involved a human knowing the steps of a book proof. Proofs of length 40--100, roughly speaking, are difficult exercises for a human, and proofs of 100-250 steps belong in a Ph.D. 29 of the proofs in our collection are longer than 40 steps, and ten are longer than 90 steps. We were able to derive completely mechanically all but 26 of the 183 theorems that have "short" proofs (40 or fewer deduction steps). We found proofs of the rest, as well as the 29 "hard" theorems, using a method that requires consulting the book proof at the outset. Our "subformula strategy" enabled us to prove four of the 29 hard theorems completely mechanically. level proofs, of length up to 108.

Crowdsourcing for Identification of Polyp-Free Segments in Virtual Colonoscopy Videos (Ji Hwan Park - 24 July, 2017)

Using the crowd results as a first pass, 80% of the video segments could in theory be skipped by the radiologist, equating to a significant time savings and enabling more VC examinations to be performed.

Mobile Icosapods (Matteo Gallet - 23 March, 2016)
Pods are mechanical devices constituted of two rigid bodies, the base and the platform, connected by a number of other rigid bodies, called legs, that are anchored via spherical joints. It is possible to prove that the maximal number of legs of a mobile pod, when finite, is 20. In 1904, Borel designed a technique to construct examples of such 20-pods, but could not constrain the legs to have base and platform points with real coordinates

A Novel X-Axis Tuning Fork Gyroscope with "8 Vertical Springs-Proofmass" Structure on (111)-Silicon (Fei Duan - 21 February, 2008)
Compared with the common single-plane springs, the 8 vertical springs, symmetrically located at the top and bottom sides, more stably suspend the large thick proofmass featuring large capacitance variation and low mechanical noise. During the fabrication process, the dimensions of the 8 vertical springs are precisely confined by thermal oxide protected limit trenches (LTs) sidewalls and the extreme slowly etched (111)-planes; therefore a small mismatch of less than 30 Hz is achieved before tuning
