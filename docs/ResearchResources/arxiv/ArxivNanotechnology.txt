Synthesis of Majority Expressions through Primitive Function Manipulation (Evandro C. Ferraz - 1 October, 2018)
Due to technology advancements and circuits miniaturization, the study of logic systems that can be applied to nanotechnology has been progressing steadily. Tests have shown that both algorithms return optimal solutions for all functions with 3 input variables. For functions with 4 inputs, the MPC is able to further improve 42,987 (66%) functions and achieves equal results for 7,198 (11%). For functions with 5 input variables, out of a sample of 1,000 randomly generated functions, the MPC further improved 477 (48%) functions and achieved equal results for 112 (11%).

Computational design of metal-supported molecular switches: Transient ion formation during light- and electron-induced isomerisation of azobenzene (Reinhard J. Maurer - 13 August, 2018)
In molecular nanotechnology, a single molecule is envisioned to act as the basic building block of electronic devices. Employing dispersion-corrected Density-Functional Theory (DFT) and linear expansion Delta-Self-Consistent-Field DFT, the electronic structure of a prototypical surface-adsorbed functional molecule, namely azobenzene adsorbed to (111) single crystal facets of copper, silver and gold, is investigated and the main reasons for the loss or survival of the switching function upon adsorption are identified. The light-induced switching ability of a functionalised derivative of azobenzene on Au(111) and azobenzene on Ag(111) and Au(111) is assessed based on the excited-state potential energy landscapes of their transient molecular ions, which are believed to be the main intermediates of the experimentally observed isomerisation reaction

Writing on Nanocrystals: Patterning Colloidal Inorganic Nanocrystal Films through Irradiation-Induced Chemical Transformations of Surface Ligands (Francisco Palazon - 5 January, 2018)
In the past couple of decades, colloidal inorganic nanocrystals and, more specifically, semiconductor quantum dots have emerged as crucial materials for the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, with applications in very diverse areas such as optoelectronics and biotechnology. A few reports from the late 1990 and early 2000 used such direct lithography to fabricate electrical wires from metallic NCs. In the early 2010, the same method was used to define fluorescent patterns on QD films, allowing for further applications in biosensing. For the past 2 ,3 years, direct lithography on NC films with e-beams and X rays has gone through an important development as it has been demonstrated that it can tune further transformations on the NCs, leading to more complex patternings and opening a whole new set of possible applications.

Contrasting behavior of covalent and molecular carbon allotropes exposed to extreme ultraviolet and soft x-ray free-electron laser radiation (M. ToufarovÃ¡ - 6 December, 2017)
All carbon materials, e.g., amorphous carbon (a-C) coatings and C60 fullerene thin films, play an important role in short-wavelength free-electron laser (FEL) research motivated by FEL optics development and prospective nanotechnology applications. Low thresholds for ablation of a fullerene crystal (estimated to be around 0.15 eV/atom for C60 vs 0.9 eV/atom for a-C in terms of the absorbed dose) are caused by a low cohesive energy of fullerene crystals

Tuning the Dirac Cone of Bilayer and Bulk Structure Graphene by Intercalating First Row Transition Metals using First Principles Calculations (Srimanta Pakhira - 22 November, 2017)
Recent advancement in graphene nanotechnology opens a new avenue of creating 2D bilayer graphene (BLG) intercalates. Using first-principles DFT techniques, we have designed 20 new materials \textit{in-silico} by intercalating first row transition metals (TMs) with BLG, i.e. 10 layered structure and 10 bulk crystal structures of TM intercalated in BLG. The present DFT calculations show that the 2$p_z$ sub-shells of C atoms in graphene and the 3$d_{yz}$ sub-shells of the TM atoms provide the electron density near the Fermi level controlling the material properties of the BLG-intercalated materials

Existence theorems for a crystal surface model involving the p-Laplace operator (Xiangsheng Xu - 14 June, 2018)
The manufacturing of crystal films lies at the heart of modern nanotechnology. To be specific, we study the existence of a weak solution to the boundary value problem for the equation $ - Îe^{-\mbox{div}\left(|\nabla u|^{p-2}\nabla u\right)}+au=f$, where $p>1, a>0$ are given numbers and $f$ is a given function. This problem is derived from a crystal surface model proposed by J.L.~Marzuola and J.~Weare (2013 Physical Review, E 88, 032403). Existence of a suitably-defined weak solution is established under the assumptions that $p\in(1,2], \ N\leq 4$, and $f\in W^{1,p}$

Mechanics of an Asymmetric Hard--Soft Lamellar Nanomaterial (Weichao Shi - 31 January, 2017)

Here, we report on the structure and mechanics of highly asymmetric and thermodynamically stable soft--hard lamellar structures self-assembled from optimally designed PS1-(PI-b-PS2)3 miktoarm star block copolymers. The remarkable mechanical properties of these strong and ductile PS (polystyrene)-based nanomaterials can be tuned over a broad range by varying the hard layer thickness while maintaining the soft layer thickness constant at 13 nm. Upon deformation, thin PS lamellae (\textless{}100 nm) exhibited kinks and predamaged/damaged grains, as well as cavitation in the soft layers. In contrast, deformation of thick lamellae (\textgreater{}100 nm) manifests cavitation in both soft and hard nanolayers

Multidisciplinary Cognitive Content of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology (StaÅ¡a MilojeviÄ - 31 March, 2012)
This article examines the cognitive evolution and disciplinary diversity of nanotechnology as expressed through the terminology used in titles of nano journal articles. The analysis is based on the NanoBank bibliographic database of 287,106 nano articles published between 1981 and 2004. We perform multifaceted analyses of title words, focusing on 100 most frequent terms. Hierarchical clustering of title terms reveals three distinct time periods of cognitive development of nano research: formative (1981-1990), early (1991-1998), and current (after 1998). Currently only 5% of articles are published in dedicated nano-only journals. We find that some 85% of nano research today is multidisciplinary

Atomic-scale effects behind structural instabilities in Si lamellae during ion beam thinning (Eero HolmstrÃ¶m - 3 February, 2012)
The rise of nanotechnology has created an ever-increasing need to probe structures on the atomic scale, to which transmission electron microscopy has largely been the answer. Specifically, we show that attaining thickness below 26 nm using a milling energy of 30 keV is fundamentally prevented by atomistic effects at the top edge of the lamella

Heat conductivity of DNA double helix (Alexander V. Savin - 23 May, 2011)
Thermal conductivity of isolated single molecule DNA fragments is of importance for nanotechnology, but has not yet been measured experimentally. Within the proposed model each nucleotide is represented by 6 particles or grains; the grains interact via effective potentials inferred from classical molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories based on a well-established all-atom potential function. Comparisons of 10 ns long MD trajectories between the CG and the corresponding all-atom model show similar root-mean-square deviations from the canonical B-form DNA, and similar structural fluctuations. At the same time, the CG model is 10 to 100 times faster depending on the length of the DNA fragment in the simulation. For a uniform (polyG-polyC) DNA, the estimated conductivity coefficient is 0.3 W/mK which is half the value of thermal conductivity for water

A Map of the Nanoworld: Sizing up the Science, Politics, and Business of the Infinitesimal (Debashish Munshi - 23 October, 2005)
Mapping out the eight main nodes of nanotechnology discourse that have emerged in the past decade, we explore how various scientific, social, and ethical islands of discussion have developed, been recognized, and are being continually renegotiated. We do so by (1) identifying the ways in which scientists, policy makers, entrepreneurs, educators, and environmental groups have drawn boundaries on issues relating to nanotechnology; (2) describing concisely the perspectives from which these boundaries are drawn; and (3) exploring how boundaries on nanotechnology are marked and negotiated by various nodes of nanotechnology discourse.
