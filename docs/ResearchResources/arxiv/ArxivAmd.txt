Site-specific spin crossover in Fe$_{2}$TiO$_{4}$ post-spinel under high pressures to near a megabar (W. M. Xu - 24 September, 2018)
X-ray diffraction studies to ~90 GPa at room temperature show that Fe$_{2}$TiO$_{4}$ ferrous inverse spinel undergoes the following sequence of structural transitions : cubic (Fd3m) to tetragonal (I41/amd)to orthorhombic(Cmcm) to orthorhombic(Pmma),at the indicated onset transition pressures. This is manifest as a steeper volume decrease of dV/V0 ~ 3.5% beyond ~40 GPa and an emergent diamagnetic component discerned in 57Fe MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy at variable cryogenic temperatures. The rest of the high-spin Fe in 6-fold and 8-fold coordinated sites (~75% abundance) in the Pmma phase exhibit average saturation internal magnetic fields of H$_{hf}$ ~ 42 T to ~90 GPa, typical of spin-only (orbitally quenched) Fermi-contact values. By contrast average H$_{hf}$ ~ 20 T values, signifying unquenched orbital moments, occur below the 40-45 GPa spin-crossover initiation regime in the Cmcm phase. Near ~90 GPa Fe$_{2}$TiO$_{4}$ is a partially spin-converted chemically ordered Pmma post-spinel structure having a persistent charge gap of ~100 meV

Comment on "Structure Prediction of Li-Sn and Li-Sb Intermetallics for Lithium-Ion Batteries Anodes'' (Raja Sen - 27 July, 2018)
In a recently published article Mayo et al.[Chemistry of Materials 2017, 29, 5787] presented the ground state crystal structures of various experimentally unknown Li-Sn intermetallic compounds at ambient pressure (~0 GPa) and 0 K temperature using ab-initio random structure searching method (AIRSS) with high-throughput screening from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD).\cite{AIRSS} In their study, besides the experimentally known phases of Li-Sn such as, $\mathrm{Li_{2}Sn_{5}}$ ($\mathrm{P4/mbm}$),$\mathrm{Li_{1}Sn_{1}}$ ($\mathrm{P2/m}$, $\mathrm{I4_{1}/amd}$), $\mathrm{Li_{7}Sn_{3}}$ ($\mathrm{P2_{1}/m}$), $\mathrm{Li_{5}Sn_{2}}$ ($\mathrm{R\bar{3}m}$), $\mathrm{Li_{13}Sn_{5}}$ ($\mathrm{P\bar{3}m1}$), $\mathrm{Li_{7}Sn_{2}}$ ($\mathrm{Cmmm}$), and $\mathrm{Li_{17}Sn_{4}}$ ($\mathrm{F\bar{4}3m}$), Mayo et al. also reported two previously unknown stable phases for Li-Sn such as, $\mathrm{Li_{8}Sn_{3}}$-$\mathrm{R\bar{3}m}$ and $\mathrm{Li_{7}Sn_{2}}$-$\mathrm{P\bar{1}}$ along with several Li-Sn metastable phases ($\mathrm{Li_{1}Sn_{2}}$, $\mathrm{Li_{2}Sn_{3}}$, $\mathrm{Li_{7}Sn_{9}}$, $\mathrm{Li_{3}Sn_{2}}$, $\mathrm{Li_{5}Sn_{3}}$, $\mathrm{Li_{2}Sn}_{1}$, $\mathrm{Li_{3}Sn_{1}}$, $\mathrm{Li_{4}Sn_{1}}$, $\mathrm{Li_{5}Sn_{1}}$, and $\mathrm{Li_{7}Sn_{1}}$) which lie within 20 meV/atom from the convex hull tie-line.

Strong electron-phonon and band structure effects in the optical properties of high pressure metallic hydrogen (Miguel Borinaga - 5 July, 2017)

Our results show that atomic hydrogen displays an interband plasmon at around 6 eV that abruptly suppresses the reflectivity, while the large superconducting gap energy yields a sharp decrease of the reflectivity in the infrared region approximately at 120 meV

Tetrahedral $4Î±$ and $^{12}\textrm{C}+Î±$ cluster structures in $^{16}$O (Yoshiko Kanada-En&#39;yo - 25 May, 2017)
The formation of 4 $Î±$ clusters has been confirmed from nucleon degrees of freedom in the AMD model without assuming existence of any clusters. They form "tetrahedral" $4Î±$- and $^{12}\textrm{C}+Î±$-cluster structures. The $^{12}\textrm{C}+Î±$ structure constructs the $K^Ï=0^+$ band consisting of the $0^+_2$, $2^+_1$, and $4^+_1$ states and the $K^Ï=0^-$ band of the $1^-_2$, $3^-_2$, and $5^-_1$ states. The $0^+_1$, $3^-_1$, and $4^+_2$ states are assigned to the ground band constructed from the tetrahedral 4$Î±$ structure. Moreover, significant state mixing of the tetrahedral $4Î±$ and $^{12}\textrm{C}+Î±$ cluster structures occurs between $4^+_1$ and $4^+_2$ states, indicating that the $T_d$ configuration of $4Î±$ is rather fragile at $J^Ï=4^+$.

Pressure-induced metallization and superconducting phase in ReS2 (Dawei Zhou - 13 February, 2017)
The ambient pressure phase transforms to a "distorted-1T" structure at very low pressure and then to a tetragonal I41/amd structure at around 90 GPa. The "distorted-1T" structure undergoes a semiconductor-metal transition (SMT) at around 70 GPa with a band overlap mechanism. Electron-phonon calculations suggest that the I41/amd structure is superconducting and has a critical superconducting temperature of about 2 K at 100 GPa. We further perform high-pressure electrical resistance measurements up to 102 GPa

Structure and Magnetism in the Bond Frustrated Spinel, ZnCr2Se4 (P. Zajdel - 27 January, 2017)
Synchrotron X-ray diffraction shows a spin-lattice distortion from the cubic spinel to a tetragonal I41/amd lattice below TN = 21 K, where powder neutron diffraction confirms the formation of a helical magnetic structure with magnetic moment of 3.04(3) Î¼B at 1.5 K; close to that expected for high-spin Cr3+. MuSR measurements show prominent local spin correlations that are established at temperatures considerably higher (< 100 K) than the onset of long range magnetic order. Below TN, unusually fast (> 100 Î¼s-1) muon relaxation rates are suggestive of rapid site hopping of the muons in static field. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements show a gapless mode at an incommensurate propagation vector of k = (0 0 0.4648(2)) in the low temperature magnetic ordered phase that extends to 0.8 meV

Our results show that the ARM64 server's runtime performance is comparable to the x64 server for integer-based workloads like Sort and Hive queries, and only lags behind for floating-point intensive benchmarks like PageRank, when they do not exploit data parallelism adequately. We also see that the ARM64 server takes $\frac{1}{3}^{rd}$ the energy, and has an Energy Delay Product (EDP) that is $50-71\%$ lower than the x64 server

Crystal structure and anisotropic magnetic properties of new ferromagnetic Kondo lattice compound Ce(Cu,Al,Si)2 (A. Maurya - 11 September, 2016)
This compound is derived from the binary CeSi2 (tetragonal ThSi2-type, Pearson symbol tI12, space group I41/amd) obtained by partial substitution of Si by Cu and Al atoms but showing full occupation of the Si crystal site (8e). While CeSi2 is a well-known valence-fluctuating paramagnetic compound, the CeCu0.18Al0.24Si1.58 phase orders ferromagnetically at TC = 9.3 K. At low temperatures the easy-axis of magnetization is along the a-axis, which re-orients itself along the c-axis above 30 K. Analysis of the high temperature heat capacity data in the paramagnetic region lets us infer that the crystal electric field split doublet levels are located at 178 and 357 K, respectively, and Kondo temperature (8.4 K) is of the order of TC in CeCu0.18Al0.24Si1.58.

The thermal instability of the warm absorber in NGC 3783 (R. W. Goosmann - 4 March, 2016)
We model the observed X-ray spectral continuum shape, ionic column densities, and absorption measure distribution (AMD) of the warm absorber in the Seyfert galaxy NGC 3783. We compare the observational characteristics derived from the 900 ksec Chandra observation to radiative transfer computations in pressure equilibrium using the radiative transfer code TITAN. We find an extension of the degeneracy between xi and N_H0 for the constant pressure models previously discussed for NGC 3783. Including the ionic column densities of iron and neon in the comparison between observations and data we conclude that a range of ionization parameters between 4000 and 8000 ergs cm/s is preferred. For the first time, we present theoretical AMD for a constant pressure wind in NGC 3783 that correctly reproduces the observed level and is in approximate agreement with the observational appearance of an instability region.

A relative small coalescence radius R$_c =$ 2.5 fm is used for the phase space at $t =$ 500 fm/c to form the hot fragment. Two limitations on the impact parameter ($b1 = 0 - 2$ fm and $b2 = 0 - 9$ fm) are used to study the effect of central collisions in IBD. The IBD results for fragments with neutron-excess $I = $ 0 and 1 are obtained. \item[Conclusions] The IBDs for the $I =$ 0 and 1 chains are mainly determined by the central collisions, which reflects the nuclear density in the core region of the reaction system

Reconstructed primary fragments and symmetry energy, temperature and density of the fragmenting source in $^{64}$Zn + $^{112}$Sn at 40 MeV/nucleon (X. Liu - 14 October, 2014)

Structural change and phase coexistence upon magnetic ordering in the magnetodielectric spinel Mn$_3$O$_4$ (Moureen C. Kemei - 8 July, 2014)
Cooperative Jahn-Teller ordering is well-known to drive the cubic $Fd\overline{3}m$ to tetragonal $I$4$_1$/$amd$ structural distortion in Mn$_3$O$_4$ at 1170 $^{\circ}$C. Further structural distortion occurs in Mn$_3$O$_4$ upon magnetic ordering at 42 K. Employing high-resolution variable-temperature synchrotron x-ray diffraction we show that tetragonal $I$4$_1$/$amd$ and orthorhombic $Fddd$ phases coexist, with nearly equal fractions, below the NÃ©el temperature of Mn$_3$O$_4$. Structural phase coexistence in Mn$_3$O$_4$ is attributed to large strains due to the lattice mismatch between the tetragonal $I$4$_1$/$amd$ and the orthorhombic $Fddd$ phases. A comparison of the deformation observed in Mn$_3$O$_4$ to structural deformations of other magnetic spinels shows that phase coexistence may be a common theme when structural distortions occur below 50 K.

Structural distortion below the NÃ©el temperature in spinel GeCo$_2$O$_4$ (Phillip T. Barton - 27 May, 2014)
A structural phase transition from cubic $Fd\bar{3}m$ to tetragonal $I$4$_1$/$amd$ symmetry with $c/a >$ 1 is observed at $T_{\rm{S}}$ = 16 K in spinel GeCo$_2$O$_4$ below the NÃ©el temperature $T_N$ = 21 K. Structural and magnetic ordering appear to be decoupled with the structural distortion occurring at 16 K while magnetic order occurs at 21 K as determined by magnetic susceptibility and heat capacity measurements. We present the complete crystallographic description of GeCo$_2$O$_4$ in the tetragonal $I$4$_1$/$amd$ space group and discuss the possible origin of this distortion in the context of known structural transitions in magnetic spinels. Structural transitions were not detected in either compound down to $T \approx$ 8 K. Magnetometry experiments reveal in GeFe$_2$O$_4$ a second antiferromagnetic transition, with $T_{\rm{N1}}$ = 7.9 K and $T_{\rm{N2}}$ = 6.2 K, that was previously unknown, and that bear a similarity to the magnetism of GeNi$_2$O$_4$.

Experimental reconstruction of primary hot isotopes and characteristic properties of the fragmenting source in the heavy ion reactions near the Fermi energy (W. Lin - 14 September, 2014)
The reconstructed yield distributions are in good agreement with the primary isotope distributions obtained from AMD transport model simulations. The primary mass distributions exhibit a power law distribution with the critical exponent, $A^{-2.3}$, for $A \geq 15$ isotopes, but significantly deviates from that for the lighter isotopes. From this relation the density of the fragmenting source is determined to be $Ï/Ï_{0} = (0.63 \pm 0.03 )$. Using this density, the symmetry energy coefficient and the temperature of fragmenting source are determined in a self-consistent manner as $a_{sym} = (24.7 \pm 3.4) MeV$ and $T=(4.9 \pm 0.2)$ MeV.

Superdeformed $Î$ hypernuclei with antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (Masahiro Isaka - 29 January, 2014)
In the present study, we use the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) model. It is pointed out that many kinds of deformed bands appear in $^{45}$Sc and $^{47}$Sc. Especially, it is found that there exists superdeformed states in $^{45}$Sc.

A novel determination of density, temperature and symmetry energy for nuclear multi-fragmentation through primary fragment yield reconstruction (W. Lin - 17 February, 2014)
For the first time primary hot isotope distributions are experimentally reconstructed in intermediate heavy ion collisions and used with antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) calculations to determine density, temperature and symmetry energy coefficient in a self-consistent manner. A kinematical focusing method is employed to reconstruct the primary hot fragment yield distributions for multifragmentation events observed in the reaction system $^{64}$Zn + $^{112}$Sn at 40 MeV/nucleon. By comparison of the experimental values of $a_{sym}/T$ with those of calculations, the density of the source at fragment formation was determined to be $Ï/Ï_{0} = (0.63 \pm 0.03 )$. Using this density, the symmetry energy coefficient and the temperature are determined in a self-consistent manner as $a_{sym} = (24.7 \pm 1.9) MeV$ and $T=(4.9 \pm 0.2)$ MeV

Hybrid Functional Study Rationalizes the Simple Cubic Phase of Calcium at High Pressures (Hanyu Liu - 11 September, 2012)
However, recent density functional calculations within semi-local approximation showed that this SC phase is structurally unstable by exhibiting severely imaginary phonons, and is energetically unstable with respect to a theoretical body-centered tetragonal I41/amd structure over the pressure range of phase III. Our calculations were able to rationalize fundamentally the phase stability of SC structure over all other known phases by evidence of its actual energetic stability above 33 GPa and its intrinsically dynamical stability without showing any imaginary phonons in the entire pressure range studied. We further established that the long-thought theoretical I41/amd structure remains stable in a narrow pressure range before entering SC phase and is actually the structure of experimental Ca-III' synthesized recently at low temperature 14 K as supported by the excellent agreement between our simulated X-ray diffraction patterns and the experimental data

Hindrance of the excitation of the Hoyle state and the ghost of the $2^+_2$ state in $^{12}$C (Dao T. Khoa - 28 November, 2010)

Although AMD predicts a very weak transition strength for the direct $(0^+_1\to 2^+_2)$ excitation, our detailed analysis has shown evidence that a weak \emph{ghost} of the $2^+_2$ state could be identified in the 240 MeV \aap data for the $0^+_3$ state at 10.3 MeV, when the CC effects by the indirect excitation of the $2^+_2$ state are taken into account. Based on the same AMD structure input and preliminary \aap data at 386 MeV, we have estimated relative contributions from the $2^+_2$ and $0^+_3$ states to the excitation of $^{12}$C at $E_{\rm x}\approx 10$ MeV as well as possible contamination by $3^-_1$ state.

Exotic behavior and crystal structures of calcium under pressure (A. R. Oganov - 28 September, 2010)
The Î²-tin (I41/amd) structure, rather than simple cubic, is predicted to be the theoretical ground state at 0 K and 33-71 GPa. This structure can be represented as a large distortion of the simple cubic structure, just as the higher-pressure phases stable between 71 and 134 GPa. The structure of Ca-V, stable above 134 GPa, is a complex host-guest structure. According to our calculations, the predicted phases are superconductors with Tc increasing under pressure and reaching ~20 K at 120 GPa, in good agreement with experiment.

X-Ray Absorption Analysis of MCG-6-30-15: Discerning Three Kinematic Systems (Tomer Holczer - 13 October, 2009)
The slow outflow at -100 +/- 50 km s^-1 has a large range of ionization manifested by absorption from 24 different charge states of Fe, which enables a detailed reconstruction of the absorption measure distribution (AMD). This AMD spans five orders of magnitude in ionization parameter: -1.5 < log xi < 3.5 (cgs units), with a total column density of N_H = (5.3 +/- 0.7) x 10^21 cm^-2. The fast outflow at -1900 +/- 150 km s^-1 has a well defined ionization parameter with log xi = 3.82 +/- 0.03 (cgs units) and column density N_H = 8.1 +/- 0.7 x 10^22 cm^-2. Assuming this component is a thin, uniform, spherical shell, it can be estimated to lie within 11 light days of the \agn center. The third component, most clearly detected in the lower oxygen charge states O^+1 - O^+6, has been confused in the past with the fast outflow, but is identified here with local gas z = 0 and a total column density N_H of a few 10^20 cm^-2

Quadrupole Deformation $Î²$ and $Î³$ Constraint in a Framework of Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics (Tadahiro Suhara - 5 March, 2010)
We propose a new method of the $Î²$-$Î³$ constraint for quadrupole deformation in antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) to describe various cluster and shell-model structures in the ground and excited states of light nuclei. We apply this method to N=6 isotones, $^{10}$Be, $^{12}$C, $^{9}$Li, and $^{11}$B, and find various structures as functions of the deformation parameters, $Î²$ and $Î³$. For $^{10}$Be and $^{12}$C, we superpose the basis AMD wave functions obtained by the $Î²$-$Î³$ constraint method to calculate energy spectra, and prove the advantages of the present method of the two-dimensional $Î²$-$Î³$ constraint in the framework of AMD.

Density Profiles in Seyfert Outflows (Ehud Behar - 4 August, 2009)
More quantitatively, a power-law fit for log AMD ~ (log xi)^a yields slopes of 0 < a < 0.4. If the wind is distributed on large scales, the measured slopes imply a generic density radial profile of n ~ r^{-alpha} with 1 < alpha < 1.3. This scaling rules out a mass conserving radial flow of n ~ r^{-2}, or a constant density absorber, but is consistent with a non-spherical MHD outflow model in which n ~ r^{-1} along any given line of sight. as in the turbulent interstellar medium (ISM), the AMD slopes imply density scaling of n ~ delta r^{-alpha} with 0.7 < alpha < 1.0, which is quite different from the scaling of approximately n ~ delta r^{0.4} found in the Milky Way ISM and typical of incompressible turbulence.

It was also found that the normal-deformed and superdeformed bands have a non-negligible $Î±$-$^{36}$Ar cluster component and $^{12}$C-$^{28}$Si cluster component, respectively.

The neutron structure of the $K^Ï=3/2^-$ is analogous to the intruder ground state of $^{12}$Be. The band-head $1/2^+$ state is assigned to the $1/2^+$(4.83 MeV), which was experimentally suggested to be the proton intruder state because of the strong production via the proton-transfer to the $^{12}$Be($0^+$) state in the $^4$He($^{12}$Be,$^{13}$B$Î³$)$X$ experiments.

Furthermore the reproduction of data in the large angle region $Î¸\agt 120^\circ$ for $E_{p'}$ = 100 MeV is shown to be due to three-step contributions.

High-momentum antisymmetrized molecular dynamics compared with tensor-optimized shell model for strong tensor correlation (Takayuki Myo - 3 January, 2018)

This indicates that in HM-AMD the high-momentum components described by the imaginary centroid vectors of the nucleon pair provide the equivalent effect of the 2p-2h excitations for the tensor correlation.

Isocaling and the Symmetry Energy in the Multifragmentation Regime of Heavy Ion Collisions (Z. Chen - 1 February, 2010)
The extracted values have been compared to the results of calculations made with an Antisymmetrized Molecular Dynamics (AMD) model employing a statistical decay code to account for deexcitation of excited primary fragments. The experimental values are in good agreement with the values calculated but are significantly different from those characterizing the yields of the primary AMD fragments.

MHD Accretion-Disk Winds as X-ray Absorbers in AGNs (Keigo Fukumura - 9 April, 2010)
For n(r)~1/r the AMD is found to be independent of Î¾, in good agreement with its behavior inferred from the X-ray spectra of several AGNs. We indicate that a combination of the AMD and absorption line profile observations can uniquely determine these model parameters and their bearing on AGN population demographics.

Comparison of dynamical multifragmentation models (J. Rizzo - 19 September, 2006)
to mean-field instabilities, in AMD many-body correlations have a stronger impact on the fragmentation dynamics and clusters start to appear at earlier times. As a consequence, fragments are formed on shorter time scales in AMD, on about equal footing of light particle pre-equilibrium emission

Multifragmentation and Symmetry Energy Studied with AMD (Akira Ono - 2 May, 2006)
The antisymmetrized molecular dynamics (AMD) simulations suggest that the isospin composition of fragments produced dynamically in multifragmentation reactions is basically governed by the symmetry energy of low-density uniform nuclear matter rather than the symmetry energy for the ground-state finite nuclei

$2Î±+t$ cluster structure in $^{11}$B (T. Kawabata - 28 September, 2006)
The excitation strengths are compared with the predictions by the shell-model and antisymmetrized molecular-dynamics (AMD) calculations. It is found that the large monopole strength for the $3/2^-_3$ state at $E_x=8.56$ MeV is well described by the AMD calculation and is an evidence for a developed $2Î±+t$ cluster structure.

Calculating the deuteron, triton and $^4$He with the extended version of AMD, we obtained solutions that have large contribution of the tensor force

The applicability region of AMD is discussed, in particular, in the cases of systems with discrete spectrum, and a relation between the classical AMD trajectories and the quantum distributions is established

Statistical properties of antisymmetrized molecular dynamics for non-nucleon-emission and nucleon-emission processes (Akira Ono - 1 November, 1995)
We then explain that the statistical properties of AMD for nucleon emission processes are classical because nucleon emission processes in AMD are described by the motion of wave packet centroids. When we improve the description of the nucleon emission process so as to take into account the momentum fluctuation due to the wave packet spread, the AMD statistical properties for nucleon emission processes change drastically into quantum statistics
