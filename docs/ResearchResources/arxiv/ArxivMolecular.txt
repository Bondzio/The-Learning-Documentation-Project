Biological Optical-to-Chemical Signal Conversion Interface: A Small-scale Modulator for Molecular Communications (Laura Grebenstein - 14 August, 2018)

SIMD Vectorization for the Lennard-Jones Potential with AVX2 and AVX-512 instructions (Hiroshi Watanabe - 13 June, 2018)

The performance gains by vectorization are about 42\% on HSW compared with the code optimized without vectorization.

RPYFMM: Parallel Adaptive Fast Multipole Method for Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa Tensor in Biomolecular Hydrodynamics Simulations (W. Guan - 8 November, 2017)
RPYFMM is a software package for the efficient evaluation of the potential field governed by the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) tensor interactions in biomolecular hydrodynamics simulations. In our algorithm, the RPY tensor is decomposed as a linear combination of four Laplace interactions, each of which is evaluated using the adaptive fast multipole method (FMM) [1] where the exponential expansions are applied to diagonalize the multipole-to-local translation operators. RPYFMM offers a unified execution on both shared and distributed memory computers by leveraging the DASHMM library [2, 3]. Preliminary numerical results show that the interactions for a molecular system of 15 million particles (beads) can be computed within one second on a Cray XC30 cluster using 12, 288 cores, while achieving approximately 54% strong-scaling efficiency.

On structural properties of trees with minimal atom-bond connectivity index IV: Solving a conjecture about the pendent paths of length three (Darko Dimitrov - 26 June, 2017)
The atom-bond connectivity (ABC) index is one of the most investigated degree-based molecular structure descriptors with a variety of chemical applications. By now, one of the proved properties is that a tree with a minimal ABC index may have, at most, one pendent path of length $3$, with the conjecture that it cannot be a case if the order of a tree is larger than $1178$. Here, we provide an affirmative answer of a strengthened version of that conjecture, showing that a tree with minimal ABC index cannot contain a pendent path of length $3$ if its order is larger than $415$.

The correlation coefficient R2 on the test set was improved from 0.56 to 0.66 when using SMILES enumeration, and the root mean square error (RMS) likewise fell from 0.62 to 0.55. By taking the average per molecule of the predictions for the enumerated SMILES a further improvement to a correlation coefficient of 0.68 and a RMS of 0.52 was found.

Bias Correction in Saupe Tensor Estimation (Yuehaw Khoo - 22 June, 2016)
Estimation of the Saupe tensor is central to the determination of molecular structures from residual dipolar couplings (RDC) or chemical shift anisotropies. 1999 has been used traditionally to estimate the Saupe tensor. For both synthetic and experimental RDC datasets of ubiquitin, when using template fragments corrupted by large noise, the magnitude of our proposed bias-reduced estimator generally reaches at least 90% of the actual value, whereas the magnitude of SVD estimator can be shrunk below 80% of the true value.

It is also very easy to 'hack' the program so it can compute intermolecular radial distribution functions for groups of interaction sites rather than whole molecules.

Queuing models for abstracting interactions in Bacterial communities (NicolÃ² Michelusi - 10 January, 2016)
Microbial communities play a significant role in bioremediation,plant growth,human and animal digestion,global elemental cycles including the carbon-cycle,and water treatment.They are also posed to be the engines of renewable energy via microbial fuel cells which can reverse the process of electrosynthesis.Microbial communication regulates many virulence mechanisms used by bacteria.Thus,it is of fundamental importance to understand interactions in microbial communities and to develop predictive tools that help control them,in order to aid the design of systems exploiting bacterial capabilities.This position paper explores how abstractions from communications,networking and information theory can play a role in understanding and modeling bacterial interactions.In particular,two forms of interactions in bacterial systems will be examined:electron transfer and quorum sensing.While the diffusion of chemical signals has been heavily studied,electron transfer occurring in living cells and its role in cell-cell interaction is less understood.Recent experimental observations open up new frontiers in the design of microbial systems based on electron transfer,which may coexist with the more well-known interaction strategies based on molecular diffusion.In quorum sensing,the concentration of certain signature chemical compounds emitted by the bacteria is used to estimate the bacterial population size,so as to activate collective behaviors.In this position paper,queuing models for electron transfer are summarized and adapted to provide new models for quorum sensing.These models are stochastic,and thus capture the inherent randomness exhibited by cell colonies in nature.It is shown that queuing models allow the characterization of the state of a single cell as a function of interactions with other cells and the environment,while being amenable to complexity reduction.
