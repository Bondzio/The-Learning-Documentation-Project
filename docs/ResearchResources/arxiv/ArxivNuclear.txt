Tuning for Tissue Image Segmentation Workflows for Accuracy and Performance (Luis F. R. Taveira - 5 October, 2018)
Our software platform adjusts the parameters of a nuclear segmentation algorithm to maximize the quality of image segmentation results while minimizing the execution time. Our results using three real-world image segmentation workflows demonstrate that the proposed solution is able to (1) search a small fraction (about 100 points) of the parameter space, which contains billions to trillions of points, and improve the quality of segmentation output by 1.20x, 1.29x, and 1.29x, on average; (2) decrease the execution time of a segmentation workflow by up to 11.79x while improving output quality; and (3) effectively use parallel systems to accelerate parameter tuning and segmentation phases.

Tensor Robust Principal Component Analysis: Exact Recovery of Corrupted Low-Rank Tensors via Convex Optimization (Canyi Lu - 26 May, 2018)

Tight oracle bounds for low-rank matrix recovery from a minimal number of random measurements (Emmanuel J. Candes - 2 January, 2010)
We show that properly constrained nuclear-norm minimization stably recovers a low-rank matrix from a constant number of noisy measurements per degree of freedom; this seems to be the first result of this nature. Further, the recovery error from noisy data is within a constant of three targets: 1) the minimax risk, 2) an oracle error that would be available if the column space of the matrix were known, and 3) a more adaptive oracle error which would be available with the knowledge of the column space corresponding to the part of the matrix that stands above the noise. The analysis in this paper is based on the restricted isometry property (RIP) introduced in [6] for vectors, and in [22] for matrices.

The extensive experimental results on synthetic data and real-world data demonstrate the superior high performance and efficiency of the proposed approach against the state-of-the-art algorithms.

Analyzing the Weighted Nuclear Norm Minimization and Nuclear Norm Minimization based on Group Sparse Representation (Zhiyuan Zha - 18 July, 2018)
To rectify the weakness of NNM, recent advances have shown that weighted nuclear norm minimization (WNNM) can achieve a better matrix rank approximation than NNM, which heuristically set the weight being inverse to the singular values. Experimental results demonstrate that WNNM is more feasible than NNM and the proposed scheme outperforms many current state-of-the-art methods.

Augmented L1 and Nuclear-Norm Models with a Globally Linearly Convergent Algorithm (Ming-Jun Lai - 13 March, 2013)
This paper studies the long-existing idea of adding a nice smooth function to "smooth" a non-differentiable objective function in the context of sparse optimization, in particular, the minimization of $||x||_1+1/(2Î±)||x||_2^2$, where $x$ is a vector, as well as the minimization of $||X||_*+1/(2Î±)||X||_F^2$, where $X$ is a matrix and $||X||_*$ and $||X||_F$ are the nuclear and Frobenius norms of $X$, respectively

A Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Implementation of a Classical Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm (Alastair A. Abbott - 2 October, 2011)

In this paper we describe experiments in which we take the contrasting approach of using NMR as a classical computing medium, treating the nuclear spin vectors classically and utilising an alternative embedding of bits into the physical medium

Solving Principal Component Pursuit in Linear Time via $l_1$ Filtering (Risheng Liu - 6 May, 2012)
It is the first algorithm that can \emph{exactly} solve a nuclear norm minimization problem in \emph{linear time} (with respect to the data size). Experiments on both synthetic data and real applications testify to the great advantage of $l_1$ filtering in speed over state-of-the-art algorithms.

Interference Alignment as a Rank Constrained Rank Minimization (Dimitris S. Papailiopoulos - 16 March, 2011)
Then, we present a convex relaxation of the RCRM problem inspired by recent results in compressed sensing and low-rank matrix completion theory that rely on approximating rank with the nuclear norm. We show that the convex envelope of the sum of ranks of the interference matrices is the normalized sum of their corresponding nuclear norms and introduce tractable constraints that are asymptotically equivalent to the rank constraints for the initial problem

Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the L1 norm
