hep-th (Yang-Hui He - 27 June, 2018)
We apply techniques in natural language processing, computational linguistics, and machine-learning to investigate papers in hep-th and four related sections of the arXiv: hep-ph, hep-lat, gr-qc, and math-ph. All of the titles of papers in each of these sections, from the inception of the arXiv until the end of 2017, are extracted and treated as a corpus which we use to train the neural network Word2Vec. In conjunction with support vector machines, we also show that the syntactic structure of the titles in different sub-fields of high energy and mathematical physics are sufficiently different that a neural network can perform a binary classification of formal versus phenomenological sections with 87.1% accuracy, and can perform a finer five-fold classification across all sections with 65.1% accuracy.

Gender Prediction in English-Hindi Code-Mixed Social Media Content : Corpus and Baseline System (Ankush Khandelwal - 14 June, 2018)
Author profiling is the problem of automatically determining profiling aspects like the author's gender and age group through a text is gaining much popularity in computational linguistics. However many users often change the language while posting on social media which is called code-mixing, and it develops some challenges in the field of text classification and author profiling like variations in spelling, non-grammatical structure and transliteration \cite{3}. There are very few English-Hindi code-mixed annotated datasets of social media content present online \cite{4}

Modeling Source Syntax for Neural Machine Translation (Junhui Li - 2 May, 2017)
Even though a linguistics-free sequence to sequence model in neural machine translation (NMT) has certain capability of implicitly learning syntactic information of source sentences, this paper shows that source syntax can be explicitly incorporated into NMT effectively to provide further improvements. On the basis, we propose three different sorts of encoders to incorporate source syntax into NMT: 1) Parallel RNN encoder that learns word and label annotation vectors parallelly; 2) Hierarchical RNN encoder that learns word and label annotation vectors in a two-level hierarchy; and 3) Mixed RNN encoder that stitchingly learns word and label annotation vectors over sequences where words and labels are mixed. It is interesting to note that the simplest RNN encoder, i.e., Mixed RNN encoder yields the best performance with an significant improvement of 1.4 BLEU points

Ordering information on distributions (John van de Wetering - 23 January, 2017)
Some links to domain theory and computational linguistics are also discussed. Chapter 1 details some useful theorems from order theory. In Chapter 2 we define a notion of an information ordering on the space of probability distributions and see that this gives rise to a large class of orderings. In Chapter 3 we extend the idea of an information ordering to the space of density operators and in particular look at the maximum eigenvalue order. In Chapter 4 we discuss a possible application in distributional language models, namely in the study of entailment and disambiguation.

Deconvolution-Based Global Decoding for Neural Machine Translation (Junyang Lin - 10 June, 2018)
As the studies of linguistics have proved that language is not linear word sequence but sequence of complex structure, translation at each step should be conditioned on the whole target-side context. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is more competitive compared with the state-of-the-art methods, and the analysis reflects that our model is also robust to translating sentences of different lengths and it also reduces repetition with the instruction from the target-side context for decoding.

Statistical Patterns in Written Language (DamiÃ¡n H. Zanette - 23 August, 2017)
Quantitative linguistics has been allowed, in the last few decades, within the admittedly blurry boundaries of the field of complex systems. Overall, results can still be categorized as modest, but the prospects are promising: medium- and long-range features in the organization of human language -which are beyond the scope of traditional linguistics- have already emerged from this kind of analysis and continue to be reported, contributing a new perspective to our understanding of this most complex communication system
