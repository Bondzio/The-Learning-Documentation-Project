CoverBLIP: accelerated and scalable iterative matched-filtering for Magnetic Resonance Fingerprint reconstruction (Mohammad Golbabaee - 3 October, 2018)
We address this shortcoming by arranging dictionary atoms in the form of cover tree structures and adopt the corresponding fast approximate nearest neighbour searches to accelerate matched-filtering. Our further examinations on both synthetic and real-world datasets and using different sampling strategies, indicates between 2 to 3 orders of magnitude reduction in total search computations

Domain Aware Markov Logic Networks (Happy Mittal - 7 July, 2018)

Perspectival Knowledge in PSOA RuleML: Representation, Model Theory, and Translation (Harold Boley - 1 May, 2018)
This perspectivity dimension refines the space between oidless, positional atoms (relationships) and oidful, slotted atoms (frames): While relationships use only a predicate-scope-sensitive (predicate-dependent) tuple and frames use only predicate-scope-insensitive (predicate-independent) slots, PSOA RuleML 1.0 uses a systematics of orthogonal constructs also permitting atoms with (predicate-)independent tuples and atoms with (predicate-)dependent slots. The presentation and (XML-)serialization syntaxes of PSOA RuleML 1.0 are introduced.

Cent percent accuracy has been obtained using moving SDR accumulated over six successive frames for ten of the audio sources tested, while the two other sources require accumulation of 10 and 14 frames.

Moreover, we present another bound for gOMP of order $NK+1$ with $Î´_{NK+1} < \frac {\sqrt{N}}{\sqrt{K}+\sqrt{N}}$ which exactly relates to the near optimal bound of $Î´_{K+1} < \frac {1}{\sqrt{K}+1}$ for OMP (N=1) as shown in \cite{wang_2012a}.

In the proposed algorithm, every dictionary atom is automatically aligned with the input image and the sparse code is then recovered using the adapted dictionary atoms

A role-free approach to indexing large RDF data sets in secondary memory for efficient SPARQL evaluation (George H. L. Fletcher - 7 November, 2008)
The novelty of TripleT is that (1) the index is built over the atoms occurring in the data set, rather than at a coarser granularity, such as whole triples occurring in the data set; and (2) the atoms are indexed regardless of the roles (i.e., subjects, predicates, or objects) they play in the triples of the data set. We show through extensive empirical evaluation that TripleT exhibits multiple orders of magnitude improvement over the state of the art on RDF indexing, in terms of both storage and query processing costs.

Linear Logic by Levels and Bounded Time Complexity (Patrick Baillot - 26 July, 2009)

A Common View on Strong, Uniform, and Other Notions of Equivalence in Answer-Set Programming (Stefan Woltran - 6 December, 2007)
Notions in between strong and ordinary equivalence have been introduced as theoretical tools to compare incomplete programs and are defined by either restricting the syntactic structure of the considered context programs R or by bounding the set A of atoms allowed to occur in R (relativized equivalence).For the latter approach, different A yield properly different equivalence notions, in general. In this paper, we propose a parameterization for equivalence notions which takes care of both such kinds of restrictions simultaneously by bounding, on the one hand, the atoms which are allowed to occur in the rule heads of the context and, on the other hand, the atoms which are allowed to occur in the rule bodies of the context

Logic programs with monotone abstract constraint atoms (V. W. Marek - 25 August, 2006)
We show that the operational concept of the one-step provability operator generalizes to programs with monotone constraint atoms, but the generalization involves nondeterminism. Our main results demonstrate that our formalism is a common generalization of (1) normal logic programming with its semantics of models, supported models and stable models, (2) logic programming with weight atoms (lparse programs) with the semantics of stable models, as defined by Niemela, Simons and Soininen, and (3) of disjunctive logic programming with the possible-model semantics of Sakama and Inoue.
