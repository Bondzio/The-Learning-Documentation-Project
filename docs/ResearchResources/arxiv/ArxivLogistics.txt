PPtaxi: Non-stop Package Delivery via Multi-hop Ridesharing (Yueyue Chen - 12 September, 2018)
It places a tremendous burden on the traditional logistics industry, which relies on dedicated couriers and is labor-intensive. The results show that the successful delivery rate of packages with our solution can reach $95\%$ on average during the daytime, and is at most $46.9\%$ higher than those of the benchmarks.

Critically fast pick-and-place with suction cups (Hung Pham - 10 September, 2018)
Fast robotic pick-and-place with suction cups is a crucial component in the current development of automation in logistics (factory lines, e-commerce, etc.) By "critically fast" we mean the fastest possible movements for transporting an object such that it does not slip or fall from the suction cup. We experimentally validate the proposed pipeline on a physical robot system: the cycle time for a typical pick-and-place task was less than 5 seconds, planning and execution times included

CrowdExpress: A Probabilistic Framework for On-Time Crowdsourced Package Deliveries (Chao Chen - 8 September, 2018)

Results show that around 9,500 packages can be delivered successfully on time per day with the success rate over 94%, moreover, the average computation time is within 25 milliseconds.

Detection, localisation and tracking of pallets using machine learning techniques and 2D range data (Ihab S. Mohamed - 29 March, 2018)
The problem of autonomous transportation in industrial scenarios is receiving a renewed interest due to the way it can revolutionise internal logistics, especially in unstructured environments. For fine-tuning the CNNs, the architecture has been systematically evaluated using a real-world dataset containing 340 labeled 2D scans, which have been made freely available in an online repository. Detection performance has been assessed on the basis of the average accuracy over k-fold cross-validation, and it scored 99.58% in our tests

The Electric Two-echelon Vehicle Routing Problem (Ulrich Breunig - 15 July, 2018)
Route planning in multi-tier logistics leads to notoriously difficult problems. In particular, we observe that the detour miles due to recharging decrease proportionally to $1/Ï^x$ with $x \approx 5/4$ as a function of the charging stations density $Ï$; e.g., in a scenario where the density of charging stations is doubled, recharging detours are reduced by 58\%

The Parameterized Hardness of the k-Center Problem in Transportation Networks (Andreas Emil Feldmann - 5 June, 2018)

Better Data Visibility & Data Use Result in Lower Cost and Improved Performance in Medicine Supply Chains (Marasi Mwencha - 27 September, 2016)
These upgrades include the establishment of a national electronic logistics management information system (eLMIS) and the introduction of a Logistics Management Unit (LMU) to use the eLMIS for managing all key public health commodities. The quantitative analysis found that stock out rates for all product goods dropped from 32% to 23%, with the frequency of stock-outs greater than 7 days dropping from 24% to 15%. Performance improved from the 2014 baseline findings of 68% to 77%, but cost per value of commodities adjusted for performance decreased from 58% at baseline to 50% in year 1.

Practical Linear Value-approximation Techniques for First-order MDPs (Scott Sanner - 27 June, 2012)

(2) Can we automatically generate basis functions and evaluate their impact on value function quality? (3) How can we decompose intractable problems with universally quantified rewards into tractable subproblems? We propose answers to these questions along with a number of novel optimizations and provide a comparative empirical evaluation on logistics problems from the ICAPS 2004 Probabilistic Planning Competition.

Network Topology and Time Criticality Effects in the Modularised Fleet Mix Problem (James M. Whitacre - 3 July, 2009)
In this paper, we explore the interplay between network topology and time criticality in a military logistics system. The particular focus of this paper is to gain a better understanding of how the logistics environment changes when current Army vehicles with fixed transport characteristics are replaced by a new generation of modularised vehicles that can be configured task-specifically
