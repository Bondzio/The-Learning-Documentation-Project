Scraping SERPs for Archival Seeds: It Matters When You Start (Alexander C. Nwala - 25 May, 2018)
The queries represent public interest stories: "healthcare bill," "manchester bombing," "london terrorism," "trump russia," "travel ban," "hurricane harvey," and "hurricane irma." We tracked each URI in all collections over time to estimate the discoverability of URIs from the first five SERPs. Our results showed that the daily average rate at which stories were replaced on the default Google SERP ranged from 0.21 -0.54, and a weekly rate of 0.39 - 0.79, suggesting the fast replacement of older stories by newer stories. The probability of finding the same URI of a news story after one day from the initial appearance on the SERP ranged from 0.34 - 0.44. After a week, the probability of finding the same news stories diminishes rapidly to 0.01 - 0.11

Annama H chondrite - mineralogy, physical properties, cosmic ray exposure, and parent body history (TomÃ¡Å¡ Kohout - 20 October, 2017)
The fall of the Annama meteorite occurred early morning (local time) on April 19, 2014 on the Kola Peninsula (Russia). It has a high Ar-Ar age of 4.4 Ga. Its cosmic ray exposure history is atypical as it is not part of the large group of H chondrites with a prominent 7 - 8 Ma peak in the exposure age histograms. Instead, its exposure age is within uncertainty of a smaller peak at 30 \pm 4 Ma. The results from short-lived radionuclides are compatible with an atmosperic pre-entry radius of 30 - 40 cm. However, based on noble gas and cosmogenic radionuclide data, Annama must have been part of a larger body (radius >65 cm) for a large part of its cosmic ray exposure history. The 10Be concentration indicates a recent (3 - 5 Ma) breakup which may be responsible for the Annama parent body size reduction to 30 - 35 cm pre-entry radius.

The Geometry of Large Tundra Lakes Observed in Historical Maps and Satellite Images (Ivan Sudakov - 23 October, 2017)
In this paper, we aim to analyze the geometry of the patterns formed by large ($>0.8$ km$^2$) tundra lakes in the Russian High Arctic. We have studied images of tundra lakes in historical maps from the State Hydrological Institute, Russia (date 1977; scale $0.21166$ km/pixel) and in Landsat satellite images derived from the Google Earth Engine (G.E.E.; date 2016; scale $0.1503$ km/pixel). For lakes observed in historical maps, this bifurcation occurs among lakes larger than $100$ km$^2$ (fractal dimension $1.43$ to $1.87$). For lakes observed in satellite images this bifurcation occurs among lakes larger than $\sim$100 km$^2$ (fractal dimension $1.31$ to $1.95$). Tundra lakes with a fractal dimension close to $2$ have a tendency to be self-similar with respect to their area--perimeter relationships. Area--perimeter measurements indicate that lakes with a length scale greater than $70$ km$^2$ are power-law distributed

Chromium isotope evidence in ejecta deposits for the nature of Paleoproterozoic impactors (Berengere Mougel - 20 December, 2016)
Paleoproterozoic spherule layers from Greenland (Graenseso) and Russia (Zaonega), as well as some distal ejecta deposits (Lake Superior region) from the Sudbury impact (1,849 +/- 0.3 Ma) event, have been analyzed for their Cr isotope compositions. Our results suggest that 1) these distal ejecta deposits are all of impact origin, 2) the Graenseso and Zaonega spherule layers contain a distinct carbonaceous chondrite component, and are possibly related to the same impact event, which could be Vredefort (2,023 +/- 4 Ma) or another not yet identified large impact event from that of similar age, and 3) the Sudbury ejecta record a complex meteoritic signature, which is different from the Graenseso and Zaonega spherule layers, and could indicate the impact of a heterogeneous chondritic body.

This range covers the linear polarization maximum near 90 degrees and large-angle slope of the curve which are most sensitive to the particle size. Results are compared with T-matrix simulations for different sizes and shapes of ice particles, the best-fit model radius of particles (0.06 microns) and maximum radius (about 0.1 microns) are estimated.

Is It Possible to Predict Strong Earthquakes? (Yuriy S. Polyakov - 4 July, 2014)

The rodent brain activity signals are selected as potential "immediate" (up to 2 weeks) deterministic precursors due to the recent scientific reports confirming that rodents sense imminent earthquakes and the population-genetic model of Kirshvink (2000) showing how a reliable genetic seismic escape response system may have developed over the period of several hundred million years in certain animals

Creation of electron-positron plasma with superstrong laser field (N. B. Narozhny - 17 December, 2013)

Realization of these projects will make available a laser of intensity $\sim 10^{26}$W/cm$^2$ or even higher. We show that, in spite of the fact that the respective field strength is still essentially less than $E_S=m^2c^3/e\hbar=1.32\cdot 10^{16}$V/cm, the nonlinear vacuum effects will be accessible for observation at ELI and XCELS facilities. It is shown, that at intensities $\sim 5\cdot 10^{25}$W/cm$^2$, creation even of a single pair is accompanied by development of an avalanchelike QED cascade

A Comparison of the Red and Green Coronal Line Intensities at the 29 March 2006 and the 1 August 2008 Total Solar Eclipses: Considerations of the Temperature of the Solar Corona (A. Voulgaris - 4 June, 2010)
During the total solar eclipse at Akademgorodok, Siberia, Russia, in 1 August 2008, we imaged the flash spectrum with a slitless spectrograph. We have spectroscopically determined the duration of totality, the epoch of the 2nd and 3rd contacts and the duration of the flash spectrum (63 s during ingress and 48 s during egress). Here we compare the 2008 flash spectra with those that we similarly obtained from the total solar eclipse of 29 March 2006, at Kastellorizo, Greece. The results show that the high-ionization state, the [Fe XIV] emission line, was much weaker during the 2008 eclipse, indicating that following the long, inactive period during the solar minimum, there was a drop in the overall temperature of the solar corona.

The 2008 August 1 Eclipse Solar-Minimum Corona Unraveled (Jay M. Pasachoff - 9 July, 2009)
We discuss results stemming from observations of the white-light and [Fe XIV] emission corona during the total eclipse of the Sun of 2008 August 1, in Mongolia (Altaj region) and in Russia (Akademgorodok, Novosibirsk, Siberia). Corresponding to the current extreme solar minimum, the white-light corona, visible up to 20 solar radii, was of a transient type with well-pronounced helmet streamers situated above a chain of prominences at position angles 48, 130, 241 and 322 degrees. Furthering an original method of image processing, stars up to 12 magnitude, a Kreutz-group comet (C/2008 O1), and a coronal mass ejection (CME) were also detected, with the smallest resolvable structures being of, and at some places even less than, 1 arcsec. In addition to the high-resolution coronal images, which show the continuum corona (K-corona) that results from electron scattering of photospheric light, images of the overlapping green-emission-line (530.3 nm, [Fe XIV]) corona were obtained with the help of two narrow-passband filters (centered on the line itself and for the continuum in the vicinity of 529.1 nm, respectively), each with FWHM of 0.15 nm

Interference filter images and spectral data were taken in March 2005 with the f/7.7 1.5 m Russian Turkish Telescope (RTT150) at TUBITAK National Observatory (TUG). Spectral data were obtained with the 6 m BTA (Bolshoi Azimuthal Telescope, Russia). Five SNR candidates were identified in NGC 2903 with [SII]/H$Î±$ ratios ranging from 0.41 - 0.74 and H$Î±$ intensities ranging from 9.4$\times10^{-15}$ to 1.7$\times10^{-14}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. This work represents the first identification of SNRs by an optical survey in NGC 2903.

The overburden of the under ground experimental halls, connected with tunnels, ranges from about 250 to 900 meters-water-equivalent so that the cosmogenic background is small compared to the number of observed antineutrino events. Civil construction of tunnels and experimental facilities is planned to start in 2007, with detector construction beginning in 2008. The experiment will begin collecting data in 2010. By comparing the detected signals at the three locations, with three years of data, a sensitivity in sin**2(2theta_13) of better than 0.01 is expected.

Investigation of flat spectrum radio sources by the interplanetary scintillation method at 111 MHz (S. A. Tyul&#39;bashev - 12 July, 2005)
(1998) flat spectrum radio sources were carried out at 111 MHz using the interplanetary scintillation method on the Large Phased Array (LPA) in Russia. Due to the large size of the LPA beam ($1\degr \times 0.5\degr$) a careful inspection of all possible confusion sources was made using extant large radio surveys: 37 of the 48 sources are not confused. We were able to estimate the scintillating flux densities of 13 sources, getting upper limits for the remaining 35. This proof-of-concept project tells us that compact ($<1''$) flat spectrum radio sources show strong enough scintillations at 111 MHz to establish/constrain their spectra (low-frequency end).

A beam line for electrons with energies in the range of 1 to 45 GeV, low contamination of hadrons and muons and high intensity up to 10^6 per accelerator spill at 27 GeV was setup at U70 accelerator in Protvino, Russia. A beam tagging system based on drift chambers with 160 micron resolution was able to measure relative electron beam momentum precisely. The resolution sigma_p p was 0.13% at 45 GeV where multiple scattering is negligible

Age and metallicity of a globular cluster in the dwarf spheroidal galaxy DDO78 (M. E. Sharina - 23 August, 2002)
The DDO78 globular cluster, 4 Milky Way globular clusters, spectroscopic and radial velocity standards were observed with the Long-slit spectrograph of the 6-m telescope (SAO RAS, Russia). We have derived the mean metallicity of the globular cluster in DDO78 to be [Fe/H] = -1.6 +- 0.1 dex by taking the weighted mean of metallicities obtained from the strength of several absorption features

The Hamburg/SAO Survey for Emission--Line Galaxies. V. The Fifth List of 161 Galaxies (A. V. Ugryumov - 11 June, 2001)
We present the fifth list with results of the Hamburg/SAO Survey for Emission-Line Galaxies (HSS therein, SAO -- Special Astrophysical Observatory, Russia). The list is a result of follow-up spectroscopy conducted with the 2.2m CAHA and 4m Kitt Peak telescopes in 1999. The data of this snap-shot spectroscopy survey confirmed 166 emission-line objects out of 209 observed candidates and allowed their quantitative spectral classification and redshift determination. We could classify 98 emission-line objects as BCG/HII galaxies or probable BCGs, 5 -- as QSOs, 3 - as Seyfert galaxies, 2 - as super-associations in subluminous spiral galaxies. 25 low-excitation objects were classified as starburst nuclei (SBN), 24 as dwarf amorphous nuclei starburst galaxies (DANS) and 3 as LINERs. Due to low signal-to-noise ratio we could not classify 6 ELGs. Furthermore, for another 4 galaxies we did not detect any significant emission lines. For 131 emission-line galaxies, the redshifts and/or line intensities are determined for the first time. For the remaining 30 previously known ELGs we give either improved data of the line intensities or some independent measurements.

Radio and optical observations of large-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances during a strong geomagnetic storm of 6-8 April 2000 (E. L. Afraimovich - 23 April, 2001)
Total electron content (TEC) variations were studied by using data from GPS receivers located in Russia and Central Asia. The nightglow response to this storm at mesopause and termospheric altitudes was also measured by optical instruments FENIX located at the observatory of the Institute of Solar-Terrestrial Physics, (51.9 deg. N, 103.0 deg. E) and MORTI located at the observatory of the Institute of Ionosphere (43.2 deg. N, 77.0 deg. Observations of the O (557.7 nm, 630.0 nm, 360-410 nm, and 720-830 nm) emissions originating from atmospheric layers centered at altitudes of 90 km, 97 km, and 250 km were carried out at Irkutsk and of the O_2 (866.5 nm) emission originating from an atmospheric layer centered at altitude of 95 km was carried out at Almaty. Results have shown that the storm-induced solitary large-scale wave with duration of 1 hour and with the front width of 5000 km moved equatorward with the velocity of 200 ms-1 to a distance of no less than 1000 km

The Hamburg/SAO Survey for Emission--Line Galaxies. IV. The Fourth List of 119 Galaxies (A. Y. Kniazev - 7 December, 2000)
We present the fourth list with results of the Hamburg/SAO Survey for Emission-Line Galaxies (HSS hereafter, SAO - Special Astrophysical Observatory, Russia). The list is a result of the follow-up spectroscopy conducted with the 6m SAO RAS telescope in 1998, 1999 and 2000. The data of this snap-shot spectroscopy survey confirmed 127 emission-line objects out of 176 observed candidates and allowed their quantitative spectral classification. We could classify 76 emission-line objects as BCG/HII galaxies or probable BCGs, 8 - as QSOs, 2 - as Seyfert galaxies, 2 - as super-associations in a subluminous spiral and an irregular galaxy, and 37 as low-excitation objects - either starburst nuclei (SBN), or dwarf amorphous nuclei starburst galaxies (DANS). We could not classify 2 ELGs. Furthermore, for 5 galaxies we did not detect any significant emission lines. For 91 emission-line galaxies, the redshifts and/or line intensities are determined for the first time. Of the remaining 28 previously known ELGs we give either improved data on the line intensities or some independent measurements. Among our first priority candidates we achieved a detection rate of emission-line objects (ELGs + QSOs) of 68%, among which 51% are BCGs. We found that the confirmed BCGs have usually a blue colour ((B-R) < 1.0) and a non-stellar appearance in the APM database

BVRcIc photometry of GRB970508 optical remnant: May-August, 1997 (V. V. Sokolov - 26 February, 1998)
We present the results of photometric observations of the variable optical source associated to the remnant of the gamma-ray burst GRB970508 performed at SAO RAS (Russia) from May to August 1997. The brightness of the optical source increased from Rc=21.19 (May 9.75 UT) to Rc=19.70 (May 10.77 UT), whereupon it was decaying in all the four BVRcIc bands during about one month after the burst. The source flux decay after the maximum in the Rc band is well described by a single power-law with index -1.171 for the whole set of observations during 86 days. In particular, in the Ic band the source magnitude is about 23.1 from the 36th day after the GRB to the end of the observations (August 4, 1997).

Massive migration from the steppe is a source for Indo-European languages in Europe (Wolfgang Haak - 10 February, 2015)
At the beginning of the Neolithic period in Europe, ~8,000-7,000 years ago, closely related groups of early farmers appeared in Germany, Hungary, and Spain, different from indigenous hunter-gatherers, whereas Russia was inhabited by a distinctive population of hunter-gatherers with high affinity to a ~24,000 year old Siberian6 . By ~6,000-5,000 years ago, a resurgence of hunter-gatherer ancestry had occurred throughout much of Europe, but in Russia, the Yamnaya steppe herders of this time were descended not only from the preceding eastern European hunter-gatherers, but from a population of Near Eastern ancestry
