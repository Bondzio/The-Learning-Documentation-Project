It Is NL-complete to Decide Whether a Hairpin Completion of Regular Languages Is Regular (Volker Diekert - 25 January, 2011)
The hairpin completion is an operation on formal languages which is inspired by the hairpin formation in biochemistry. In 2009 this decidability problem has been solved positively by providing a polynomial time algorithm
