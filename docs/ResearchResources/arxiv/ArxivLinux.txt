Noise Characterization of IUCAA Digital Sampling Array Controller (IDSAC) (Sabyasachi Chattopadhyay - 3 October, 2018)
Communication with Linux based host computer is through a USB3.0 interface, with the option of using copper or optical fibers. The analytical model predicts the net input referenced noise of the signal chain to be 5 electrons for 200k pixels per second per channel readout rate with 3 samples per pixel. Using a cryogenic test set up in the lab, the noise is measured to be 5.4 e (24.3 \muV), for the same readout configuration.

A Step-by-Step Guide to Using BioNetFit (William S. Hlavacek - 21 September, 2018)
BioNetFit can be used on a laptop or standalone multicore workstation as well as on many Linux clusters, such as those that use the Slurm Workload Manager to schedule jobs. In general, these files include 1) one or more EXP files, which each contains (experimental) data to be used in parameter identification/bootstrapping; 2) a BNGL file containing a model section, which defines a (rule-based) model, and an actions section, which defines simulation protocols that generate GDAT and/or SCAN files with model predictions corresponding to the data in the EXP file(s); and 3) a CONF file that configures the fitting/bootstrapping job and that defines algorithmic parameter settings.

Precision-Aware application execution for Energy-optimization in HPC node system (Radim VavÅÃ­k - 26 January, 2015)
In this paper, we propose a HPC system running with a GNU/Linux OS and a Real Time Resource Manager (RTRM) that is aware and monitors the healthy of the platform. The paper shows a model execution which can improve the precision of results by 65% in average by increasing the number of iterations from 1e3 to 1e4. execution time is computed by the RTOS with the time overhead less than 10% against a native execution.

In August 2011, Linux entered its third decade. published a study of faults found by applying a static analyzer to Linux versions 1.0 through 2.4.1. A major result of their work was that the drivers directory contained up to 7 times more of certain kinds of faults than other directories. What has been the impact of these changes on code quality? To answer this question, we have transported Chou et al.'s experiments to all versions of Linux 2.6; released between 2003 and 2011

The fractal Weyl exponent is found to be $Î½\approx 0.63$ that corresponds to the fractal dimension of the network $d \approx 1.2$. We argue that the fractal Weyl law should be generic for directed networks with the fractal dimension $d<2$.

High Performance Commodity Networking in a 512-CPU Teraflop Beowulf Cluster for Computational Astrophysics (John Dubinski - 7 May, 2003)
The cluster incorporates a cubic network topology based on inexpensive commodity 24-port gigabit switches and point to point connections through the second gigabit port on each Linux server. Networking represents only about 9% of our total system cost of USD$561K. The standard Top 500 HPL Linpack benchmark rating is 1.202 Teraflops on 512 CPUs so computing costs by this measure are $0.47/Megaflop. We also describe 4 different astrophysical applications using complex parallel algorithms for studying large-scale structure formation, galaxy dynamics, magnetohydrodynamic flows onto blackholes and planet formation currently running on the cluster and achieving high parallel performance. The MHD code achieved a sustained speed of 2.2 teraflops in single precision or 44% of the theoretical peak.

Leveraging Software, Advocating Ideology: Free Software and Open Source (Matt Ratto - 25 October, 2001)
This paper uses the software program Linux and the discourse around it in order to examine how software programs can be used to articulate and defend social and economic positions. Another way to state this is that software programs like Linux are socially meaningful through functionality and talk about functionality.
