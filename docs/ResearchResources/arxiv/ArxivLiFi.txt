Holographic Automata for Ambient Immersive A. I. via Reservoir Computing (Theophanes E. Raptis - 20 June, 2018)
We also examine the significance of their dual representation on a frequency or wavelength domain as a superposition of plane waves for distributed computing applications including a new proposal for a "Hologrid" that could be realized with present Wi-Fi,Li-Fi technologies.

A model of orbital angular momentum Li-Fi (Yuanying Zhang - 28 January, 2018)
Our point-to-point scheme with hybrid RGB-OAM encoding, not only increases significantly the information capacity of twisted light, but also offers additional security that supplements the traditional broadcasting visible light communications, e.g., Li-Fi.

Interference Characterization in Downlink Li-Fi Optical Attocell Networks (Atchutananda Surampudi - 13 December, 2017)
Currently, there are no good closed-form approximations to interference in Li-Fi attocell networks, that can be used for the analysis of signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (or coverage), particularly for the case of limited FOVs. In this paper, using a technique from Fourier analysis, we provide a very close approximation to interference in one and two dimension Li-Fi attocell networks for any given finite inter-LED separation

Can Balloons Produce Li-Fi? A Disaster Management Perspective (Atchutananda Surampudi - 13 December, 2017)
Importantly, when a Li-Fi unit is attached to an air balloon and a network of such Li-Fi balloons are coordinated to form a Li-Fi balloon network, data can be accessed anytime and anywhere required and hence many lives can be tracked and saved. We propose this idea of a Li-Fi balloon and give an overview of its design using the Philips Li-Fi hardware

A Feasibility Study of Using Light Fidelity With Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles For Indoor Collaborative And Cooperative Networking (B. O Sadiq - 16 July, 2017)
Li-Fi enables data transmission using visible light through a light emitting diode (LED) and is chosen as against wireless fidelity (Wi- Fi) because it is more ideal for high density wireless data coverage in confined areas, better at addressing radio interference related issues and provides better bandwidth, efficiency, availability and security. Thus, using Light Fidelity as a means of communication necessitates the need to develop a Link Velocity Based Connectivity Algorithm (LVCA) that governs communication between the UAVs and the Li-Fi transmitter and receiver circuits for collaborative and cooperative networking.

Light fidelity (LI-FI) based indoor communication system (Farooq Aftab - 9 June, 2016)
Li-Fi which is an emerging branch of optical wireless communication can be useful in future as a replacement and backup of Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi)for indoor communication because it can provide high data rate of transmission along with high capacity to utilize more users as its spectrum bandwidth is much broader than the radio spectrum. In this paper we will look at the different aspects of the Li-Fi based indoor communication system,summarizes some of the research conducted so far and we will also proposed a Li-Fi based communication model keeping in mind coverage area for multiple user and evaluate its performance under different scenarios .
