Holographic Automata for Ambient Immersive A. I. via Reservoir Computing (Theophanes E. Raptis - 20 June, 2018)
We also examine the significance of their dual representation on a frequency or wavelength domain as a superposition of plane waves for distributed computing applications including a new proposal for a "Hologrid" that could be realized with present Wi-Fi,Li-Fi technologies.

A model of orbital angular momentum Li-Fi (Yuanying Zhang - 28 January, 2018)
Our point-to-point scheme with hybrid RGB-OAM encoding, not only increases significantly the information capacity of twisted light, but also offers additional security that supplements the traditional broadcasting visible light communications, e.g., Li-Fi.

Interference Characterization in Downlink Li-Fi Optical Attocell Networks (Atchutananda Surampudi - 13 December, 2017)
Currently, there are no good closed-form approximations to interference in Li-Fi attocell networks, that can be used for the analysis of signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (or coverage), particularly for the case of limited FOVs. In this paper, using a technique from Fourier analysis, we provide a very close approximation to interference in one and two dimension Li-Fi attocell networks for any given finite inter-LED separation

Can Balloons Produce Li-Fi? A Disaster Management Perspective (Atchutananda Surampudi - 13 December, 2017)
Importantly, when a Li-Fi unit is attached to an air balloon and a network of such Li-Fi balloons are coordinated to form a Li-Fi balloon network, data can be accessed anytime and anywhere required and hence many lives can be tracked and saved. We propose this idea of a Li-Fi balloon and give an overview of its design using the Philips Li-Fi hardware

A Feasibility Study of Using Light Fidelity With Multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles For Indoor Collaborative And Cooperative Networking (B. O Sadiq - 16 July, 2017)
Li-Fi enables data transmission using visible light through a light emitting diode (LED) and is chosen as against wireless fidelity (Wi- Fi) because it is more ideal for high density wireless data coverage in confined areas, better at addressing radio interference related issues and provides better bandwidth, efficiency, availability and security. Thus, using Light Fidelity as a means of communication necessitates the need to develop a Link Velocity Based Connectivity Algorithm (LVCA) that governs communication between the UAVs and the Li-Fi transmitter and receiver circuits for collaborative and cooperative networking.

Light fidelity (LI-FI) based indoor communication system (Farooq Aftab - 9 June, 2016)
Li-Fi which is an emerging branch of optical wireless communication can be useful in future as a replacement and backup of Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi)for indoor communication because it can provide high data rate of transmission along with high capacity to utilize more users as its spectrum bandwidth is much broader than the radio spectrum. In this paper we will look at the different aspects of the Li-Fi based indoor communication system,summarizes some of the research conducted so far and we will also proposed a Li-Fi based communication model keeping in mind coverage area for multiple user and evaluate its performance under different scenarios .

Terminal Orientation in OFDM-based LiFi Systems (Ardimas Andi Purwita - 28 August, 2018)
Light-fidelity (LiFi) is a wireless communication technology that employs both infrared and visible light spectra to support multiuser access and user mobility. It is shown that the effect is notable if the horizontal distance between the UE and the AP is greater than $1.5$ m in a typical $5\times3.5\times3$ m$^3$ indoor room.

Review of LiFi visible light communications : research and use cases (Christophe Jurczak - 5 February, 2018)
The technology has reached maturity, with the first LiFi LED luminaire commercialized in 2016. Real life deployments with a variety of use cases, as well as staggering bandwidth improvements in the lab superior to 10 Gbps, hint to a luminous future for LiFi as a powerful complement or alternative to WiFi and 4G/5G.

Bidirectional User Throughput Maximization Based on Feedback Reduction in LiFi Networks (Mohammad Dehghani Soltani - 10 August, 2017)
Light-Fidelity (LiFi) is a subset of OWCs, and it is a bidirectional, high-speed and fully networked wireless communication technology where visible light and infrared are used in downlink and uplink respectively. In this paper, two techniques for reducing the amount of feedback in LiFi cellular networks are proposed, i) Limited-content feedback (LCF) scheme based on reducing the content of feedback information and ii) Limited-frequency feedback (LFF) based on the update interval scheme that lets the receiver to transmit feedback information after some data frames transmission
