Consistent cosmic shear in the face of systematics: a B-mode analysis of KiDS-450, DES-SV and CFHTLenS (Marika Asgari - 4 October, 2018)
We analyse three public cosmic shear surveys; the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-450), the Dark Energy Survey (DES-SV) and the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). Adopting the COSEBIs statistic to cleanly and completely separate the lensing E-modes from the non-lensing B-modes, we detect B-modes in KiDS-450 and CFHTLenS at the level of about 2.7 $Ï$. For DES- SV we detect B-modes at the level of 2.8 $Ï$ in a non-tomographic analysis, increasing to a 5.5 $Ï$ B-mode detection in a tomographic analysis

Weak-Interaction Tests via Precision Superallowed $Î²$-Decay Studies at TRIUMF (Kyle G. Leach - 27 September, 2018)
The three experimental quantities that are required for performing these tests using $0^+\rightarrow0^+$ nuclear decays (branching ratio, half-life, and $Q$-value) can all be measured to high-precision with rare-isotope beams at the TRIUMF-ISAC facility in Vancouver, Canada. This proceeding presents a brief outline of the general experimental techniques used at TRIUMF over the past 15 years, as well as recent theoretical advances towards {\it ab-initio} isospin-symmetry-breaking corrections to superallowed nuclear decays.

A-type stars in the Canada-France Imaging Survey I. The stellar halo of the Milky Way traced to large radius by blue horizontal branch stars (Guillaume F. Thomas - 21 September, 2018)
These stars are identified photometrically using deep $u-$band imaging from the new Canada-France-Imaging-Survey (CFIS) that reaches 24.5 mag. This is combined with $griz$ bands from Pan-STARRS 1 and covers a total of $\sim4000$ deg$^2$ of the northern sky. We find that outer stellar halo traced by the BHB is well modelled by a broken power law with a constant flattening of $q=0.86 \pm 0.02$, with an inner slope of $Î³=4.24 \pm 0.08$. This is much steeper than the preferred outer profile that has a slope of $Î²=3.21\pm 0.07$ after a break radius of $r_b=41.4^{+2.5}_{-2.4}$ kpc

Evidence for Ultra-Diffuse Galaxy `Formation' Through Galaxy Interactions (Paul Bennet - 4 September, 2018)
We report the discovery of two ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs) which show clear evidence for association with tidal material and interaction with a larger galaxy halo, found during a search of the Wide portion of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). The two new UDGs, NGC2708-Dw1 and NGC5631-Dw1, are faint ($M_g$=$-$13.7 and $-$11.8 mag), extended ($r_h$=2.60 and 2.15 kpc) and have low central surface brightness ($Î¼(g,0)$=24.9 and 27.3 mag arcsec$^{-2}$), while the stellar stream associated with each has a surface brightness $Î¼(g)$$\gtrsim$28.2 mag arcsec$^{-2}$

High-redshift quasar selection from the CFHQSIR survey (S. Pipien - 6 October, 2018)
The Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey in the Near Infrared (CFHQSIR) has been carried out to search for z ~ 7 quasars using near-infrared and optical imaging from the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). Our data consist of $\rm{\sim 130\,deg^{2}}$ of Wide-field Infrared Camera (WIRCam) Y-band images up to a 5Ï limit of $\rm{Y_{AB}}$ ~ 22.4 distributed over the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) Wide fields. After follow-up observations in J band, a first photometric selection based on simple colour criteria led us to identify 36 sources with measured high-redshift quasar colours. However, we expect to detect only ~ 2 quasars in the redshift range 6.8 < z < 7.5 down to a rest-frame absolute magnitude of $\rm{M_{1450}}$ = -24.6

A Unified Analysis of Four Cosmic Shear Surveys (Chihway Chang - 28 August, 2018)
To assess the robustness of the existing cosmic shear results, we present in this paper a unified analysis of four of the recent cosmic shear surveys: the Deep Lens Survey (DLS), the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS), the Science Verification data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES-SV), and the 450 deg$^{2}$ release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-450). For our fiducial analysis choice, considering a Gaussian covariance, conservative scale cuts, assuming no baryonic feedback contamination, identical cosmological parameter priors and intrinsic alignment treatments, we find the constraints (mean, 16% and 84% confidence intervals) on the parameter $S_{8}\equiv Ï_{8}(Î©_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}$ to be $S_{8}=0.94_{-0.045}^{+0.046}$ (DLS), $0.66_{-0.071}^{+0.070}$ (CFHTLenS), $0.84_{-0.061}^{+0.062}$ (DES-SV) and $0.76_{-0.049}^{+0.048}$ (KiDS-450). The combined constraints are $S_{8}=0.79^{+0.042}_{-0.041}$, which is in good agreement with the first year of DES cosmic shear results and recent CMB constraints from the Planck satellite.

Neutron detection in the SNO+ water phase (Y. Liu - 21 August, 2018)
SNO+ is a multipurpose neutrino experiment located approximately 2 km underground in SNOLAB, Sudbury, Canada. The detector started taking physics data in May 2017 and is currently completing its first phase, as a pure water Cherenkov detector. The low trigger threshold of the SNO+ detector allows for a substantial neutron detection efficiency, as observed with a deployed ^{241}Am^{9}Be source. Using a statistical analysis of one hour AmBe calibration data, we report a neutron capture constant of 208.2 + 2.1(stat.) us and a lower bound of the neutron detection efficiency of 46% at the center of the detector.

Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer Low Moderate Resolution Spectrograph Conceptual Design (Patrick Caillier - 23 July, 2018)
The Maunakea Spectroscopic Explorer (MSE) Project is a planned replacement for the existing 3.6-m Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) into a 10-m class dedicated wide field highly multiplexed fibre fed spectroscopic facility. The MSE is based on a prime focus telescope concept which illuminate 3200 fibres or more. The LMR will provide 2 resolution modes at R>2500 and R>5000 on a wavelength range of 360 to 950 nm and a resolution of R>3000 on the 950 nm to 1300 nm bandwidth. Possibly the H band will be also covered by a second NIR mode from ranging from 1450 to 1780 nm. The HR will have a resolution of R>39000 on the 360 to 600 nm wavelength range and R>20000 on the 600 to 900 nm bandwidth. This paper presents the LMR design after its Conceptual Design Review held in June 2017

EasyCritics II. Testing its efficiency: new gravitational lens candidates in CFHTLenS (M. Carrasco - 10 July, 2018)
We report the results of $EasyCritics$, a fully automated algorithm for the efficient search of strong-lensing (SL) regions in wide-field surveys, applied to the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). By using only the photometric information of the brightest elliptical galaxies distributed over a wide redshift range ($\smash{0.2 \lesssim z \lesssim 0.9}$) and without requiring the identification of arcs, our algorithm produces lensing potential models and catalogs of critical curves of the entire survey area. In a specific configuration, $EasyCritics$ generates only $\sim1200$ possibly super-critical regions in the CFHTLS area, drastically reducing the effective area for inspection from $154$ sq. Among the pre-selected SL regions, we identify 32 of the 44 previously known lenses on the group and cluster scale, and discover 9 new promising lens candidates. Although future comparisons against numerical simulations are required for fully assessing the efficiency of $EasyCritics$, the algorithm seems very promising for upcoming surveys covering $\smash{10^{4}}$ sq

The XXL Survey XXVIII. Galaxy luminosity functions of the XXL-N clusters (M. Ricci - 10 July, 2018)
Our study is based on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) photometric galaxy catalogue,associated with photometric redshifts. Our main findings concerning the evolution of the galaxy luminosity distribution with redshift and richness are that, in the inner region of clusters and in the redshift-mass range we probe (about $0<z<1$ and $10^{13} M_{\odot}<M_{500}<5\times10^{14}M_{\odot}$), the bright part of the LF (BCG excluded) does not depend much on mass or redshift except for its amplitude, whereas the BCG luminosity increases both with redshift and richness, and its scatter decreases with redshift.

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping Project: Quasar Host Galaxies at $z < 0.8$ from Image Decomposition (Minghao Yue - 24 June, 2018)
We stack the multi-epoch images in the $g$ and $i$ bands taken by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. The combined $g$-band ($i$-band) images reach a $5Ï$ depth of 26.2 (25.2) mag, with a typical PSF size of $0.7"$ ($0.6"$). The systematic errors of the measured host galaxy flux in the two bands are 0.23 and 0.18 mag. The relative errors of the measured galaxy half-light radii ($R_e$) are about 13%. We estimate the rest-frame $u$- and $g$-band flux of the host galaxies, and find that the AGN-to-galaxy flux ratios in the $g$ band are between 0.9 to 4.4 (68.3% confidence). These galaxies have high stellar masses $M_\ast = 10^{10}\sim10^{11}\, M_\odot$

A MegaCam Survey of Outer Halo Satellites. III. Photometric and Structural Parameters (Ricardo R. Munoz - 18 June, 2018)
We present structural parameters from a wide-field homogeneous imaging survey of Milky Way satellites carried out with the MegaCam imagers on the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and 6.5m Magellan-Clay telescope. Our survey targets an unbiased sample of "outer halo" satellites (i.e., substructures having Galactocentric distances greater than 25 kpc) and includes classical dSph galaxies, ultra-faint dwarfs, and remote globular clusters. We combine deep, panoramic $gr$ imaging for 44 satellites and archival $gr$ imaging for 14 additional objects (primarily obtained with the DECam instrument as part of the Dark Energy Survey), to measure photometric and structural parameters for 58 outer halo satellites. This is the largest and most uniform analysis of Milky Way satellites undertaken to date and represents roughly three quarters ($58/81 \simeq$72\%) of all known outer halo satellites

Also, we find a strong dependence of the lensing signal on the group concentration parameter, with the most concentrated quintile showing a significant lensing signal, consistent with an isothermal sphere with $Ï_V =336 \pm 28$ km/s and a NFW profile with $R_{200}=0.60\pm0.05$ $h_{70}^{-1}$Mpc

OSSOS. VII. 800+ trans-Neptunian objects - the complete data release (Michele T. Bannister - 29 May, 2018)

We present 838 outer Solar System discoveries that are entirely free of ephemeris bias. This increases the inventory of trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) with accurately known orbits by nearly 50%. Our 313 resonant TNOs, including 132 plutinos, triple the available characterized sample and include new occupancy of distant resonances out to semi-major axis $a \sim 130$ au. OSSOS doubles the known population of the non-resonant Kuiper belt, providing 436 TNOs in this region, all with exceptionally high-quality orbits of $a$ uncertainty $Ï_{a} \leq 0.1\%$; they show the belt exists from $a \gtrsim 37$ au, with a lower perihelion bound of $35$ au.

Extended Structures of Planetary Nebulae Detected in H$_{2}$ Emission (Xuan Fang - 24 April, 2018)
These images were collected with the Wide-field InfraRed Camera (WIRCam) on the 3.6m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT); their unprecedented depth and wide field of view allow us to find extended nebular structures in H$_{2}$ emission in several PNe, some of these being the first detection. The nebular morphologies in H$_{2}$ emission are studied in analogy with the optical images, and indication on stellar wind interactions is discussed. In particular, the complete structure of the highly asymmetric halo in NGC6772 is witnessed in H$_{2}$, which strongly suggests interaction with the interstellar medium. Our sample confirms the general correlation between H$_{2}$ emission and the bipolarity of PNe. The knotty/filamentary fine structures of the H$_{2}$ gas are resolved in the inner regions of several ring-like PNe, also confirming the previous argument that H2 emission mostly comes from knots/clumps embedded within fully ionized material at the equatorial regions. Moreover, the deep H$_{2}$ image of the butterfly-shaped Sh1-89, after removal of field stars, clearly reveals a tilted ring structure at the waist

SPIRou is a near-infrared (nIR) spectropolarimeter / velocimeter for the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), that will focus on two forefront science topics, (i) the quest for habitable Earth-like planets around nearby M stars, and (ii) the study of low-mass star/planet formation in the presence of magnetic fields. SPIRou will cover a wide spectral domain in a single exposure (0.98-2.44um at a resolving power of 70K, yielding unpolarized and polarized spectra of low-mass stars with a 15% average throughput at a radial velocity (RV) precision of 1 m/s. SPIRou is currently integrated at IRAP/OMP and will be mounted at CFHT in 2017 Q4 for a first light scheduled in late 2017. Science operation is predicted to begin in 2018 S2, allowing many fruitful synergies with major ground and space instruments such as the JWST, TESS, ALMA and later-on PLATO and the ELT.

Color Dispersion as an Indicator of Stellar Population Complexity: Insights from the Pixel Color-Magnitude Diagrams of 32 Bright Galaxies in Abell 1139 and Abell 2589 (Joon Hyeop Lee - 19 March, 2018)
The sample is 32 galaxies brighter than Mr = -21.3 mag with spectroscopic redshifts, which are deeply imaged in the g and r bands using the MegaCam mounted on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We find that the best set of parameters for galaxy classification is the combination of the minimum color dispersion at mu_r <= 21.2 mag/arcsec^2 and the maximum color dispersion at 20.0 <= mu_r <= 21.0 mag/arcsec^2: the latter reflects the complexity of stellar populations at the disk component in a typical spiral galaxy. Finally, the color dispersion measurements of an elliptical galaxy appear to be correlated with the WISE infrared color ([4.6] - [12])

The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS). XVIII. Measurement and Calibration of Surface Brightness Fluctuation Distances for Bright Galaxies in Virgo (and Beyond) (Michele Cantiello - 15 February, 2018)
We describe a program to measure surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distances to galaxies observed in the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (NGVS), a photometric imaging survey covering $104~deg^2$ of the Virgo cluster in the ${u}^*,g,i,z$ bandpasses with the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope. We adopt the ${u}^*{-}z$ calibration as reference for the present galaxy sample, with an observed scatter of 0.11 mag. For a few cases that lack good ${u}^*$ photometry, we use an alternative relation based on a combination of $g{-}i$ and $g{-}z$ colors, with only a slightly larger observed scatter of 0.12 mag. We present a preliminary catalog of distances for 89 galaxies brighter than $B_T\approx13.0$ mag within the survey footprint, including members of the background M and W Clouds at roughly twice the distance of the main body of the Virgo cluster

The sensitivity of the survey is of f(Halpha) ~ 4 x 10^-17 erg sec-1 cm^-2 (5 sigma detection limit) for point sources and Sigma (Halpha) ~ 2 x 10^-18 erg sec^-1 cm^-2 arcsec^-2 (1 sigma detection limit at 3 arcsec resolution) for extended sources, making VESTIGE the deepest and largest blind narrow-band survey of a nearby cluster

The optical properties of galaxies in the Ophiuchus cluster (Florence Durret - 25 January, 2018)
Based on a deep image of the Ophiuchus cluster in the r' band obtained at the Canada France Hawaii Telescope with the MegaCam camera, we have applied an iterative process to subtract the contribution of the numerous stars that pollute the image, due to the low Galactic latitude of the cluster, and obtained a photometric catalogue of 2818 galaxies fully complete at r'=20.5 mag and still 91% complete at r'=21.5 mag. We then compute density maps based on an adaptive kernel technique, for different magnitude limits, and define three circular regions covering 0.08, 0.08 and 0.06 deg^2 respectively centered on the cluster (C), northwest (NW) and southeast (SE) of the cluster, in which we compute the GLFs

Evolution of the cluster optical galaxy luminosity function in the CFHTLS : breaking the degeneracy between mass and redshift (Florian Sarron - 1 February, 2018)
We develop an improved version of the AMACFI cluster finder (now AMASCFI) and apply it to the 154 deg2 of the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) to obtain a catalogue of 1371 cluster candidates with mass M200 > 10^14 Msun and redshift z < 0.7. This sample is 90% pure and 70% complete, therefore our results are representative the cluster population in these redshift and mass ranges. We find an increase of both the ETG and LTG faint populations with decreasing redshift (with Schechter slopes alpha_ETG = -0.65 +/- 0.03 at z=0.6 and alpha_ETG = -0.79 +\- 0.02 at z=0.2) and also a decrease of the LTG bright end, but not of the ETG's. These results show that the cluster red sequence is mainly formed at redshift z > 0.7, and that faint ETGs continue to enrich the red sequence through quenching of brighter LTGs at z < 0.7

Predictions of planet detections with near infrared radial velocities in the up-coming SPIRou Legacy Survey-Planet Search (Ryan Cloutier - 18 December, 2017)
The SPIRou near infrared spectro-polarimeter is destined to begin science operations at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope in mid-2018. One of the instrument's primary science goals is to discover the closest exoplanets to the Solar System by conducting a 3-5 year long radial velocity survey of nearby M dwarfs at an expected precision of $\sim 1$ m s$^{-1}$; the SPIRou Legacy Survey-Planet Search (SLS-PS). With our fiducial survey strategy and expected instrument performance over a nominal survey length of $\sim 3$ years, we expect SPIRou to detect $85.3^{+29.3}_{-12.4}$ planets including $20.0^{+16.8}_{-7.2}$ habitable zone planets and $8.1^{+7.6}_{-3.2}$ Earth-like planets from a sample of 100 M1-M8.5 dwarfs out to 11 pc. By studying mid-to-late M dwarfs previously inaccessible to existing optical velocimeters, SPIRou will put meaningful constraints on the occurrence rate of planets around those stars including the value of $Î·_{\oplus}$ at an expected level of precision of $\lesssim 45$%

In particular, the significance of the measurement for clusters with $z>1.0$ is 4.1$Ï$; for the entire cluster sample we obtained an average M$_{200}$ of $1.28^{+0.23}_{-0.21}$ $\times 10^{14} \, \textrm{M}_{\odot}$.

CFHQSIR: a Y-band extension of the CFHTLS-Wide survey (S. Pipien - 18 April, 2018)
The Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) has been conducted over a five-year period at the CFHT with the MegaCam instrument, totaling 450 nights of observations. The Wide Synoptic Survey is one component of the CFHTLS, covering 155 square degrees in four patches of 23 to 65 square degrees through the whole MegaCam filter set (u*, g', r', i', z') down to i'$_{AB}$ = 24.5. With the motivation of searching for high-redshift quasars at redshifts above 6.5, we extend the multi-wavelength CFHTLS-Wide data in the Y-band down to magnitudes of $\sim$ 22.5 for point sources (5$Ï$). We measure a limiting magnitude of Y$_{AB} \simeq 22.4$ for point sources (5$Ï$) in an aperture diameter of 0.93", over 130 square degrees. We find that the addition of the CFHQSIR Y-band data to the CFHTLS optical data increases the accuracy of photometric redshifts and reduces the outlier rate from 13.8% to 8.8% in the redshift range 1.05 $\lesssim$ z $\lesssim$ 1.2.

Chemical Mapping of the Milky Way With The Canada-France Imaging Survey: A Non-parametric Metallicity-Distance Decomposition of the Galaxy (Rodrigo Ibata - 21 August, 2017)
We present the chemical distribution of the Milky Way, based on 2,900$\, {\rm deg^2}$ of $u$-band photometry taken as part of the Canada-France Imaging Survey. By combing the CFHT $u$-band photometry together with SDSS and Pan-STARRS $g,r,$ and $i$, we demonstrate that we are able to measure reliably the metallicities of individual stars to $\sim 0.2$ dex, and hence additionally obtain good photometric distance estimates. This survey thus permits the measurement of metallicities and distances of the dominant main-sequence population out to approximately 30 kpc, and provides much higher number of stars at large extraplanar distances than have been available from previous surveys. As traced in main-sequence stars, the stellar halo component shows a vertical density profile that is close to exponential, with a scale height of around 3 kpc

This paper presents the first measurement of IA at high redshift, $z\sim 1.4$, using the spectroscopic catalog of blue star-forming galaxies of the FastSound redshift survey, with the galaxy shape information from the Canada-Hawaii-France telescope lensing survey. The IA signal is consistent with zero with power-law amplitudes fitted to the projected correlation functions for density-shape and shape-shape correlation components, $A_{Î´+}=-0.0071\pm 0.1340$ and $A_{++}=-0.0505\pm 0.0848$, respectively. The upper limit of the constrained IA amplitude corresponds to a few percent contamination to the weak-lensing shear power spectrum, resulting in systematic uncertainties on the cosmological parameter estimations by $-0.052<ÎÏ_8<0.039$ and $-0.039<ÎÎ©_m<0.030$.

An analysis of 4.44 live days (fiducial exposure of 9.87 tonne-days) of data taken with the nearly full detector during the initial filling phase demonstrates the detector performance and the best electronic recoil rejection using pulse-shape discrimination in argon, with leakage $<1.2\times 10^{-7}$ (90% C.L.) between 16 and 33 keV$_{ee}$. No candidate signal events are observed, which results in the leading limit on WIMP-nucleon spin-independent cross section on argon, $<1.2\times 10^{-44}$ cm$^2$ for a 100 GeV/c$^2$ WIMP mass (90% C.L.).

Binning the satellites by stellar mass we provide a direct measurement of the subhalo-to-stellar-mass relation, $\log m_\mathrm{bg}/\mathrm{M}_\odot = (11.54\pm0.05) + (0.95\pm0.10)\log[m_\star/(2\times10^{10}\mathrm{M}_\odot)]$. This best-fitting relation implies that, at a stellar mass $m_\star\sim3\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$, subhalo masses are roughly 50 per cent of those of central galaxies, and this fraction decreases at higher stellar masses

After a selection of our best richness subsample ($20<Î»<50$), this is the most comprehensive lensing study of a $\sim 100\%$ complete and $\sim 90\%$ pure optical cluster catalogue in this redshift range, with a total of 346 clusters in $\sim164~deg^2$.

When compared to X-ray masses and mass proxies, we find that on average weak lensing masses are $\sim 10\%$ higher than those derived in the X-ray in the range $2\times10^{13}M_{\rm \odot}<E(z) M^{X}_{\rm 200}<2\times10^{14}M_{\rm \odot}$, in agreement with most previous results and simulations

We train and apply convolutional neural networks, a machine learning technique developed to learn from and classify image data, to Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) imaging for the identification of potential strong lensing systems. The networks were able to learn the features of simulated lenses with accuracy of up to 99.8% and a purity and completeness of 94-100% on a test set of 2000 simulations. An ensemble of trained networks was applied to all of the 171 square degrees of the CFHTLS wide field image data, identifying 18,861 candidates including 63 known and 139 other potential lens candidates. A second search of 1.4 million early type galaxies selected from the survey catalog as potential deflectors, identified 2,465 candidates including 117 previously known lens candidates, 29 confirmed lenses/high-quality lens candidates, 266 novel probable or potential lenses and 2097 candidates we classify as false positives. For the catalog-based search we estimate a completeness of 21-28% with respect to detectable lenses and a purity of 15%, with a false-positive rate of 1 in 671 images tested.

The overall symmetry of random walks in semi-major axis allow diffusion to populate 2013 SY$_{99}$'s orbital parameter space from the 1000-2000 au inner fringe of the Oort cloud. Diffusion affects other known TNOs on orbits with perihelia of 45 to 49 au and semi-major axes beyond 250 au, providing a formation mechanism that implies an extended population, gently cycling into and returning from the inner fringe of the Oort cloud.

SDSS J1640+1932: a spectacular galaxy-quasar strong lens system (Lin Wang - 21 March, 2017)
We present Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) MegaCam observations of a galaxy-quasar strong gravitational lens system, SDSS J1640+1932. Our CFHT imaging with an angular resolution of 0.7$^{\prime \prime}$ clearly resolves 4 lensed images and a nearly complete Einstein ring. Modeling the system with a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) total mass distribution, we find an Einstein radius of ${2.49^{\prime \prime}}_{-0.049}^{+0.063}$ enclosing a inferred mass of $7.25_{-0.29}^{+0.37}\times10^{11} M_{\odot}$. The quasar and its host galaxy have been magnified by a factor of 23, and the time delay relative to the leading image is determined to be 23.4-25.2 days

Low-mass young stellar population and star formation history of the cluster IC 1805 in the W4 H{\sc ii} region (Neelam Panwar - 10 March, 2017)
With the aim to unravel the low-mass stellar population of the cluster, we present the results of a multiwavelength study based on deep optical data obtained with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, infrared data from 2MASS, $Spitzer$ Space Telescope and X-ray data from $Chandra$ Space Telescope. We identified 384 candidate young stellar objects (YSOs; 101 Class I/II and 283 Class III) within the cluster using various colour-colour and colour-magnitude diagrams. We inferred the mean age of the identified YSOs to be $\sim$ 2.5 Myr and mass in the range 0.3 - 2.5 M$_\odot$. The mass function of our YSO sample has a power law index of -1.23 $\pm$ 0.23, close to the Salpeter value (-1.35), and consistent with those of other star-forming complexes. We also studied the spatial correlation of the YSOs with the distribution of gas and dust of the complex to conclude that IC 1805 would have formed in a large filamentary cloud.

The splitting of double-component active asteroid P/2016 J1 (PANSTARRS) (Fernando Moreno - 13 February, 2017)
The observations were acquired at the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) from mid March to late July, 2016. A statistical analysis of backward-in-time integrations of the orbits of a large sample of clone objects of P/2016 J1-A and J1-B shows that the minimum separation between them occurred most likely $\sim$2300 days prior to the current perihelion passage, i.e., during the previous orbit near perihelion. Monte Carlo dust tail models show that those two components became active simultaneously $\sim$250 days before the current perihelion, with comparable maximum loss rates of $\sim$0.7 kg s$^{-1}$ and $\sim$0.5 kg s$^{-1}$, and total ejected masses of 8$\times$10$^{6}$ kg and 6$\times$10$^{6}$ kg for fragments J1-A and J1-B, respectively. The simultaneous activation times of the two components and the fact that the activity lasted 6 to 9 months or longer, strongly indicate ice sublimation as the most likely mechanism involved in the dust emission process.

Widening of Protostellar Outflows: an Infrared Outflow Survey in Low Luminosity Objects (Tien-Hao Hsieh - 9 February, 2017)
Using the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, we detected outflows toward eight LLOs out of 20 at Ks band, and based on archival Spitzer IRAC1 images, we added four outflow-driving sources from the remaining 12 sources. To study the widening of outflow cavities, we compare our sample with the young stellar objects from Arce & Sargent 2006 and Velusamy et al. 2014 in the plot of opening angle versus bolometric temperature taken as an evolutionary indicator.Our LLO targets match well the trend of increasing opening angle with bolometric temperature reported by Arce & Sargent and are broadly consistent with that reported by Velusamy et al., suggesting that the opening angle could be a good evolutionary indicator for LLOs. Accordingly, we conclude that at least 40% of the outflow-driving LLOs in our sample are young Class 0 objects.

A hot Jupiter around the very active weak-line T Tauri star TAP 26 (L. Yu - 5 January, 2017)
We report the results of an extended spectropolarimetric and photometric monitoring of the weak-line T Tauri star TAP 26, carried out within the MaTYSSE programme with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the 3.6 m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Applying Zeeman-Doppler Imaging to our observations, concentrating in 2015 November and 2016 January and spanning 72 d in total, 16 d in 2015 November and 13 d in 2016 January, we reconstruct surface brightness and magnetic field maps for both epochs and demonstrate that both distributions exhibit temporal evolution not explained by differential rotation alone. We report the detection of a hot Jupiter (hJ) around TAP 26 using three different methods, two using Zeeman-Doppler Imaging (ZDI) and one Gaussian-Process Regression (GPR), with a false-alarm probability smaller than 6.10^-4. However, as a result of the aliasing related to the observing window, the orbital period cannot be uniquely determined; the orbital period with highest likelihood is 10.79 +/- 0.14 d followed by 8.99 +/- 0.09 d. Assuming the most likely period, and that the planet orbits in the stellar equatorial plane, we obtain that the planet has a minimum mass M.sin(i) of 1.66 +/- 0.31 M_Jup and orbits at 0.0968 +/- 0.0032 au from its host star

The Galaxy--Halo Connection in High-Redshift Universe: Details and Evolution of Stellar-to-Halo Mass Ratios of Lyman Break Galaxies on CFHTLS Deep Fields (Shogo Ishikawa - 5 April, 2017)
We present the results of clustering analyses of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at $z\sim3$, $4$, and $5$ using the final data release of the Canada--France--Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). Mean halo masses, calculated as $\langle M_{h} \rangle=10^{11.7}-10^{12.8}h^{-1}M_{\odot}$, increase with stellar-mass limit of LBGs. Satellite fractions of dropout galaxies, even at less massive haloes, are found to drop sharply from $z=2$ down to less than $0.04$ at $z=3-5$. These results suggest that satellite galaxies form inefficiently within dark haloes at $z=3-5$ even for less massive satellites with $M_{\star}<10^{10}M_{\odot}$. We derive observationally, for the first time, $M_{\rm h}^{\rm pivot}$, which is the halo mass at a peak in the star-formation efficiency, at $3<z<5$, and it shows a little increasing trend with cosmic time at $z>3$. In addition, $M_{\rm h}^{\rm pivot}$ and its normalization are found to be almost unchanged during $0<z<5$. Our study shows an observational evidence that galaxy formation is ubiquitously most efficient near a halo mass of $M_{\rm h}\sim10^{12}M_{\odot}$ over cosmic time.

The relation between globular cluster systems and supermassive black holes in spiral galaxies. The case study of NGC 4258 (Rosa A. GonzÃ¡lez-LÃ³pezlira - 16 December, 2016)
We present results for the Sbc galaxy NGC 4258, from Canada France Hawaii Telescope data. Thanks to water masers with Keplerian rotation in a circumnuclear disk, NGC 4258 has the most precisely measured extragalactic distance and supermassive black hole mass to date. The mean optical and optical-near infrared colors of the clusters are consistent with those of the Milky Way and M 31, after extinction is taken into account. We directly identify 39 GC candidates; after completeness correction, GC luminosity function extrapolation and correction for spatial coverage, we calculate a total $N_{\rm GC} = 144\pm31^{+38}_{-36}$ (random and systematic uncertainties, respectively). We have thus increased to 6 the sample of spiral galaxies with measurements of both $M_\bullet$ and $N_{\rm GC}$. NGC 4258 has a specific frequency $S_{\rm N} = 0.4\pm0.1$ (random uncertainty), and is consistent within 2$Ï$ with the $N_{\rm GC}$ vs

Deep CFHT Y-band imaging of VVDS-F22 field: I. data products and photometric redshifts (Dezi Liu - 20 August, 2018)

The scientific goals of the project are to select faint quasar candidates at redshift $z>2.2$, and constrain the photometric redshifts for quasars and galaxies.

However, the 2012 data indicate a distinctive polar spot. Using magnetic features, we determined an average equatorial rotational velocity, Î©_eq, of 2.50 +/- 0.08 rad/d.

Confronting semi-analytic galaxy models with galaxy-matter correlations observed by CFHTLenS (Hananeh Saghiha - 22 February, 2017)
We compare predictions from the Garching and Durham models implemented on the Millennium Run with observations of galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL) and galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing (G3L) for various galaxy samples with stellar masses in the range 0.5 < (M_* / 10^10 M_Sun) < 32 and photometric redshift range 0.2 < z < 0.6 in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). Quantitatively, the models succeed in reproducing the observed signals in the highest stellar mass bin (16 < ( M_* / 10^10 M_Sun) < 32) but show different degrees of tension for the other stellar mass samples. The Durham models are strongly excluded at the 95% confidence level by the observations as they largely over-predict the amplitudes of the GGL and G3L signals, probably because they predict too many satellite galaxies in massive halos.

This model can be used to measure line broadening of typically a few km/s even at low spectral resolution (R less than 5000). We have also derived deep and spatially resolved velocity maps of the Halo in [NII] and Halpha and found that the brightest bubbles are originating from two bipolar structures with a velocity difference of more than 35 km/s lying at the poles of a possibly unique Halo shell expanding at a velocity of more than 15 km/s.

Geoneutrinos and reactor antineutrinos at SNO+ (M Baldoncini - 20 July, 2016)
In the heart of the Creighton Mine near Sudbury (Canada), the SNO+ detector is foreseen to observe almost in equal proportion electron antineutrinos produced by U and Th in the Earth and by nuclear reactors. SNO+ will be the first long baseline experiment to measure a reactor signal dominated by CANDU cores ($\sim$55\% of the total reactor signal), which generally burn natural uranium. Approximately 18\% of the total geoneutrino signal is generated by the U and Th present in the rocks of the Huronian Supergroup-Sudbury Basin: the 60\% uncertainty on the signal produced by this lithologic unit plays a crucial role on the discrimination power on the mantle signal as well as on the geoneutrino spectral shape reconstruction, which can in principle provide a direct measurement of the Th/U ratio in the Earth.

In these fields, we investigate the large-scale projected sky distribution of $z\sim3\mathrm{-}6$ Lyman break galaxies and identify 21 protocluster candidates from regions that are overdense at more than $4Ï$ overdensity significance. Based on cosmological simulations, it is expected that more than $76\%$ of these candidates will evolve into a galaxy cluster of at least a halo mass of $10^{14}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$ at $z=0$. In total we target 462 dropout candidates and obtain 138 spectroscopic redshifts. We confirm three real protoclusters at $z=3\mathrm{-}4$ with more than five members spectroscopically identified, and find one to be an incidental overdense region by mere chance alignment.

CFHTLenS and RCSLenS Cross-Correlation with Planck Lensing Detected in Fourier and Configuration Space (Joachim Harnois-DÃ©raps - 25 April, 2016)
We measure the cross-correlation signature between the Planck CMB lensing map and the weak lensing observations from both the Red-sequence Cluster Lensing Survey (RCSLenS) and the Canada-France-Hawai Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). Combining 747.2 deg$^2$ from both surveys, we find a detection significance that exceeds $4.2Ï$ in both Fourier- and configuration-space analyses. Scaling the predictions by a free parameter $A$, we obtain $A^{\rm Planck}_{\rm CFHT}= 0.68\pm 0.31 $ and $A^{\rm Planck}_{\rm RCS}= 1.31\pm 0.33$

RCSLenS: The Red Cluster Sequence Lensing Survey (H. Hildebrandt - 29 August, 2016)
We present the Red-sequence Cluster Lensing Survey (RCSLenS), an application of the methods developed for the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) to the ~785deg$^2$, multi-band imaging data of the Red-sequence Cluster Survey 2 (RCS2). In total we analyse 761 pointings with r-band coverage, which constitutes our lensing sample. The effective number density of lensing sources over an unmasked area of 571.7deg$^2$ and down to a magnitude limit of r~24.5 is 8.1 galaxies per arcmin$^2$ (weighted: 5.5 arcmin$^{-2}$) distributed over 14 patches on the sky. Photometric redshifts based on 4-band griz data are available for 513 pointings covering an unmasked area of 383.5 deg$^2$ We present weak lensing mass reconstructions of some example clusters as well as the full survey representing the largest areas that have been mapped in this way

Precise Pointing and Stabilization Performance for the Balloon-borne Imaging Testbed (BIT): 2015 Test Flight (L. J. Romualdez - 3 March, 2016)

Cosmological Constraint on the Light Gravitino Mass from CMB Lensing and Cosmic Shear (Ken Osato - 19 May, 2016)
We derive constraints on the light gravitino mass using the data of cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing from Planck and of cosmic shear from the Canada France Hawaii Lensing Survey, combined with analyses of the primary CMB anisotropies and the signature of baryon acoustic oscillations in galaxy distributions. The obtained constraint on the gravitino mass is $m_{3/2} < 4.7$ eV (95% C.L.), which is substantially tighter than the previous constraint from clustering analysis of Ly-$Î±$ forests.

Constraining Multiplicative Bias in CFHTLenS Weak Lensing Shear Data (Jia Liu - 4 May, 2016)
Several recent cosmological analyses have found tension between constraints derived from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) data and those derived from other data sets, such as the Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature anisotropies. Similarly, a direct cross-correlation of the CFHTLenS data with Planck CMB lensing data yielded an anomalously low amplitude compared to expectations based on Planck or WMAP-derived cosmological parameters (Liu & Hill 2015). We analyze three magnitude-limited galaxy samples, finding 2-4sigma evidence for m<1 using the deepest sample (i<24), while the others are consistent with m=1 (no bias)

The XXL Survey X: K-band luminosity - weak-lensing mass relation for groups and clusters of galaxies (F. Ziparo - 17 December, 2015)

For the first time, we have measured this relation via weak-lensing analysis down to $M_{500,WL} =3.5 \times 10^{13}\,M_\odot$. The clusters in our sample span a wide range in mass, $M_{500,WL} =0.35-12.10 \times 10^{14}\,M_\odot$, at $0<z<0.6$. The K-band luminosity scales as $\log_{10}(L_{K,500}/10^{12}L_\odot) \propto Î²log_{10}(M_{500,WL}/10^{14}M_\odot)$ with $Î²= 0.85^{+0.35}_{-0.27}$ and an intrinsic scatter of $Ï_{lnL_K|M} =0.37^{+0.19}_{-0.17}$

Mitigating Systematic Errors in Angular Correlation Function Measurements from Wide Field Surveys (Christopher Brian Morrison - 14 September, 2015)
We take the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) as an example. Variations in galaxy selection due to systematics are found to cause density fluctuations of up to 10% for some small fraction of the area for most galaxy redshift slices and as much as 50% for some extreme cases of faint high-redshift samples. This results in correlations of galaxies against survey systematics of order $\sim$1% when averaged over the survey area. We impose a criterion for using a galaxy sample in a magnification measurement of the majority of the systematic correlations show improvement and are less than 10% of the expected magnification signal when combined in the galaxy cross correlation. After correction the galaxy samples in CFHTLenS satisfy this criterion for $z_{\rm phot}<0.9$ and will be used in a future analysis of magnification.

A direct measurement of tomographic lensing power spectra from CFHTLenS (Fabian KÃ¶hlinger - 23 November, 2015)
We measure the weak gravitational lensing shear power spectra and their cross-power in two photometric redshift bins from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). We find the 68 per cent credible intervals in the $Ï_8$-$Î©_{\rm m}$-plane to be marginally consistent with results from $Planck$ for a simple five parameter $Î$CDM model. For the projected parameter $S_8 \equiv Ï_8(Î©_{\rm m}/0.3)^{0.5}$ we obtain a best-fitting value of $S_8 = 0.768_{-0.039}^{+0.045}$. Our most conservative model, including modifications to the power spectrum due to baryon feedback and marginalization over photometric redshift errors, yields an upper limit on the total mass of three degenerate massive neutrinos of $Î£m_Î½< 4.53 \, {\rm eV}$ at 95 per cent credibility, while a Bayesian model comparison does not favour any model extension beyond a simple five parameter $Î$CDM model. Combining the shear likelihood with $Planck$ breaks the $Ï_8$-$Î©_{\rm m}$-degeneracy and yields $Ï_8=0.818 \pm 0.013$ and $Î©_{\rm m} = 0.300 \pm 0.011$ which is fully consistent with results from $Planck$ alone.

The Reactivation of Main-Belt Comet 324P/La Sagra (P/2010 R2) (Henry H. Hsieh - 28 August, 2015)
We present observations using the Baade Magellan and Canada-France-Hawaii telescopes showing that main-belt comet 324P/La Sagra, formerly known as P/2010 R2, has become active again for the first time since originally observed to be active in 2010-2011. The object appears point-source-like in March and April 2015 as it approached perihelion (true anomaly of ~300 deg), but was ~1 mag brighter than expected if inactive, suggesting the presence of unresolved dust emission. Activity was confirmed by observations of a cometary dust tail in May and June 2015. We find an apparent net dust production rate of <0.1 kg/s during these observations. Further observations during the current active period will allow direct comparisons of activity strength with 324P's 2010 activity.

In Phase I, the detector will be loaded with 0.3% natural tellurium, corresponding to nearly 800 kg of 130Te, with an expected effective Majorana neutrino mass sensitivity in the region of 55-133 meV, just above the inverted mass hierarchy.

Using data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS), we measure the weighted-average ratio of the aligned projected ellipticity components of galaxy matter haloes and their embedded galaxies, $f_\mathrm{h}$, split by galaxy type. From CFHTLenS we find $f_\mathrm{h}=-0.04 \pm 0.25$ for early-type galaxies, which is consistent with current models for the galaxy-halo misalignment predicting $f_\mathrm{h}\simeq 0.20$. This can be compared to the simulated results which yield $f_\mathrm{h}\simeq 0.02$ for misaligned late-type models.

These measurements are consistent with the predictions of General Relativity, for a perturbed Friedmann-Robertson-Walker metric in a Universe dominated by a cosmological constant, which are E_G = 0.41 and 0.36 at these respective redshifts

Testing Modified Gravity with Cosmic Shear (Joachim Harnois-DÃ©raps - 20 June, 2015)
We use the cosmic shear data from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey to place constraints on $f(R)$ and {\it Generalized Dilaton} models of modified gravity. This is highly complimentary to other probes since the constraints mainly come from the non-linear scales: maximal deviations with respects to the General-Relativity + $Î$CDM scenario occurs at $k\sim1 h \mbox{Mpc}^{-1}$. Confronted against the cosmic shear data, we reject the $f(R)$ $\{ |f_{R_0}|=10^{-4}, n=1\}$ model with more than 99.9% confidence interval (CI) when assuming a $Î$CDM dark matter only model. In the presence of baryonic feedback processes and massive neutrinos with total mass up to 0.2eV, the model is disfavoured with at least 94% CI in all different combinations studied. Constraints on the $\{ |f_{R_0}|=10^{-4}, n=2\}$ model are weaker, but nevertheless disfavoured with at least 89% CI

The majority of the clones of the three resonant objects (>90%) spend a total of 10^7 years in resonance during their 4.5 Gyr integrations; most clones experience multiple periods of resonance capture. Given our orbit model, the intrinsic population necessary for the detection of these three objects in the 5:1 resonance is 1900(+3300 -1400, 95% confidence) with H_g< 8 and e > 0.5.

Space Warps: I. Crowd-sourcing the Discovery of Gravitational Lenses (Philip J. Marshall - 1 September, 2015)
Having divided 160 square degrees of Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) imaging into some 430,000 overlapping 82 by 82 arcsecond tiles and displaying them on the site, we were joined by around 37,000 volunteers who contributed 11 million image classifications over the course of 8 months. This Stage 1 search reduced the sample to 3381 images containing candidates; these were then refined in Stage 2 to yield a sample that we expect to be over 90% complete and 30% pure, based on our analysis of the volunteers performance on training images. We comment on the scalability of the SpaceWarps system to the wide field survey era, based on our projection that searches of 10$^5$ images could be performed by a crowd of 10$^5$ volunteers in 6 days.

Cross-correlation of Planck CMB Lensing and CFHTLenS Galaxy Weak Lensing Maps (Jia Liu - 1 October, 2015)
We cross-correlate cosmic microwave background (CMB) lensing and galaxy weak lensing maps using the Planck 2013 and 2015 data and the 154 deg^2 Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). Using the noise properties of these data sets and standard Planck 2015 LCDM cosmological parameters, we forecast a signal-to-noise ratio ~4.6 for the cross-correlation. The best-fit amplitudes of our measured cross-correlations are $A_{2013}=0.48\pm0.26$ and $A_{2015}=0.44\pm0.22$ using the 2013 and 2015 Planck CMB lensing maps, respectively, where $A=1$ corresponds to the fiducial Planck 2015 LCDM prediction. The tension is reduced somewhat when compared to predictions using WMAP9 parameters, for which we find $A_{2013}=0.56\pm0.30$ and $A_{2015}=0.52\pm0.26$. We consider various systematic effects, finding that photometric redshift uncertainties, contamination by intrinsic alignments, and effects due to the masking of galaxy clusters in the Planck 2015 CMB lensing reconstruction are able to help resolve the tension at a significant level (~10% each)

A Search for Intergalactic Globular Clusters in the Local Group (Graziella di Tullio Zinn - 10 March, 2015)
Visual examination of their SDSS images recovered 84 percent of the confirmed GCs in M31 and M33 and yielded 17 new GC candidates, 5 of them of high confidence, which we could confirm as GCs in MegaPrime images from the Canada, France, Hawaii Telescope. These 5 GCs are within M31's halo, but the other 12 candidates are not close to LG galaxies or galaxies within 3 Mpc of the LG. Even though this search covers only one-third of the sky and some GCs could have been missed, it suggests that the LG does not contain a large population of IGCs more luminous than Mv ~ -6

The M-dwarfs in Multiples (MinMs) survey - I. Stellar multiplicity among low-mass stars within 15 pc (K. Ward-Duong - 2 March, 2015)
Infrared adaptive optics (AO) data were analysed from the Very Large Telescope, Subaru Telescope, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, and MMT Observatory to detect close companions to the sample from $\sim$1 au to 100 au, while digitised wide-field archival plates were searched for wide companions from $\sim$100 au to 10,000 au. With sensitivity to the bottom of the main sequence over a separation range of 3 au to 10,000 au, multiple AO and wide-field epochs allow us to confirm candidates with common proper motions, minimize background contamination, and enable a measurement of comprehensive binary statistics. We detected 65 co-moving stellar companions and find a companion star fraction of $23.5 \pm 3.2$ per cent over the 3 au to 10,000 au separation range. The mass ratio distribution across the $q = 0.2 - 1.0$ range is flat, similar to that of multiple systems with solar-type primaries

These observational evidence suggest that NGC 6791 is currently experiencing mass loss likely due to gravitational shocking and interactions with the tidal field.

CFHTLenS: A Gaussian likelihood is a sufficient approximation for a cosmological analysis of third-order cosmic shear statistics (P. Simon - 17 February, 2015)
We study the correlations of the shear signal between triplets of sources in the Canada-France-Hawaii Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) to probe cosmological parameters via the matter bispectrum. Applying this algorithm to the third-order correlations of shear alone in a blind analysis, we find a good agreement with the standard cosmological model: $Î£_8$=$Ï_8$ $(Î©_{\rm m}/0.27)^{0.64}$=$0.79^{+0.08}_{-0.11}$ for a flat $Î\rm CDM$ cosmology with $h=0.7\pm0.04$ ($68\%$ credible interval). Nevertheless our models provide only moderately good fits as indicated by $Ï^2/{\rm dof}=2.9$, including a $20\%$ r.m.s. The models cannot explain a signal drop on scales around 15 arcmin, which may be caused by systematics

Cross-Correlation of CFHTLenS Galaxy Number Density and Planck CMB Lensing (Y. Omori - 11 February, 2015)
We measure the cross-power spectrum between galaxy density from Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) catalogues and gravitational lensing convergence from Planck data release 1 (2013) and 2 (2015). We investigate three main galaxy samples: $18.0<i_{\rm AB}<22.0$, $18.0<i_{\rm AB}<23.0$, $18.0<i_{\rm AB}<24.0$ in the redshift range $0.2<z<1.3$ in each of the four CFHTLenS wide fields. By comparing the measured cross-spectrum with model predictions, linear galaxy-dark matter biases of $b=0.82^{+0.24}_{-0.23}, 0.83^{+0.19}_{-0.18}, 0.82^{+0.16}_{-0.14}$ are inferred at significances of $3.5, 4.5, 5.6Ï$ using the Planck 2015 release.

Discovery of a Centrifugal Magnetosphere Around the He-Strong Magnetic B1 Star ALS 3694 (Matt Shultz - 10 November, 2014)
We report the results of 6 nights of Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope spectropolarimetric ESPaDOnS observations of the He-strong, magnetic B1 type star ALS 3694. The longitudinal magnetic field is approximately 2 kG in all 6 observations, showing essentially no variation between nights. The H$Î±$ line displays variable emission on all nights, peaking at high velocities ($\sim 3 v\sin{i}$). Given the presence of a strong ($B_{\rm d}>$6 kG) magnetic field, and the similarity of the emission profile to that of other magnetic B-type stars, we interpret the emission as a consequence of a centrifugal magnetosphere.

Forty-Seven Milky Way-Sized, Extremely Diffuse Galaxies in the Coma Cluster (Pieter van Dokkum - 9 January, 2015)
The objects have central surface brightness mu(g,0) ranging from 24 - 26 mag/arcsec^2 and effective radii r_e = 3"-10", as measured from archival Canada France Hawaii Telescope images. This relatively large distance is surprising as it implies that the galaxies are very large: with r_e = 1.5 - 4.6 kpc their sizes are similar to those of L* galaxies even though their median stellar mass is only ~6 x 10^7 Solar masses. The galaxies are relatively red and round, with <g-i> = 0.8 and <b/a> = 0.74. One of the 47 galaxies is fortuitously covered by a deep Hubble Space Telescope ACS observation. The ACS imaging shows a large spheroidal object with a central surface brightness mu(g,0) = 25.8 mag/arcsec^2, a Sersic index n=0.6, and an effective radius of 7", corresponding to 3.4 kpc at the distance of Coma

CFHTLenS: A Weak Lensing Shear Analysis of the 3D-Matched-Filter Galaxy Clusters (Jes Ford - 9 December, 2014)
We present the cluster mass-richness scaling relation calibrated by a weak lensing analysis of >18000 galaxy cluster candidates in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS). Detected using the 3D-Matched-Filter cluster-finder of Milkeraitis et al., these cluster candidates span a wide range of masses, from the small group scale up to $\sim10^{15} M_{\odot}$, and redshifts 0.2 $\lesssim z\lesssim$ 0.9. The total significance of the stacked shear measurement amounts to 54$Ï$. We compare cluster masses determined using weak lensing shear and magnification, finding the measurements in individual richness bins to yield 1$Ï$ compatibility, but with magnification estimates biased low. In addition, we confirm analyses that suggest cluster miscentring has an important effect on the observed 3D-MF halo profiles, and we quantify this by fitting for projected cluster centroid offsets, which are typically $\sim$ 0.4 arcmin. We bin the cluster candidates as a function of redshift, finding similar cluster masses and richness across the full range up to $z \sim$ 0.9. We measure the 3D-MF mass-richness scaling relation $M_{200} = M_0 (N_{200} / 20)^Î²$. We find a normalization $M_0 \sim (2.7^{+0.5}_{-0.4}) \times 10^{13} M_{\odot}$, and a logarithmic slope of $Î²\sim 1.4 \pm 0.1$, both of which are in 1$Ï$ agreement with results from the magnification analysis

Stacked weak lensing signals are detected significantly for 8 subsamples of the SDSS clusters divided by redshift and richness bins, which are then compared with model predictions including miscentring effects to constrain mean halo masses of individual bins. We find the richness correlates well with the halo mass, such that the corrected richness limit of 20 corresponds to the cluster virial mass limit of about 1 \times 10^14 M_Sun/h for the SDSS DR8 cluster sample.

The longitudinal magnetic field in the grand average profile was measured to be $-0.24 \pm 0.32 $ G, as compared to $-0.22 \pm 0.32$ G in the null profile. Secondly, we compare the grand average profile with calculations corresponding to the random magnetic spot topologies of Kochukhov & Sudnik (2013), inferring that spots, if present, of 2 degrees radius with strengths of 2-4 G and a filling factor of 50% should have been detected in our data. 2010) computed for the spectral characteristics of $Î¹$ Her.

The effective temperature of the gas is found to be in the range ($7\times10^{5}$--$3 \times10^{8}$)\,K, with approximately $50\%$ of the baryons appearing to lie beyond the virial radius of the halos, consistent with current expectations for the warm-hot intergalactic medium.

Strong Brightness Variations Signal Cloudy-to-Clear Transition of Brown Dwarfs (Jacqueline Radigan - 5 June, 2014)
[ABRIDGED] We report the results of a $J$ band search for cloud-related variability in the atmospheres of 62 L4-T9 dwarfs using the Du Pont 2.5-m telescope at Las Campanas Observatory and the Canada France Hawaii Telescope on Mauna Kea. We find 9 of 57 objects included in our final analysis to be significantly variable with >99% confidence, 5 of which are new discoveries. In our study, strong sinusoidal signals (peak-to-peak amplitudes >2%) are confined to the L/T transition (4/16 objects with L9-T3.5 spectral types and 0/41 objects for all other spectral types). The probability that the observed occurrence rates for strong variability inside and outside the L/T transition originate from the same underlying true occurrence rate is excluded with >99.7% confidence. Outside the L/T transition we identify 5 weak variables (peak-to-peak amplitudes of 0.6%-1.6%). Excluding L9-T3.5 spectral types, we infer that $60^{+22}_{-18}$% of targets vary with amplitudes of 0.5%$-$1.6%, suggesting that surface heterogeneities are common among L and T dwarfs. Our survey establishes a significant link between strong variability and L/T transition spectral types, providing evidence in support of the hypothesis that cloud holes contribute to the abrupt decline in condensate opacity and 1 micron brightening observed in this regime

RingFinder: automated detection of galaxy-scale gravitational lenses in ground-based multi-filter imaging data (Raphael Gavazzi - 5 March, 2014)
The method is automated for efficient application to current and future surveys, having originally been designed for the 150-deg2 Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). For sources with magnification mu>4, RingFinder reaches 42% (resp. 25%) completeness and 29% (resp. 86%) purity before (resp. The completeness of RingFinder is substantially improved in the particular range of Einstein radii 0.8 < REin < 2. and lensed images brighter than g = 22.5, where it can be as high as 70%. From an initial sample of 640,000 early type galaxies, RingFinder returns 2500 candidates, which we further reduce by visual inspection to 330 candidates. We confirm 33 new gravitational lenses from the main sample of candidates, plus an additional 16 systems taken from earlier versions of RingFinder

A 10 deg$^2$ Lyman-$Î±$ survey at z=8.8 with spectroscopic follow-up: strong constraints on the LF and implications for other surveys (Jorryt Matthee - 26 February, 2014)
In order to overcome such limitations, we have undertaken the CF-HiZELS survey, which is a large area, medium depth near infrared narrow-band survey targeted at $z=8.8$ Lyman-$Î±$ (Ly$Î±$) emitters (LAEs) and covering 10 deg$^2$ in part of the SSA22 field with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We surveyed a comoving volume of $4.7\times 10^6$ Mpc$^3$ to a Ly$Î±$ luminosity limit of $6.3\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. We look for Ly$Î±$ candidates by applying the following criteria: i) clear emission line source, ii) no optical detections ($ugriz$ from CFHTLS), iii) no visible detection in the optical stack ($ugriz > 27$), iv) visually checked reliable NB$_J$ and $J$ detections and v) $J-K \leq 0$. We compute photometric redshifts and remove a significant amount of dusty lower redshift line-emitters at $z \sim 1.4 $ or $2.2$. A total of 13 Ly$Î±$ candidates were found, of which two are marked as strong candidates, but the majority have very weak constraints on their SEDs. We put a strong constraint on the Ly$Î±$ luminosity function at $z \sim 9$ and make realistic predictions for ongoing and future surveys

Dissecting the Red Sequence: The Bulge and Disc Colours of Early-Type Galaxies in the Coma Cluster (Jacob T. C. G. Head - 19 February, 2014)
We present the 2D bulge-disc decomposition of galaxies in deep Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope $u,g,i$ imaging using GALFIT. Rigorous filtering is applied to identify an analysis sample of 200 galaxies which are well described by an `archetypal' S0 structure (central bulge + outer disc). Gradients are required for $30\%$ of analysis sample galaxies. Bulge half-light radii are found to be uncorrelated with galaxy luminosity ($R_e \sim 1$ kpc, $n\sim2$) for all but the brightest galaxies ($M_g<-20.5$)

The SLUGGS Survey: New evidence for a tidal interaction between the early type galaxies NGC 4365 and NGC 4342 (Christina Blom - 20 January, 2014)
Using imaging from the MegaCam instrument on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) we identify a stream of GCs between the two galaxies and extending beyond NGC 4342. We find that the photometric colours of the stream GCs match those associated with NGC 4342, and that the recession velocity of the combined GCs from the stream and NGC 4342 match the recession velocity for NGC 4342 itself. These results suggest that NGC 4342 is being stripped of GCs (and stars) as it undergoes a tidal interaction with the nearby elliptical galaxy NGC 4365. We compare NGC 4342 to two well-known, tidally stripped galaxies (M32 and NGC 4486B) and find various similarities. (2012a) that NGC 4342 cannot be undergoing significant tidal stripping because it hosts a large dark matter halo.

A comparison of the detection rate from the NGVS and the PDSSS (a characterized survey that `re-discovered' the IOC object Sedna) gives, for an assumed a power-law LF for IOC objects, a slope of $Î±\simeq 0.7 \pm 0.2$, with only two detections in this region this slope estimate is highly uncertain.

The sample is based on the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey (SL2S), a systematic search of strong lensing systems in the photometric Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). Among 126 candidates, we obtain a weak lensing detection for 89 objects with velocity dispersions of the Singular Isothermal Sphere mass model ranging from 350 to 1000 km/s with an average value of 600km/s, corresponding to a rich galaxy group (or poor cluster). From the galaxies belonging to the bright end of the group's red sequence (M_i<-21), we derive the optical properties of the SARCS candidates. We obtain typical richnesses of N=5-15 galaxies and optical luminosities of L=0.5-1.5e+12 Lsol (within a radius of 0.5 Mpc). We finally combine the lensing and optical analyses to draw a sample of 80 most secure group candidates, i.e. We detect the expected correlations over the probed range in mass with a typical scatter of 25% in the SIS velocity dispersion at a given richness or luminosity, making these scaling laws interesting mass proxies

Andromeda Optical and Infrared Disk Survey I. New Insights in Wide-Field Near-IR Surface Photometry (Jonathan Sick - 25 March, 2013)
We present wide-field near-infrared J and Ks images of the Andromeda Galaxy taken with WIRCam on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) as part of the Andromeda Optical and Infrared Disk Survey (ANDROIDS). This necessitates sky-target nodding across 27 WIRCam fields. Two sky-target nodding strategies were tested, and we find that strictly minimizing sky sampling latency does not maximize sky subtraction accuracy, which is at best 2% of the sky level. The mean surface brightness difference between blocks in our mosaic can be reduced from 1% to 0.1% of the sky brightness by introducing scalar sky offsets to each image. The true surface brightness of M31 can be known to within a statistical zeropoint of 0.15% of the sky level (0.2 mag arcsec sq. To overcome flat field variability of order 1% over 30 minutes, we find that WIRCam data should be calibrated with real-time sky flats. Due either to atmospheric or instrumental variations, the individual WIRCam frames have typical residual shapes with amplitudes of 0.2% of the sky after real-time flat fielding and median sky subtraction

CFHTLenS spans 154 square degrees in five optical bands, with accurate shear and photometric redshifts for a galaxy sample with a median redshift of zm =0.70. We estimate the 21 sets of cosmic shear correlation functions associated with six redshift bins, each spanning the angular range of 1.5<theta<35 arcmin. This leads to constraints on the normalisation of the matter power spectrum sigma_8 = 0.799 +/- 0.015 and the matter density parameter Omega_m = 0.271 +/- 0.010 for a flat Lambda CDM cosmology. For a flat wCDM cosmology we constrain the dark energy equation of state parameter w = -1.02 +/- 0.09

On the density profile of the globular cluster M92 (A. Di Cecco - 7 February, 2013)
These profiles are calculated from optical images collected with the CCD mosaic camera MegaCam at the Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope and with the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the Hubble Space Telescope. By examining the contour levels of the number density, we found that the stellar distribution becomes clumpy at radial distances larger than about 13 arcminutes, and there is no preferred orientation of contours in space

The Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey: 1.2mm Observations (A. Omont - 28 January, 2013)
We report 250 GHz (1.2 mm) observations of a sample of 20 QSOs at redshifts 5.8<z<6.5 from the the Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey (CFHQS), using the Max-Planck Millimeter Bolometer (MAMBO) array at the IRAM 30-metre telescope. A rms sensitivity <~ 0.6 mJy was achieved for 65% of the sample, and <~ 1.0 mJy for 90%. Only one QSO, CFHQS J142952+544717, was robustly detected with S_250GHz = 3.46 +/-0.52 mJy. On average, the other CFHQS QSOs, which have a mean optical magnitude fainter than previously studied SDSS samples of z~6 QSOs, have a mean 1.2 mm flux density <S_250GHz> = 0.41 +/-0.14 mJy; such a 2.9-sigma average detection is hardly meaningful. It would correspond to <L_FIR> ~ 0.94+/-0.32 10^12 Lo, and an average star formation rate of a few 100's Mo/yr, depending on the IMF and a possible AGN contribution to <L_FIR>

The puzzling merging cluster Abell 1914: new insights from the kinematics of member galaxies (R. Barrena - 22 January, 2013)
We also use photometry Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope archives. We compute the mean cluster redshift, <z>=0.168, and the velocity dispersion which shows a high value, sigma_v=1210_{-110}^{+125} km/s. From the 2D analysis we find that Abell 1914 has a NE-SW elongated structure with two galaxy clumps, that mostly merge in the plane of the sky. We estimate a virial mass M_sys=1.4--2.6 10^{15} h_{70}^{-1} Msun for the whole system. By studying the 2D distribution of the red galaxies, photometrically selected, we show that Abell 1914 is contained in a rich large scale structure, with two close companion galaxy systems, known to be at z~0.17. We conclude that Abell 1914 well fits among typical clusters with radio halos. We argue that the unusual radio emission is connected to the complex cluster accretion and suggest that Abell 1914 resembles the well-known nearby merging cluster Abell 754 for its particular observed phenomenology.

Faint Tidal Features in Galaxies within the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey Wide Fields (Adam M. Atkinson - 20 January, 2013)
We present an analysis of the detectability of faint tidal features in galaxies from the wide-field component of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey. Our sample consists of 1781 luminous M_r<-19.3 mag) galaxies in the magnitude range 15.5<r<17 mag and in the redshift range 0.04<z<0.2. We find that around 12% of the galaxies in our sample show clear tidal features at the highest confidence level. This fraction rises to about 18% if we include systems with convincing albeit weaker tidal features, and to 26% if we include systems with more marginal features that may or may not be tidal in origin

We construct a volume-limited sample of galaxies that contains more than one million galaxies in the redshift range 0.2<z<1 distributed over the four independent fields of the CFHTLS. We use a counts in cells technique to measure the variance <xi_2> and the hierarchical moments S_n = <xi_n>/<xi_2>^(n-1) (3<n<5) as a function of redshift and angular scale.The robustness of our measurements if thoroughly tested, and the field-to-field scatter is in very good agreement with analytical predictions

CFHTLenS: Higher-order galaxy-mass correlations probed by galaxy-galaxy-galaxy lensing (P. Simon - 9 January, 2013)
We apply our method to the state-of-the-art Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS), spanning 154 square degrees. A significant dependence of the normalised G3L statistics on luminosity within -23<M_r<-18 and stellar mass within 5x10^9 M_sol<M_star<2x10^11 M_sol is found (h=0.73). Importantly, we find the excess mass to be very sensitive to galaxy type as recently predicted with semi-analytic galaxy models: luminous (M_r<-21) late-type galaxies show no detectable signal, while all excess mass detected for luminous galaxies seems to be associated with early-type galaxies

CFHTLenS: Testing the Laws of Gravity with Tomographic Weak Lensing and Redshift Space Distortions (Fergus Simpson - 7 October, 2015)
We perform such an analysis by combining measurements of cosmic shear tomography from the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope Lensing Survey (CFHTLenS) with the growth of structure from the WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey and the Six-degree-Field Galaxy Survey (6dFGS), producing the strongest existing joint constraints on the metric potentials that describe general theories of gravity. For scale-independent modifications to the metric potentials which evolve linearly with the effective dark energy density, we find present-day cosmological deviations in the Newtonian potential and curvature potential from the prediction of General Relativity to be (Delta Psi)/Psi = 0.05 \pm 0.25 and (Delta Phi)/Phi = -0.05 \pm 0.3 respectively (68 per cent CL).

With the discovery of the first exoplanet in 1992, more than 800 have been detected since. Our simulation is based on 2695 stars distributed over the entire sky. Kepler data indicate that at minimum 34% of all stars are orbited by at least one of five different planetary sizes: Earth, Super-Earth, Uranus, Jupiter and Super-Jupiter. Depending on the duty cycle and duration of the observations, about six planets should be detectable in 180 days, of which about five of them being of Jupiter size.

Spectroscopy of brown dwarf candidates in IC 348 and the determination of its substellar IMF down to planetary masses (C. Alves de Oliveira - 16 November, 2012)
Deep optical and near-IR images taken with MegaCam and WIRCam at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) were used to select photometric candidate members. We confirmed spectroscopically 16 new members of the IC 348 cluster, including 13 brown dwarfs, contributing significantly to the substellar census of the cluster, where only 30 brown dwarfs were previously known. At 3 Myr, evolutionary models estimate these brown dwarfs to have a mass of ~13 Jupiter masses. Combining the new members with previous census of the cluster, we constructed the IMF complete down to 13 Jupiter masses. The IMF of IC 348 is well fitted by a log-normal function, and we do not see evidence for variations of the mass function down to planetary masses when compared to other young clusters.

Discovery of a magnetic field in the rapidly-rotating O-type secondary of the colliding-wind binary HD 47129 (Plaskett's star) (J. H. Grunhut - 27 September, 2012)
Eight independent Stokes $V$ observations were acquired using the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope and the Narval spectropolarimeter at the TÃ©lescope Bernard Lyot. Using Least-Squares Deconvolution we obtain definite detections of signal in Stokes $V$ in 3 observations. The longitudinal field of the secondary is variable and exhibits extreme values of $-810\pm 150$ G and $+680\pm 190$ G, implying a minimum surface dipole polar strength of $2850\pm 500$ G. In contrast, we derive an upper limit ($3Ï$) to the primary's surface magnetic field of 230 G. We conclude that HD 47129 represents a heretofore unique stellar system - a close, massive binary with a rapidly rotating, magnetized component - that will be a rich target for further study.

Through aperture photometry we observed the in- ner coma (within 2500 km of the nucleus) to fade from an apparent magnitude of 11.7 mag to 17.6 mag, corresponding to absolute magnitudes of 8.1 mag and 12.4 mag, between UT 2007 Nov. 6 and 2008 Feb. 12. A second much smaller outburst occurred on UT 2007 Nov. 12, three weeks after the original outburst, suggesting that the nucleus remained unstable. The surface brightness profile of the inner coma was consistently shallow relative to the expected steady-state profile, and showed a persistent brightness enhancement within ~ 5000 km of the nucleus

Search for 28Si cluster states through the 12C+16O radiative capture (S. Courtin - 27 July, 2012)

The most remarquable result is the previously unobserved decay path through 28Si doorway states of energies around 12 MeV leading to the measurement of new capture cross-sections. The feeding of specific, deformed states in 28Si from the resonances is discussed, as well as the selective feeding of 1^+ T=1 states around 11 MeV.

Evolution in the Volumetric Type Ia Supernova Rate from the Supernova Legacy Survey (K. Perrett - 4 June, 2012)

This analysis includes 286 spectroscopically confirmed and more than 400 additional photometrically identified SNe Ia within the redshift range 0.1<z<1.1. Finally, we split the SNLS sample into two populations by the light curve width (stretch), and show that the general behavior in the rates of faster-declining SNe Ia (0.8<s<1.0) is similar, within our measurement errors, to that of the slower objects (1.0<s<1.3) out to z~0.8.

We find the rate of Type II supernovae within the virial radius of these galaxy clusters to be 0.026 (+0.085 -0.018 stat; +0.003 -0.001 sys) SNe per century per 1e10 solar masses.

We find that for all galaxy types, sSFR is 5.1 (+15.8 -3.1 stat; +0.9 -0.9 sys) solar masses per year per 1e12 solar masses, and for red sequence galaxies only, it is 2.0 (+4.2 -0.9 stat; +0.4 -0.4 sys) solar masses per year per 1e12 solar masses

The Discovery of an Ultra-Faint Star Cluster in the Constellation of Ursa Minor (Ricardo R. Munoz - 25 April, 2012)
We report the discovery of a new ultra-faint globular cluster in the constellation of Ursa Minor, based on stellar photometry from the MegaCam imager at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). We find that this cluster, Munoz 1, is located at a distance of 45 +/- 5 kpc and at a projected distance of only 45 arcmin from the center of the Ursa Minor dSph galaxy. Using a Maximum Likelihood technique we measure a half-light radius of 0.5 arcmin, or equivalently 7 pc and an ellipticity consistent with being zero. We estimate its absolute magnitude to be M_V=-0.4 +/- 0.9, which corresponds to L_V=120 (+160, -65) L_sun and we measure a heliocentric radial velocity of -137 +/- 4 km/s based on Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopy. This new satellite is separate from Ursa Minor by ~30 kpc and 110 km/s suggesting the cluster is not obviously associated with the dSph, despite the very close angular separation. Based on its photometric properties and structural parameters we conclude that Munoz 1 is a new ultra-faint stellar cluster. Along with Segue 3 this is one of the faintest stellar clusters known to date.

Constraints on Massive Neutrinos from the CFHTLS Angular Power Spectrum (Jun-Qing Xia - 22 March, 2012)
We use the galaxy angular power spectrum at $z\sim0.5-1.2$ from the Canada-France-Hawaii-Telescope Legacy Survey Wide fields (CFHTLS-Wide) to constrain separately the total neutrino mass $\sum{m_Î½}$ and the effective number of neutrino species $N_{\rm{eff}}$. We show that CFHTLS, combined with WMAP7 and a prior on the Hubble constant provides an upper limit of $\sum{m_Î½}<0.29\,$eV and $N_{\rm{eff}} =4.17^{+1.62}_{-1.26}$ (2$\,Ï$ confidence levels). If we omit smaller scales which may be affected by non-linearities, these constraints become $\sum{m_Î½}<0.41\,$eV and $N_{\rm{eff}} =3.98^{+2.02}_{-1.20}$ (2$\,Ï$ confidence levels)

We analyze deep g' and r' band data of 97 galaxy clusters imaged with MegaCam on the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope. Due to excellent image quality and uniformity of the data and analysis, we probe the giant-to-dwarf ratio (GDR) out to z ~ 0.55. Our measurements support an evolving GDR over the redshift range 0.05 < z < 0.55. We parameterize the GDR evolution using a linear function of redshift (GDR = alpha * z + beta) with a best fit slope of alpha = 0.88 +/- 0.15 and normalization beta = 0.44 +/- 0.03. Lastly, the data suggest that the evolution of the GDR at z < 0.2 is driven primarily by dry merging of the massive giant galaxies, which when considered with previous results at higher redshift, suggests a change in the dominant mechanism that mediates the GDR.

The SL2S Galaxy-scale Gravitational Lens Sample. I. The alignment of mass and light in massive early-type galaxies at z=0.2-0.9 (Raphael Gavazzi - 29 November, 2012)
The sample was identified from deep multi-band images obtained as part of the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey as part of the Strong Lensing Legacy Survey (SL2S). Higher resolution follow-up imaging is available for a subset of 10 systems. By comparison with the observed distribution of light we infer that there is a substantial amount of external shear with mean value $<Î³_{\rm ext}>= 0.12 \pm 0.05$, arising most likely from the environment of the SL2S lenses

The Hawaii Infrared Parallax Program. I. Ultracool Binaries and the L/T Transition (Trent J. Dupuy - 9 June, 2012)
We present the first results from our high-precision infrared (IR) astrometry program at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. We measure parallaxes for 83 ultracool dwarfs (spectral types M6--T9) in 49 systems, with a median uncertainty of 1.1 mas (2.3%) and as good as 0.7 mas (0.8%). We provide the first parallaxes for 48 objects in 29 systems, and for another 27 objects in 17 systems, we significantly improve upon published results, with a median (best) improvement of 1.7x (5x). This wavelength dependence is consistent with cloud clearing over a narrow range of temperature, since condensate opacity is expected to dominate at 1.0--1.3 micron. This "L/T gap" occurs at MKO(J-H) = 0.1--0.3 mag, MKO(J-K) = 0.0--0.4 mag, and implies that the last phases of cloud evolution occur rapidly. Finally, we provide a comprehensive update to the absolute magnitudes of ultracool dwarfs as a function of spectral type using a combined sample of 314 objects.

Short and Long Range Population Dynamics of the Monarch (Komi Messan - 16 December, 2011)
The monarch butterfly annually migrates from central Mexico to southern Canada. In Stage 1, we propose a system of coupled ordinary differential equations that model the populations of the monarch butterflies and larvae during spring migration. In Stage 2, we propose a predator-prey model with age structure to model the population dynamics at the summer breeding site. In Stages 3 and 4, we propose exponential decay functions to model the monarch butterfly's fall migration to central Mexico and their time at the overwintering site

Astronomical Sky Quality Near Eureka, in the Canadian High Arctic (Eric Steinbring - 13 December, 2011)
Nighttime visible-light sky brightness and transparency are reported for the Polar Environment Research Laboratory (PEARL), located on a 610-m high ridge near the Eureka research station, on Ellesmere Island, Canada. These data show that during the period of the study, October through March of 2008/09 and 2009/10, the sky near zenith had a mean surface brightness of 19.7 mag/square-arcsec when the sun was more than 12 deg below the horizon, reaching 20.7 mag/square-arcsec during astronomical darkness with no moon. Skies were without thick cloud and potentially usable for astronomy 86% of the time (extinction <2 mag). Up to 68% of the time was spectroscopic (<0.5 mag), attenuated by ice crystals, or clear with stable atmospheric transparency. Those conditions can persist for over 100 hours at a time

Utilizing Astroinformatics to Maximize the Science Return of the Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey (Nicholas M. Ball - 25 October, 2011)
The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey is a 104 square degree survey of the Virgo Cluster, carried out using the MegaPrime camera of the Canada-France-Hawaii telescope, from semesters 2009A-2012A. The limiting magnitude of the survey is g_AB = 25.7 (10 sigma point source), and the 2 sigma surface brightness limit is g_AB ~ 29 mag arcsec^-2. The data volume of the survey (approximately 50 terabytes of images), while large by contemporary astronomical standards, is not intractable. The enormous dynamic range of objects, from the giant elliptical galaxy M87 at M(B) = -21.6, to the faintest dwarf ellipticals at M(B) ~ -6, combined with photometry in 5 broad bands (u* g' r' i' z'), and unprecedented depth revealing many previously unseen structures, creates new challenges in object detection and classification

The impact of high spatial frequency atmospheric distortions on weak lensing measurements (Catherine Heymans - 1 December, 2011)
We analyse dense stellar fields imaged at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope to quantify the degree of high spatial frequency variation in ground-based imaging Point Spread Functions and compare our results to models of atmospheric turbulence. We find the amplitude of the high spatial frequencies to decrease with increasing exposure time as $t^{-1/2}$, and find a negligibly small atmospheric contribution to the Point Spread Function ellipticity variation for exposure times $t>180$ seconds. For future surveys analysing shorter exposure data, this anisotropic turbulence will need to be taken into account as the amplitude of the correlated atmospheric distortions becomes comparable to a cosmological lensing signal on scales less than $\sim 10$ arcminutes. This effect could be mitigated, however, by correlating galaxy shear measured on exposures imaged with a time separation greater than 50 seconds, for which we find the spatial turbulence patterns to be uncorrelated.

The Canada-France Ecliptic Plane Survey - Full Data Release: The orbital structure of the Kuiper belt (Jean-Marc Petit - 24 August, 2011)
We report the orbital distribution of the trans-neptunian objects (TNOs) discovered during the Canada-France Ecliptic Plane Survey, whose discovery phase ran from early 2003 until early 2007. The follow-up observations started just after the first discoveries and extended until late 2009. We obtained characterized observations of 321 sq.deg. of sky to depths in the range g ~ 23.5--24.4 AB mag. We provide a database of 169 TNOs with high-precision dynamical classification and known discovery efficiency. The main classical belt (a=40--47 AU) needs to be modeled with at least three components: the `hot' component with a wide inclination distribution and two `cold' components (stirred and kernel) with much narrower inclination distributions. With 95% confidence, there are 8000+1800-1600 objects in the main belt with Hg <= 8.0, of which 50% are from the hot component, 40% from the stirred component and 10% from the kernel; the hot component's fraction drops rapidly with increasing Hg. The Hg <= 8.0 TNO population estimates are 400 for the inner belt and 10,000 for the outer belt within a factor of two.

Weak lensing measurement of galaxy clusters in the CFHTLS-Wide survey (HuanYuan Shan - 31 January, 2012)
We present the first weak gravitational lensing analysis of the completed Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS). We study the 64 square degrees W1 field, the largest of the CFHTLS-Wide survey fields, and present the largest contiguous weak lensing convergence "mass map" yet made. 2.66 million galaxy shapes are measured, using a KSB pipeline verified against high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope imaging that covers part of the CFHTLS. The reconstructed lensing convergence map contains 301 peaks with signal-to-noise ratio Î½>3.5, consistent with predictions of a ÎCDM model. Of these peaks, 126 lie within 3.0' of a BCG identified from multicolor optical imaging in an independent, red sequence survey. We also identify 7 counterparts for massive clusters previously seen in X-ray emission within 6 square degrees XMM-LSS survey. Matching these to the optical observations, we confirm 85 groups/clusters with Ï^2 reduced < 3.0, at a mean redshift <z_c> = 0.36 and velocity dispersion <Ï_c> = 658.8 km/s

Mining the CFHT Legacy Survey for known Near Earth Asteroids (O. Vaduvescu - 12 July, 2011)
The Canada-France-Hawaii Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) comprising about 25 000 MegaCam images was data mined to search for serendipitous encounters of known Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) and Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). A total of 143 asteroids (109 NEAs and 34 PHAs) were found on 508 candidate images which were field corrected and measured carefully, and their astrometry was reported to Minor Planet Centre. Both recoveries and precoveries (apparitions before discovery) were reported, including data for 27 precovered asteroids (20 NEAs and 7 PHAs) and 116 recovered asteroids (89 NEAs and 27 PHAs). Our data prolonged arcs for 41 orbits at first or last opposition, refined 35 orbits by fitting data taken at one new opposition, recovered 6 NEAs at their second opposition and allowed us to ameliorate most orbits and their Minimal Orbital Intersection Distance (MOID), an important parameter to monitor for potential Earth impact hazard in the future.

Palomar 14 is the third system in the Galaxy (in addition to OmegaCentauri and NGC 2419) showing a population of BSS not centrally segregated. This is the most direct evidence that in Palomar 14 two-body relaxation has not fully established energy equipartition yet, even in the central regions (in agreement with the estimated half-mass relaxation time, which is significantly larger than the cluster age)

This paper reports high-precision Stokes V spectra of HD 191612 acquired using the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, in the context of the Magnetism in Massive stars (MiMeS) Project. We confirm the presence of a strong magnetic field in the photosphere of HD 191612, and detect its variability. We establish that the longitudinal field varies in a manner consistent with the spectroscopic period of 537.6 d, in an approximately sinusoidal fashion. Interpreting the variation of the longitudinal magnetic field within the context of the dipole oblique rotator model we obtain a best-fit surface magnetic field model with obliquity beta=67\pm 5 deg and polar strength Bd=2450\pm 400 G

Extended Star Clusters in the Remote Halo of the Intriguing Dwarf Galaxy NGC 6822 (Narae Hwang - 15 June, 2011)
We present a study on four new star clusters discovered in the halo of the intriguing dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 6822 from a wide field survey covering 3 deg x 3 deg area carried out with MegaCam at Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). The star clusters have extended structures with half-light radii R_h ~ 7.5 -- 14.0 pc, larger than typical Galactic globular clusters and other known globular clusters in NGC 6822. The integrated colors and color magnitude diagrams (CMD) of resolved stars suggest that the new star clusters are 2 -- 10 Gyr old and relatively metal poor with Z=0.0001--0.004 based on the comparison with theoretical models. The projected distance of each star cluster from the galaxy center ranges from 10.7 arcmin (~ 1.5 kpc) to 77 arcmin (~ 11 kpc), far beyond the optical body of the galaxy. Interestingly, the new star clusters are aligned along the elongated old stellar halo of NGC 6822, which is almost perpendicular to the HI gas distribution where young stellar populations exist. We discuss the stellar structure and evolution of NGC 6822 implied by these new extended star clusters in the halo. We also discuss the current status of observational and theoretical understandings regarding the origin of extended star clusters in NGC 6822 and other galaxies.

We find that the CO emission is consistent with a complete Einstein ring with a major axis diameter of ~ 1.4", indicative of lensing. The luminosity L'_CO(1-0) of the CO(1-0) emission is 2.71+/-0.38 x10^11/m K km s^-1 pc^2, and, adopting the commonly used conversion factor for ULIRGs, the molecular gas mass is M(H_2) = 2.2 x10^11/m M_sol, comparable to unlensed SMGs if corrected by m ~ 12. Our revised estimate of the far-IR luminosity of MM18423+5938 is 2 x10^13/m < L_FIR < 3 x10^14/m L_sol, comparable to that of ULIRGs

The Atlas-3D project - IX. The merger origin of a fast and a slow rotating Early-Type Galaxy revealed with deep optical imaging: first results (Pierre-Alain Duc - 27 May, 2011)
Our ultra deep optical images obtained with MegaCam on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope reach 29 mag/arcsec^2 in the g-band. Among them, a gigantic 160 kpc long tail East of NGC 5557 hosts gas-rich star-forming objects. NGC 680 exhibits two major diffuse plumes apparently connected to extended HI tails, as well as a series of arcs and shells. Comparing the outer stellar and gaseous morphology of the two ellipticals with that predicted from models of colliding galaxies, we argue that the LSB features are tidal debris, the star-forming objects near NGC 5557, long lived Tidal Dwarf Galaxies and that each of the two ETGs was assembled during a relatively recent, major wet merger, which likely occurred at a redshift below z = 0.5. The inner kinematics of NGC 680 is typical for fast rotators which make the bulk of nearby ETGs in the Atlas-3D sample. NGC 5557 belongs to the poorly populated class of massive, round, slow rotators that are predicted by semi-analytic models and cosmological simulations to be the end-product of a complex mass accretion history, involving ancient major mergers and more recent minor mergers

The NMBS catalogs contain ~13,000 galaxies at z>1.5 with accurate photometric redshifts and rest-frame colors. Due to the increased spectral resolution obtained with the five NIR medium-band filters, the median 68% confidence intervals of the photometric redshifts of both quiescent and star-forming galaxies are a factor of ~2 times smaller when comparing catalogs with medium-band NIR photometry to NIR broadband photometry

The infrared spectrum of the compact nebula can be described as a power law of index $Î±_{IR} = 0.7 \pm 0.3$, and suggests that the spectrum flattens between the infrared and X-ray bands.

Using photometric redshifts of galaxies, we identify 631 clusters from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) Wide field, 202 clusters from the CHFT Deep field, 187 clusters from the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) and 737 clusters from the Spitzer Wide-area InfraRed Extragalactic survey (SWIRE) field. The redshifts of these clusters are in the range of 0.1<z<1.6. Merging these cluster samples gives 1644 clusters in the four survey fields, of which 1088 are newly identified and more than half are from the large SWIRE field. Among 228 clusters of z>1, 191 clusters are newly identified, and most of them from the SWIRE field. The colors r'-z' and r^+-m_{3.6Î¼m} of the BCGs are consistent with a stellar population synthesis model in which the BCGs are formed at redshift z_f>2 and evolved passively. The colors g'-z' and B-m_{3.6Î¼m} of the BCGs at redshifts z>0.8 are systematically bluer than the passive evolution model for galaxy formed at z_f~2, indicating star formation in high redshift BCGs.

The X-ray detected non-BAL and BAL quasars have a mean observed X-ray-to-optical spectral slope of -1.47 +/- 0.13 and -1.66 +/- 0.17 respectively

The Space Density Evolution of Wet and Dry Mergers in the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (Richard C. Y. Chou - 7 December, 2010)
We analyze 1298 merging galaxies with redshifts up to z=0.7 from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey, taken from the catalog presented in Bridge et al. The evolution in the total merger rate is modest out to z ~ 0.7, although the wet and dry populations have different evolutionary trends. Since low-intermediate mass ellipticals are 10 --100 times more common than their most massive counterparts, the hierarchical explanation for the origin of early-type galaxies may be correct for the vast majority of early-types, even if incorrect for the most massive ones.

Martin Bradbury Wilk was born on December 18, 1922, in MontrÃ©al, QuÃ©bec, Canada. degree in Chemical Engineering in 1945 at McGill University and worked as a Research Engineer on the Atomic Energy Project for the National Research Council of Canada from 1945 to 1950. degree in Statistics in 1953 and 1955, respectively. After a one-year post-doc with John Tukey, he became Assistant Director of the Statistical Techniques Research Group at Princeton University in 1956--1957, and then served as Professor and Director of Research in Statistics at Rutgers University from 1959 to 1963. From 1956 to 1969, he was in turn Member of Technical Staff, Head of the Statistical Models and Methods Research Department, and Statistical Director in Management Sciences Research. In 1970, Martin moved into higher management levels of the American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T) Company. In 1980, he returned to Canada and became the first professional statistician to serve as Chief Statistician. He played a crucial role in the reinstatement of the Cabinet-cancelled 1986 Census.

Fiducial Stellar Population Sequences for the VJKs Photometric System (Crystal Brasseur - 1 October, 2010)
We have obtained broad-band near-infrared photometry for seven Galactic star clusters (M92, M15, M13, M5, NGC1851, M71 and NGC6791) using the WIRCam wide-field imager on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, supplemented by images of NGC1851 taken with HAWK-I on the VLT. In addition, 2MASS observations of the [Fe/H] ~ 0.0 open cluster M67 were added to the cluster database. From the resultant (V-J)-V and (V-Ks)-V colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs), fiducial sequences spanning the range in metallicity, -2.4 < [Fe/H] < +0.3, have been defined which extend (for most clusters) from the tip of the red-giant branch (RGB) to ~ 2.5 magnitudes below the main-sequence turnoff

The ratio between observed star counts (Mega-Cam data) across the tip of the RG branch and star counts predicted by Galactic models indicate a star count excess at least at a 3$Ï$ level up to 34-42\min\ from the center.

We have chosen the name of GYES, one of the mythological giants with one hundred arms, offspring of Gaia and Uranus, for our instrument study of a multifibre spectrograph for the prime focus of the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope. Building upon the experience gained at GEPI with FLAMES-Giraffe and X-Shooter, we are investigating the feasibility of a high multiplex spectrograph (about 500 fibres) over a field of view 1 degree in diameter. We are investigating an instrument with resolution in the range 15000 to 30000, which should provide accurate chemical abundances for stars down to 16th magnitude and radial velocities, accurate to 1 km/s for fainter stars. The conceptual study will be delivered to CFHT for review by October 1st 2010.

On the Detection of Two New Transneptunian Binaries from the CFEPS Kuiper Belt Survey (H. -W. Lin - 5 August, 2010)
We report here the discovery of an new near-equal mass Trans-Neptunian Binaries (TNBs) L5c02 and the and the putative detection of a second TNB (L4k12) among the year two and three detections of the Canada-France-Eclipic Plane Survey (CFEPS). These new binaries (internal designation L4k12 and L5c02) have moderate separations of 0.4" and 0.6" respectively. L4k12 has a heliocentric orbital inclination of ~ 35?degree, marking this system as having the highest heliocentric orbital inclination among known near-equal mass binaries. Based on the sample of objects searched we determine that the fraction of near-equal mass wide binaries with separations > 0.4" is 1.5% to 20% in the cold main classical Kuiper belt and, if our detection the binarity L4k12 holds, 3% to 43% in the hot main classical objects are binary

The catalog includes 599 new candidate stellar clusters, 204 previously confirmed clusters, 1,969 likely background galaxies and 218 unknown extended objects. Based on the properties of the confirmed star clusters, we select a sub-sample of highly probable clusters composed of 246 objects. The integrated photometry of the complete cluster catalog reveals a wide range of colors from -0.4 < (g-r) < 1.5 and -1.0 < (r-i) < 1.0 with no obvious cluster subpopulations. Comparisons with models of simple stellar populations suggest a large range of ages some as old as ~ 10 Gyrs.

We detect its thermal emission with an eclipse depth of 0.062 +/- 0.012% (5-sigma). Our best-fit secondary eclipse is consistent with a circular orbit (a 3-sigma upper limit on the eccentricity, e, and argument or periastron, omega, of |ecos(omega)| < 0.0090), in agreement with mid-infrared detections of the secondary eclipse of this planet. A secondary eclipse of this depth corresponds to a day-side Ks-band brightness temperature of TB = 1636 +/- 88 K. Our secondary eclipse has the smallest depth of any detected from the ground at around 2 micron to date.

Near-Infrared Properties of Metal-poor Globular Clusters in the Galactic Bulge Direction (S. -H. Chun - 19 April, 2010)
J, H, and K' images obtained from the near-infrared imager CFHTIR on the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope are used to derive the morphological parameters of the red giant branch (RGB) in the near-infrared color-magnitude diagrams for 12 metal-poor globular clusters in the Galactic bulge direction. Using the compiled data set of the RGB parameters for the observed 12 clusters, in addition to the previously studied 5 clusters, we discuss the properties of the RGB morphology for the clusters and compare them with the calibration relations for the metal-rich bulge clusters and the metal-poor halo clusters. The photometric RGB shape indices such as colors at fixed magnitudes of MK = MH = (-5.5, -5, -4, and -3), magnitudes at fixed colors of (J - K)o = (J - H)o = 0.7, and the RGB slope are measured from the fiducial normal points defined in the near- infrared color-magnitude diagrams for each cluster

By scaling from the coma of the primary nucleus of 17P/Holmes, assumed to be 1.7 km in radius, we infer that the sixteen fragments have maximum effective radii between ~ 10 m and ~ 100 m on UT 2007 Nov. 6.  The fragments subsequently fade at a common rate of ~ 0.2 mag/day, consistent with steady depletion of ices from these bodies in the heat of the Sun

Stellar Populations in the Barred Spiral Galaxy NGC 4900 (Simon Cantin - 22 March, 2010)

About 800 spectra in the wavelength range 4700-5500 AA and 6270- 7000 AA have been collected with a spatial resolution of ~50 pc. In NGC 4900 we find many young bursts of star formation distributed along the galaxy large scale bar on each side of the nucleus. They represent nearly 40 per cent of the actual stellar mass in the field of view. The age for these bursts ranges from 5.5 to 8 Myr with a metallicity near and above 2 Zsun . The Mg 2 and Fe I absorption lines indicate the superposition of a background stellar population with an age between 100 Myr to 3 Gyr and a sub-solar metallicity on average

Discovery of a strong magnetic field in the rapidly rotating B2Vn star HR 7355 (M. E. Oksala - 18 March, 2010)

HR 7355 is both the most rapidly rotating known main-sequence magnetic star and the most rapidly rotating helium-strong star, with $v \sin i$ = 300 $\pm$ 15 km s$^{-1}$ and a rotational period of 0.5214404 $\pm$ 0.0000006 days.  The photometric light curve constructed from HIPPARCOS archival data and new CTIO measurements shows two minima separated by 0.5 in rotational phase and occurring 0.25 cycles before/after the magnetic extrema.  This photometric behavior coupled with previously-reported variable emission of the H$Î±$ line (which we confirm) strongly supports the proposal that HR 7355 harbors a structured magnetosphere similar to that in the prototypical helium-strong star, $Ï$ Ori E.

The CFHTLS Deep Catalog of Interacting Galaxies I. Merger Rate Evolution to z=1.2 (Carrie R. Bridge - 15 January, 2010)
We present the rest-frame optical galaxy merger fraction between 0.2<z<1.2, as a function of stellar mass and optical luminosity, as observed by the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Deep Survey (CFHTLS-Deep). Through the visual classification of all galaxies, down to i_vega<22.2 (~27,000 galaxies) over 2 square degrees, we have compiled the CFHTLS Deep Catalog of Interacting Galaxies, with ~1600 merging galaxies. We find the merger fraction to be 4.3% +/-0.3% at z~0.3 and 19.0% +/-2.5% at z~1, implying evolution of the merger fraction going as (1+z)^m, with m=2.25 +/-0.24. This result is inconsistent with a mild or non-evolving (m<1.5) scenario at a >4sigma level of confidence. We conclude that (1) the optical galaxy merger fraction does evolve with redshift, (2) the merger fraction depends mildly on stellar mass, with lower mass galaxies having higher merger fractions at z<1, and (3) star formation is triggered at all phases of a merger, with larger enhancements at later stages, consistent with N-body simulations.

The Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey: nine new quasars and the luminosity function at redshift 6 (Chris J. Willott - 1 December, 2009)
We present discovery imaging and spectroscopy for nine new z ~ 6 quasars found in the Canada-France High-z Quasar Survey (CFHQS) bringing the total number of CFHQS quasars to 19. By combining the CFHQS with the more luminous SDSS sample we are able to derive the quasar luminosity function from a sample of 40 quasars at redshifts 5.74 < z < 6.42. The binned data also suggest a break in the luminosity function at M_1450 approx -25. The luminosity function is strongly constrained (1 sigma uncertainty < 0.1 dex) over the range -27.5 < M_1450 < -24.7. The best-fit parameters are Phi(M_1450^*) = 1.14 x 10^-8 Mpc^-3 mag^-1, break magnitude M_1450^* = -25.13 and bright end slope beta = -2.81. For a break magnitude in the range -26 < M_1450^* < -24 we find -3.8 < beta < -2.3 at 95% confidence. We calculate the z = 6 quasar intergalactic ionizing flux and show it is between 20 and 100 times lower than that necessary for reionization

Localization of the X-ray Source in the Globular Cluster G1 with Chandra (A. K. H. Kong - 27 June, 2010)
We report the most accurate X-ray position of the X-ray source in the giant globular cluster G1 in M31 by using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). G1 is clearly detected with Chandra and by cross-registering with HST and CFHT images, we derive a 1-sigma error radius of 0.15 arcsec, significantly smaller than the previous measurement by XMM-Newton. Alternatively, the probability that a 1.5 solar masses cluster LMXB lies within the 95 per cent X-ray error circle is about 0.7

Outflows and Massive Stars in the protocluster IRAS 05358+3543 (Adam G. Ginsburg - 24 September, 2013)
The Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope H2 images and James Clerk Maxwell Telescope CO data cubes of the IRAS 05358 region reveal several new outflows, most of which emerge from the dense cluster of sub-mm cores associated with the Sh 2-233IR NE cluster to the northeast of IRAS 05358. We have identified probable sources for 6 outflows and candidate counterflows for 7 out of a total of 11 seen to be originating from the IRAS 05358 clusters

Discovery of a magnetic field in the O9 sub-giant star HD 57682 by the MiMeS Collaboration (J. H. Grunhut - 1 October, 2009)
We report the detection of a strong, organised magnetic field in the O9IV star HD 57682, using spectropolarimetric observations obtained with ESPaDOnS at the 3.6-m Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope within the context of the Magnetism in Massive Stars (MiMeS) Large Program. From the fitting of our spectra using NLTE model atmospheres we determined that HD 57682 is a $17^{+19}_{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$ star with a radius of $7.0^{+2.4}_{-1.8}$ R$_\odot$, and a relatively low mass-loss rate of $1.4^{+3.1}_{-0.95}\times10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The photospheric absorption lines are narrow, and we use the Fourier transform technique to infer $v\sin i=15\pm3$ km s$^{-1}$. This $v\sin i$ implies a maximum rotational period of 31.5 d, a value qualitatively consistent with the observed variability of the optical absorption and emission lines, as well as the Stokes $V$ profiles and longitudinal field. Using a Bayesian analysis of the velocity-resolved Stokes $V$ profiles to infer the magnetic field characteristics, we tentatively derive a dipole field strength of $1680^{+134}_{-356}$ G

Optical identification of XMM sources in the CFHTLS (C. S. Stalin - 2 September, 2009)
We present optical spectroscopic identifications of X-ray sources in ~3 square degrees of the XMM-Large Scale Structure survey (XMM-LSS), also covered by the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS), obtained with the AAOmega instrument at the Anglo Australian Telescope. In a flux limited sample of 829 point like sources in the optical band with g' <~22 mag and the 0.5-2 keV flux > 1x10^{-15}erg/cm^2/s, we observed 695 objects and obtained reliable spectroscopic identification for 489 sources, ~59% of the overall sample. Galactic stellar sources represent about 15% of the total (74/489). About 55% (267/489) are broad-line Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) spanning redshifts between 0.15 and 3.87 with a median value of 1.68. The optical-to-X-ray spectral index of the broad-line AGNs is 1.47, typical of optically-selected Type I quasars and is found to correlate with the rest frame X-ray and optical monochromatic luminosities at 2 keV and 2500 angstroms respectively. In addition, 32 and 116 X-ray sources are, respectively absorption and emission-line galaxies at z<0.76. From a line ratio diagnostic diagram it is found that in about 50% of these emission line galaxies, the emission lines are powered significantly by the AGN. In addition, 24 sources have ambiguous identification: in 8 cases, two XMM sources have a single optical source within 6 arcsecs of each of them, whereas, 2 and 14 XMM sources have, respectively, 3 and 2 possible optical sources within 6 arcsecs of each of them.
