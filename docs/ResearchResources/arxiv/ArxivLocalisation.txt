Lidar Measurement Bias Estimation via Return Waveform Modelling in a Context of 3D Mapping (Johann Laconte - 3 October, 2018)
We show that this assumption leads to predictable localisation drifts, especially when a bias related to measuring obstacles with high incidence angles is not taken into consideration. Using an experimental setup, we measured the bias of the Sick LMS151, Velodyne HDL-32E, and Robosense RS-LiDAR-16 as a function of depth and incidence angle, and showed that the bias can go up to 20 cm for high incidence angles

Doric: Foundations for Statistical Fault Localisation (David Landsberg - 1 October, 2018)
We demonstrate its effectiveness in, what is to our knowledge, the largest scale experiment in the fault localisation literature. For Defects4J benchmarks, cl permits a developer to find a fault after inspecting 6 lines of code 41.18% of the time. Furthermore, cl is more accurate at locating faults than all known 127 sbh. In particular, on Steimann's benchmarks one would expect to find a fault by investigating 5.02 methods, as opposed to 9.02 with the best performing sbh.

Bayesian Inference Analysis of Unmodelled Gravitational-Wave Transients (Francesco Pannarale - 10 September, 2018)
Using binary black hole signals, we compare BayesWave's performance to the theoretical best achievable performance in three key areas: sky localisation accuracy, signal/noise discrimination, and waveform reconstruction accuracy. For binaries, where the signal time-frequency volume decreases with mass, we find that BayesWave's performance reaches or approaches theoretical optimal limits for system masses above approximately 50 M_sun. Finally, the match between BayesWave- reconstructed signals and injected signals is broadly consistent with first-principles estimates of the maximum possible accuracy, peaking at about 0.95 for high mass systems and decreasing for lower-mass systems

From the detected position, we present 3$Ï$ error ellipses of 15 arcsec x 8.4 deg on the sky for the point of origin for the FRBs. We estimate an all-sky FRB rate at 843 MHz above a fluence $\cal F_\mathrm{lim}$ of 11 Jy ms of $\sim 78$ events sky$^{-1}$ d$^{-1}$ at the 95 percent confidence level. The measured rate of FRBs at 843 MHz is of order two times higher than we had expected, scaling from the FRB rate at the Parkes radio telescope, assuming that FRBs have a flat spectral index and a uniform distribution in Euclidean space

Localisation of gamma-ray interaction points in thick monolithic CeBr3 and LaBr3:Ce scintillators (Alexei Ulyanov - 19 January, 2017)
Localisation of gamma-ray interaction points in monolithic scintillator crystals can simplify the design and improve the performance of a future Compton telescope for gamma-ray astronomy. The measurements were conducted using 81 keV and 356 keV gamma-rays from a collimated 133Ba source. Although the position resolution was significantly better for the thinner crystal, the 20 mm thick CeBr3 crystal showed an acceptable resolution of about 5.4 mm FWHM for the x and y coordinates, and 7.8 mm FWHM for the z-coordinate (crystal depth) at 356 keV. The energy resolution (FWHM) measured for 662 keV gamma-rays was 4.0% for LaBr3:Ce and 5.5% for CeBr3.

SonoNet: Real-Time Detection and Localisation of Fetal Standard Scan Planes in Freehand Ultrasound (Christian F. Baumgartner - 25 July, 2017)
In this paper, we propose a novel method based on convolutional neural networks which can automatically detect 13 fetal standard views in freehand 2D ultrasound data as well as provide a localisation of the fetal structures via a bounding box. We found that the proposed method achieved an average F1-score of 0.798 in a realistic classification experiment modelling real-time detection, and obtained a 90.09% accuracy for retrospective frame retrieval. Moreover, an accuracy of 77.8% was achieved on the localisation task.

Automated Detection of Individual Micro-calcifications from Mammograms using a Multi-stage Cascade Approach (Zhi Lu - 7 October, 2016)
In mammography, the efficacy of computer-aided detection methods depends, in part, on the robust localisation of micro-calcifications ($Î¼$C). Currently, the most effective methods are based on three steps: 1) detection of individual $Î¼$C candidates, 2) clustering of individual $Î¼$C candidates, and 3) classification of $Î¼$C clusters. Specifically, on the INbreast dataset, we show that our approach has a true positive rate (TPR) for individual $Î¼$Cs of 40\% at one false positive per image (FPI) and a TPR of 80\% at 10 FPI. These results are significantly more accurate than the current state of the art, which has a TPR of less than 1\% at one FPI and a TPR of 10\% at 10 FPI

Signatures of many-body localisation in the dynamics of two-sites entanglement (Fernando Iemini - 9 January, 2017)

Using the protocol implemented in [Science {\bf 349}, 842 (2015)] we show that -- in the MBL phase -- the average two-site entanglement decays in time as a power law, while in the Anderson localised phase it tends to a plateau

AstroSat CZT Imager observations of GRB 151006A: timing, spectroscopy, and polarisation study (A. R. Rao - 26 August, 2016)

Deep Learning for Detecting Multiple Space-Time Action Tubes in Videos (Suman Saha - 4 August, 2016)
In this work, we propose an approach to the spatiotemporal localisation (detection) and classification of multiple concurrent actions within temporally untrimmed videos. In stage 1, appearance and motion detection networks are employed to localise and score actions from colour images and optical flow. In stage 2, the appearance network detections are boosted by combining them with the motion detection scores, in proportion to their respective spatial overlap. In stage 3, sequences of detection boxes most likely to be associated with a single action instance, called action tubes, are constructed by solving two energy maximisation problems via dynamic programming. We achieve a huge leap forward in action detection performance and report a 20% and 11% gain in mAP (mean average precision) on UCF-101 and J-HMDB-21 datasets respectively when compared to the state-of-the-art.

Genuine localisation transition in a long-range hopping model (Xiangyu Cao - 18 May, 2017)
A genuine localisation transition, with well defined mobility edges, appears as the hopping rate decreases slower than $\ell^{-2}$, where $\ell$ is the distance. Correspondingly, the decay of the localised states evolves from a standard exponential shape to a stretched exponential and finally to a novel $\exp(-C\ln^Îº\ell)$ behaviour, with $Îº> 1$.

We use the verification signal both to improve re-training and to reduce the search space for re-localisation, which makes these steps different to what is normally done in a weakly supervised setting. Extensive experiments on PASCAL VOC 2007 show that (1) using human verification to update detectors and reduce the search space leads to the rapid production of high-quality bounding-box annotations; (2) our scheme delivers detectors performing almost as good as those trained in a fully supervised setting, without ever drawing any bounding-box; (3) as the verification task is very quick, our scheme substantially reduces total annotation time by a factor 6x-9x.

This seriously challenges the capability of four-link (2 arm) configurations to successfully constrain the cosmological parameters. Conversely, six-link (3 arm) configurations have the potential to provide a test of the expansion of the universe up to $z\sim 8$ which is complementary to other cosmological probes based on electromagnetic observations only. In particular, in the most favourable scenarios, they can provide a significant constraint on $H_0$ at the level of 0.5%

Finite Volume Cumulant Expansion in QCD-Colorless Plasma (M. Ladrem - 3 September, 2015)
Due to the finite size effects, the localisation of the phase transition in finite systems and the determination of its order, become an extremely difficult task, even in the simplest known cases. In order to identify and locate the finite volume transition point $T_{0}(V)$ of the QCD deconfinement phase transition to a Colorless QGP, we have developed a new approach using the finite size cumulant expansion of the order parameter and the $L_{mn}$-method. The first six cumulants $C_{1,2,3,4,5,6}$ with the corresponding under-normalized ratios(skewness $Î£$, kurtosis $Îº$ ,pentosis $Î _{\pm}$ and hexosis $\mathcal{H}_{1,2,3}$) and three unnormalized combinations of them ($\mathcal{O}={\mathcal{Ï}^{2} \mathcal{Îº} }{\mathbf{Î£}^{-1} }$, $\mathcal{U} ={\mathcal{Ï}^{-2} \mathbf{Î£}^{-1} }$, $\mathcal{N} = \mathcal{Ï}^{2} \mathcal{Îº}$) are calculated and studied as functions of $(T,V)$. The extracted transition temperature value $T_{0}(V)$ agrees with that expected $T_{0}^{N}(V)$ from the order parameter and the thermal susceptibility $Ï_{T}\left( T,V\right)$, according to the standard procedure of localization to within about $2\%$

The detection efficiency of on-axis short gamma ray burst optical afterglows triggered by aLIGO/Virgo (David Coward - 14 September, 2014)
We show how the efficiency depends on the luminosity distribution of the optical afterglows, the telescope features, and the sky localisation of gravitational wave triggers. We estimate a plausible optical afterglow and gravitational wave coincidence rate of 1 yr$^{-1}$ (0.1 yr$^{-1}$) for NS-NS (NS-BH), and how this rate is scaled down in detection efficiency by the time it takes to image the gravitational wave sky localization and the limiting magnitude of the telescopes. For NS-NS (NS-BH) we find maximum detection efficiencies of $>80%$ when the total imaging time is less than 200 min (80 min) and the limiting magnitude fainter than 20 (21). We show that relatively small telescopes $(m<18)$ can achieve similar detection efficiencies to meter class facilities $(m<20)$ with similar fields of view, only if the less sensitive instruments can respond to the trigger and image the field within 10-15 min

Since the advent of the Swift satellite it has been possible to obtain precise localisations of GRB positions of sub-arcsec accuracy within seconds, facilitating ground-based robotic telescopes to automatically slew to the target within seconds. This has yielded a plethora of observational data for the afterglow phase of the GRB, but the quantity of data (<2 keV) covering the initial prompt emission still remains small. 080319B/naked-eye burst), long-prompt emission (e.g., 080928, 110205A) or triggered on a pre-cursor (e.g., 041219A, 050820A, 061121). As a result of the time delay of the second emission, it enabled optical imaging (from 3 to 7 bands) to be taken with the GROND instrument to a resolution as fine as 10s

Australia Telescope Compact Array observations of Fermi unassociated sources (Leonid Petrov - 1 May, 2013)
We have detected 424 sources with flux densities in a range of 2 mJy to 6 Jy that lie within the 99 per cent localisation uncertainty of 283 gamma-ray sources. Of these, 146 objects were detected in both the 5 and 9 GHz bands. We found 84 sources in our sample with a spectral index flatter than -0.5. The majority of detected sources are weaker than 100 mJy and for this reason were not found in previous surveys. Approximately 1/3 of our sample, 128 objects, have the probability of being associated by more than 10 times than the probability of being a background source found in the vicinity of a gamma-ray object by chance

The magneto transport behavior of the film also differs from the bulk single crystals and the magnetoresistance of the sample is nearly 20 to 75% with the application of the applied field(0 to 10 T) and it falls up to 5 to 40% below a certain temperature and the TC of the film increases to higher temperature with the increasing field. The film also shows anisotropic magnetoresistance as large as 20% depending on applied magnetic field direction.

Toward an optimal search strategy of optical and gravitational wave emissions from binary neutron star coalescence (D. M. Coward - 29 April, 2011)
Observations of an optical source coincident with gravitational wave emission detected from a binary neutron star coalescence will improve the confidence of detection, provide host galaxy localisation, and test models for the progenitors of short gamma ray bursts. We employ optical observations of three short gamma ray bursts, 050724, 050709, 051221, to estimate the detection rate of a coordinated optical and gravitational wave search of neutron star mergers. We find a median coincident detection rate of 4 yr^{-1} for the three bursts. GRB 050724 like bursts, with wide opening jet angles, offer the most optimistic rate of 13 coincident detections yr^{-1}, and would be detectable by Zadko up to five days after the trigger. Late time imaging to m=26 could detect off-axis afterglows for GRB 051221 like bursts several months after the trigger

Upper Limits on X-ray Emission from Two Rotating Radio Transients (D. L. Kaplan - 27 August, 2009)

Despite deep searches (especially for J1847-0257) we did not detect any emission with 0.3-8 keV count-rate limits of 1 counts/ks and 0.068 counts/ks, respectively, at 3sigma confidence. Assuming thermal emission similar to that seen from J1819-1458 (a blackbody with radius of approximately 20 km), we derive effective temperature limits of 77 eV and 91 eV for the nominal values of the distances and column densities to both sources, although both of those quantities are highly uncertain and correlated

Infrared identification of IGR J09026-4812 as a Seyfert 1 galaxy (J. A. Zurita Heras - 20 May, 2009)
Thereafter, an observation with Chandra pinpointed a single X-ray source within the ISGRI error circle, showing a hard spectrum, and improving its high-energy localisation to a subarcsecond accuracy. We performed optical and near infrared observations on the counterpart 2MASS J09023731-4813339 with the ESO/NTT telescope on March 2007. The source spectrum shows three main emission lines identified as the HeI lambda 1.0830 micron line, and the HI Pa_beta and Pa_alpha lines, typical in galaxies with an active galactic nucleus. The broadness of these lines reached values as large as 4000 km/s pointing towards a type 1 Seyfert galaxy. Thus, the near infrared photometry and spectroscopy allowed us to classify IGR J09026-4812 as a Seyfert galaxy of type 1.

Monte-Carlo simulations of the background of the coded-mask camera for X- and Gamma-rays on-board the Chinese-French GRB mission SVOM (O. Godet - 6 February, 2009)
We present here a detailed study of the instrument background and sensitivity of the coded-mask camera for X- and Gamma-rays (CXG) to be used in the detection and localisation of high-redshift GRBs on-board the international GRB mission SVOM. To compute the background spectrum, a Monte-Carlo approach was used to simulate the primary and secondary interactions between particles from the main components of the space environment that SVOM will encounter along its Low Earth Orbit (LEO) (with an altitude of 600 km and an inclination of ~ 30 deg) and the body of the CXG. According to our results, i) the design of the passive shield of the camera ensures that in the 4-50 keV imaging band the cosmic X-Gamma-ray background is dominant whilst the internal background should start to become dominant above 70-90 keV; ii) the current camera design ensures that the CXG camera will be more sensitive to high-redshift GRBs than the Swift Burst Alert Telescope thanks to a low-energy threshold of 4 keV.

SU(5) grand unification on a domain-wall brane from an E_6-invariant action (Aharon Davidson - 26 March, 2008)
This is achieved through the confluence of the clash-of-symmetries mechanism for symmetry breaking through domain-wall formation, and the Dvali-Shifman gauge-boson localisation idea. It requires an E_6 gauge-invariant action, yielding a domain-wall solution that has E_6 broken to differently embedded SO(10) x U(1) subgroups in the two bulk regions on opposite sides of the wall. On the wall itself, the unbroken symmetry is the intersection of the two bulk subgroups, and contains SU(5). A 4+1-dimensional fermion family in the 27 of E_6 gives rise to localised left-handed zero-modes in the 5^* + 10 + 1 + 1 representation of SU(5). The remaining ten fermion components of the 27 are delocalised exotic states, not appearing in the effective 3+1-dimensional theory on the domain-wall brane

Orbital ordering in cubic LaMnO3 from first principles calculations (H. Zenia - 20 February, 2006)
We found a strong tendency to localisation of the Mn $e_{g}$ electron and to orbital ordering. We found the ground state to be orbitally ordered with a staggered order of $x^{2}-z^{2}$ and $y^{2}-z^{2}$ orbits in one plane and this order is repeated along the third direction. The difference in energy with a solution consisting of the ordering of $3x^{2}-r^{2}$ and $3y^{2}-r^{2}$ is, however, very small. The strong tendency to localisation of the $e_{g}$ electron in LaMnO$_{3}$ accounts for the survival of local distortions above the structural phase transition temperature.

Properties of Ly-alpha and Gamma Ray Burst selected starbursts at high redshifts (J. P. U. Fynbo - 14 December, 2004)
Selection of starbursts through either deep narrow band imaging of redshifted Ly-alpha emitters, or localisation of host galaxies of gamma-ray bursts both give access to starburst galaxies that are significantly fainter than what is currently available from selection techniques based on the continuum (such as Lyman-break selection). Furthermore, we briefly describe the properties of host galaxies of gamma-ray bursts at z>2

The potential of INTEGRAL for the detection of high redshift GRBs (J. Gorosabel - 12 July, 2004)

Whereas SWIFT and HETE 2 would detect a higher number of GRBs than INTEGRAL, IBIS might be able to detect high redshift (z>~7) GRBs, unreachable for SWIFT and HETE 2

Scaling the localisation lengths for two interacting particles in one-dimensional random potentials (Rudolf A. Roemer - 28 September, 1998)
Using a numerical decimation method, we compute the localisation length $Î»_{2}$ for two onsite interacting particles (TIP) in a one-dimensional random potential. We show that an interaction $U>0$ does lead to $Î»_2(U) > Î»_2(0)$ for not too large $U$ and test the validity of various proposed fit functions for $Î»_2(U)$. Finite-size scaling allows us to obtain infinite sample size estimates $Î¾_{2}(U)$ and we find that $ Î¾_{2}(U) \sim Î¾_2(0)^{Î±(U)} $ with $Î±(U)$ varying between $Î±(0)\approx 1$ and $Î±(1) \approx 1.5$

Infinite sample size estimates $Î¾_{2}(U)$ are obtained by finite-size scaling. For U=0 we reproduce approximately the well-known dependence of the one-particle localisation length on disorder while for finite $U$, we find that $ Î¾_{2}(U) \sim Î¾_2(0)^{Î²(U)} $ with $Î²(U)$ varying between $Î²(0)=1$ and $Î²(1) \approx 1.5$

Space and time as a consequence of GRW quantum jumps (Tejinder P. Singh - 30 August, 2018)
In the present paper we suggest that these jumps take place in Hilbert space, with no reference to physical space, and physical three-dimensional space arises as a consequence of localisation of macroscopic objects in the universe. We then suggest that similar jumps take place for a hypothetical time operator in Hilbert space, and classical time as we know it emerges from localisation of this time operator for macroscopic objects

Algorithmic clothing: hybrid recommendation, from street-style-to-shop (Y Qian - 12 November, 2017)
In this paper we detail Cortexica's (https://www.cortexica.com) recommendation framework -- particularly, we describe how a hybrid visual recommender system can be created by combining conditional random fields for segmentation and deep neural networks for object localisation and feature representation. The recommendation system that is built after localisation, segmentation and classification has two properties -- first, it is knowledge based in the sense that it learns pairwise preference/occurrence matrix by utilising knowledge from experts (images from fashion blogs) and second, it is content-based as it utilises a deep learning based framework for learning feature representation

The observations were explained by another localisation mechanism, the chain segmentation by outliers in heavy tails of the disorder distribution

A bound on the averaged spectral shift function and a lower bound on the density of states for random SchrÃ¶dinger operators on $\mathbb{R}^d$ (Adrian Dietlein - 5 June, 2016)
We obtain a bound on the expectation of the spectral shift function for alloy-type random SchrÃ¶dinger operators on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in the region of localisation, corresponding to a change from Dirichlet to Neumann boundary conditions along the boundary of a finite volume. As an application of our bound on the spectral shift function, we prove a reverse Wegner inequality for finite-volume SchrÃ¶dinger operators in the region of localisation with a constant locally uniform in the energy

Using the 2-MASS Photometric Redshift Survey to optimize LIGO Follow-Up Observations (Elisa Antolini - 14 July, 2016)

Under the assumption that the probability of a gravitational-wave event from a given region of space is proportional to the density of galaxies within the probed volume, one can calculate an improved localisation of the position of the source simply by multiplying the LIGO-Virgo skymap by the density of galaxies in the range of redshifts

Braneworld localisation in hyperbolic spacetime (B. Crampton - 21 May, 2015)
A fully back-reacted solution including the NS5-brane is constructed by recognising the 10D Salam-Sezgin vacuum solution as a "brane resolved through transgression." The background hyperbolic structure plays a key rÃ´le in generating a mass gap in the spectrum of the transverse-space wave operator, which gives rise to the localisation of gravity on the 6D NS5-brane worldvolume, or, equally, in a further compactification to 4D. Also key to the successful localisation of gravity is the specific form of the corresponding transverse wavefunction SchrÃ¶dinger problem, which asymptotically involves a $V=-1/(4Ï^2)$ potential, where $Ï$ is the transverse-space radius, and for which the NS5-brane source gives rise to a specific choice of self-adjoint extension for the transverse wave operator

Environment-assisted quantum transport in ordered systems (Ivan Kassal - 4 May, 2012)
In disordered systems, it has been understood as the suppression of coherent quantum localisation through noise, which brings detuned quantum levels into resonance and thus facilitates transport. We report several new mechanisms of environment-assisted transport in ordered systems, in which there is no localisation to overcome and where one would naively expect that coherent transport is the fastest possible

Twisted Covariance as a Non Invariant Restriction of the Fully Covariant DFR Model (Gherardo Piacitelli - 22 February, 2010)
We show that the tensor nature of theta is only hidden in the formalism: in particular if theta fulfils the DFR conditions, the twisted Lorentz covariant model of the flat quantum spacetime may be equivalently described in terms of the DFR model, if we agree to discard a huge non invariant set of localisation states; it is only this last step which, if taken as a basic assumption, severely breaks the relativity principle. We also will show that the above mentioned, relativity breaking, ad hoc rejection of localisation states is an independent, unnecessary assumption, as far as some popular approaches to quantum field theory on the quantum Minkowski spacetime are concerned

Topological structure of the SU(3) vacuum and exceptional eigenmodes of the improved Wilson-Dirac operator (D. Smith - 26 September, 1997)
We also investigate the low-lying eigenmodes of the (improved) Wilson-Dirac operator, in particular, the appearance of zero-modes and their space-time localisation with respect to instantons in the underlying gauge field.

Conformal Symmetry and Quantum Relativity (Marc-Thierry Jaekel - 16 June, 1997)
Localisation observables are defined as to obey Lorentz covariant commutations relations and in particular include a time observable conjugated to energy. These results plead for a new representation not only of space-time localisation but also of motion.

Lateral superlattices as voltage-controlled traps for excitons (S. Zimmermann - 7 May, 1997)
We demonstrate the localisation of quantum well excitons in a periodic array of linear traps using photoluminescence experiments. The localisation originates from the periodical modulation of the strength of the quantum-confined Stark effect in the plane of the quantum well

The quantum potential: the breakdown of classical symplectic symmetry and the energy of localisation and dispersion (M. R. Brown - 5 February, 2002)
In addition, it is shown that the quantum potential in configuration space may be expressed as the sum of a momentum dispersion energy and a spatial localisation energy; a complementary expression for the quantum potential being found in the momentum representation

Quantum dynamics with intermediate measurements in agreement with the classical dynamics (B. Kaulakys - 14 October, 1996)
The effect of repetitive measurement for quantum dynamics of driven by an intensive external force of the simple few-level systems as well as of the multilevel systems that exhibit the quantum localisation of classical chaos is investigated. Frequent measurement of the simple system yields to the quantum Zeno effect while that of the suppressed quantum system, which classical counterpart exhibits chaos, results in the delocalisation of the quantum suppression

Randomly Crosslinked Macromolecular Systems: Vulcanisation Transition to and Properties of the Amorphous Solid State (Paul M. Goldbart - 10 April, 1996)
This solid state is a most unusual one: localisation occurs about mean positions that are distributed homogeneously and randomly, and to an extent that varies randomly from monomer to monomer

A Unified Model for Two Localisation Problems: Electron States in Spin-Degenerate Landau Levels, and in a Random Magnetic Field (D. K. K. Lee - 19 November, 1993)
A single model is presented which represents both of the two apparently unrelated localisation problems of the title. It is argued that the localisation length in a spin-degenerate Landau level diverges at two distinct energies, with the same critical behaviour as in a spin-split Landau level, and that all states of a charged particle moving in two dimensions, in a random magnetic field with zero average, are localised.
