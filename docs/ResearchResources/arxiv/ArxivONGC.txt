Deghosting of Ocean Bottom Cable Data:Two approaches (Jagmeet Singh - 27 January, 2005)
One of them is phase shifting of geophone followed by least square matching of cross ghosted geophone and hydrophone data.In the second approach,phase shifting of geophone is followed by direct matching of geophone's amplitude spectrum with that of the hydrophone within the seismic bandwidth.Results obtained from both approaches were found to be at par with one of the proprietary softwares available with ONGC.
