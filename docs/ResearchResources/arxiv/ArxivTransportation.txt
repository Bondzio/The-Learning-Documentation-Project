Full Virtualization of Renault's Engine Management Software and Application to System Development (Dirk Von Wissel - 16 February, 2018)

In the Renault EMS architecture software is composed in to about 20 functions, such as Air System, Combustion etc. The Renault EMS development process includes basically the following steps [5]. 1. Specification of about 200 generic configurable modules per ECU using MATLAB/Simulink. 2. 3. To insure software quality, this step is repeatedly performed with steps 1 and 2, based on the simulation capabilities of MATLAB/Simulink. 4. 5. 6. In contrast to step 3, the interactions of all modules and interactions with the system environment are visible then and subject to testing. Critical assessment of the above process shows that there is a considerable delay between delivery of a set of specifications to the software project team (at the end of step 3) and system-level tests based on an ECU that runs entire software (step 6)

Route-cost-assignment with joint user and operator behavior as a many-to-one stable matching assignment game (Saeid Rasulkhani - 24 August, 2018)
We propose a generalized market equilibrium model using assignment game criteria for evaluating transportation systems that consist of both operators' and users' decisions: fixed route transit, multimodal systems, and Mobility-as-a-Service in general. Based on the taxi data and study area in Lower Manhattan, the model justifies a market share of 69.3% of users that would take shared rides. Allowing shared taxi results in a 20.5% decrease in travel mileage. The model suggests that a shared taxi dispatch algorithm adopting a policy that can require passengers to walk up to 1 block away to meet with a shared taxi would require $0.35/traveler of the operating cost savings to transfer back to the users if the operator does not wish to turn away any of these passengers.

Estimating savings in parking demand using shared vehicles for home-work commuting (DÃ¡niel Kondor - 18 June, 2018)
The increasing availability and adoption of shared vehicles as an alternative to personally-owned cars presents ample opportunities for achieving more efficient transportation in cities. With private cars spending on the average over 95\% of the time parked, one of the possible benefits of shared mobility is the reduced need for parking space. In the future-looking, self-driving vehicle scenario, our analysis suggests that up to 50\% reduction in parking needs can be achieved at the expense of increasing total traveled kilometers of less than 2\%.

We study the interaction between a fleet of electric, self-driving vehicles servicing on-demand transportation requests (referred to as Autonomous Mobility-on-Demand, or AMoD, system) and the electric power network. Lack of coordination between the AMoD system and the power network can cause a 4.4% increase in the price of electricity in Dallas-Fort Worth; conversely, coordination between the AMoD system and the power network could reduce electricity expenditure compared to the case where no cars are present (despite the increased demand for electricity) and yield savings of up $147M/year

Forward Collision Vehicular Radar with IEEE 802.11: Feasibility Demonstration through Measurements (Enoch R. Yeh - 5 June, 2017)
Increasing safety and automation in transportation systems has led to the proliferation of radar and IEEE 802.11 dedicated short range communication (DSRC) in vehicles. Consider the feasibility of using an IEEE 802.11 orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) communications waveform to perform radar functions. In addition, we propose an alternative to vehicular forward collision detection by extending IEEE 802.11 dedicated short-range communications (DSRC) and WiFi technology to radar, providing a foundation for joint communications and radar framework. Furthermore, we perform an experimental demonstration using existing IEEE 802.11 devices with minimal modification through algorithm processing on frequency-domain channel estimates. The results of this paper show that our solution delivers similar accuracy and reliability to mmWave radar devices with as little as 20 MHz of spectrum (doubling DSRC's 10 MHz allocation), indicating significant potential for industrial devices with joint vehicular communications and radar capabilities.

Widespread and extensive use of computers and their interconnections in almost all sectors like communications, finance, transportation, military, governance, education, energy etc., have made them attractive targets for adversaries to spy, disrupt or steal information by pressing of few keystrokes from any part of the world. This paper presents a survey of major cyberattacks from 2001 to 2013 and analyzes these attacks to understand the motivation, targets and technique(s) employed by the attackers

Cyber-physical Control of Road Freight Transport (B. Besselink - 13 July, 2015)
Freight transportation is of outmost importance for our society and is continuously increasing. At the same time, transporting goods on roads accounts for about 26% of all energy consumption and 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union. From the reduced air drag, platooning trucks traveling close together can save about 10% of their fuel consumption. A realistic case study with 200 heavy-duty vehicles performing transportation tasks in Sweden is described. Simulations show overall fuel savings at more than 5% thanks to coordinated platoon planning

Ride Sharing with a Vehicle of Unlimited Capacity (Angelo Fanelli - 9 June, 2016)
A ride sharing problem is considered where we are given a graph, whose edges are equipped with a travel cost, plus a set of objects, each associated with a transportation request given by a pair of origin and destination nodes. The algorithm is then used as a subroutine to efficiently solve instances defined over cycles, hence covering all graphs with maximum degree $2$. This traces the frontier of tractability, since $\bf NP$-hard instances are exhibited over trees whose maximum degree is $3$.
