Regolith behavior under asteroid-level gravity conditions: low-velocity impact experiments (Julie Brisset - 2 October, 2018)
Once at microgravity levels (<10-4g), the lowest impact energies also produced impactor rebound. In these microgravity conditions, ejecta started to be produced for impacts at > 10 cm/s. When projectile rebound occurred, we observed that its coefficients of restitution on the bed of regolith simulant decrease by a factor of 10 with increasing impact speeds from ~5 cm/s up to 100 cm/s

Machine Learning Based Uplink Transmission Power Prediction for LTE and Upcoming 5G Networks using Passive Downlink Indicators (Robert Falkenberg - 18 June, 2018)
For 4G/5G-based cellular communication systems, the effective transmission power of uplink data transmissions is of crucial importance for the overall system power consumption. In a comparison of three different machine learning methods, Random-Forest models thoroughly performed best with a mean average error of 3.166 dB. As the absolute sum of errors converges towards zero and falls below 1 dB after 28 predictions in average, the approach is well-suited for long-term power estimations.

High performance magnetic material with Ce and La: an alternative to Nd-Fe-B magnet (Rajiv K. Chouhan - 5 June, 2018)
Detailed analysis of the magnetic moment and magnetic anisotropy change has been studied by individually inserting the La and Ce atoms at the two inequivalent sites (4g and 4f sites) of the 2-14-B tetragonal structure. Accurate prediction of the total magnetic moment with the orbital contribution in the 2-14-B structure shows the maximum moment for Ce2Fe14B (3.86 Î¼B/f.u less) compared to Nd2Fe14B. Theoretical analysis confirms that regardless of the anti-parallel spin moment emerging in the Ce atom the complex structure of the Ce substituted compound at 4f-site gives the maximum anisotropy of 2.27 meV/cell with lowering the magnetic moment by 1.26 Î¼B/f.u

Ubiquitous Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communications (Giovanni Interdonato - 10 April, 2018)
From 1G to 4G, the massive traffic growth has been managed by a combination of wider bandwidths, refined radio interfaces, and smaller cells [1]. Due its cost-efficiency, the latter has contributed the most; cell towers used to be 10 km apart and are now only 100 m apart in urban areas. While rigid frequency planning was originally used to alleviate inter-cell interference, the interference is becoming a major bottleneck as we densify the networks [2], because each cell is then hit by non-negligible interference from many neighboring cells. One way to deal with inter-cell interference is to manage it spatially by Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) methods [3], which is a key 5G technology

Entanglement entropy and algebraic holography (Bernard S. Kay - 25 May, 2016)

We point out here that the RT-equality implies that, in the quantum theory on the bulk AdS background which is related to the boundary CFT according to Rehren's 1999 algebraic holography theorem, the entanglement entropy between two complementary bulk Rehren wedges is equal to 1/4G times the (suitably cut off) area of their shared ridge

Zeros of quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions in the hyperelliptic ensemble (Hung M. Bui - 23 May, 2016)
In the case of the $1$-level density, when the Fourier transform of the test function is supported in the restricted interval $(\frac{1}{3},1)$, we compute a secondary term of size $q^{-\frac{4g}{3}}/g$, which is not predicted by the Ratios Conjecture. For example, if the Fourier transform is supported in $(\frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{2})$, we identify another lower order term of size $q^{-\frac{8g}{5}}/g$. We also compute the pair correlation, and as for the $1$-level density, we detect lower order terms under certain restrictions; for example, we see a term of size $q^{-g}/g^2$ when the Fourier transform is supported in $(\frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2})$. The $1$-level density and the pair correlation allow us to obtain non-vanishing results for $L(\frac12,Ï_D)$, as well as lower bounds for the proportion of simple zeros of this family of $L$-functions.

Legacy 2G--4G systems covering large areas were envisioned to serve both indoor and outdoor environments. However, in the 5G-era, 80\% of overall traffic is expected to be generated in indoors. We envision 60\,GHz mmWave picocell architecture to support high-speed indoor and hotspot communications. We envisage the 5G indoor network as a combination of-, and interplay between, 2.4/5\,GHz having robust coverage and 60\,GHz links offering high datarate. We propose 60\,GHz picocellular network architecture, called CogCell, leveraging the ubiquitous WiFi. We propose to use 60\,GHz for the data plane and 2.4/5GHz for the control plane. The hybrid network architecture considers an opportunistic fall-back to 2.4/5\,GHz in case of poor connectivity in the 60\,GHz domain. Further, to avoid the frequent re-beamforming in 60\,GHz directional links due to mobility, we propose a cognitive module -- a sensor-assisted intelligent beam switching procedure -- which reduces the communication overhead

A uniqueness of periodic maps on surfaces (Susumu Hirose - 10 February, 2015)
Kulkarni showed that, if g is greater than 3, a periodic map on an oriented surface S_g of genus g with order more than or equal to 4g is uniquely determined by its order, up to conjugation and power. In this paper, we show that, if g is greater than 30, the same phenomenon happens for periodic maps on the surfaces with orders more than 8g/3 and, for any integer N, there is g > N such that there are periodic maps of S_g of order 8g/3 which are not conjugate up to power each other

On the Oort conjecture for Shimura varieties of unitary and orthogonal types (Ke Chen - 27 July, 2015)
Using the poly-stability of Higgs bundles on curves and the slope inequality of Xiao on fibred surfaces, we show that a Shimura curve $C$ is not contained generically in the Torelli locus if its canonical Higgs bundles contains a unitary Higgs subbundle of rank at least $(4g+2)/5$. A similar result holds for Shimura subvarieties of $\mathbf{SO}(n,2)$-type, defined by spin groups associated to quadratic spaces over a totally real number field of degree at least 6 subject to some natural constraints of signatures.

Isospectral Hermitian counterpart of complex non Hermitian Hamiltonian $p^{2}-gx^{4}+a/x^{2}$ (Asiri Nanayakkara - 17 July, 2014)
In this paper we show that the non-Hermitian Hamiltonians $H=p^{2}-gx^{4}+a/x^2$ and the conventional Hermitian Hamiltonians $h=p^2+4gx^{4}+bx$ ($a,b\in \mathbb{R}$) are isospectral if $a=(b^2-4g\hbar^2)/16g$ and $a\geq -\hbar^2/4$. This new class includes the equivalent non-Hermitian - Hermitian Hamiltonian pair, $p^{2}-gx^{4}$ and $p^{2}+4gx^{4}-2\hbar \sqrt{g}x,$ found by Jones and Mateo six years ago as a special case. When $a=\left(b^{2}-4g\hbar ^{2}\right) /16g$ and $a<-\hbar^2/4,$ although $h$ and $H$ are still isospectral, $b$ is complex and $h$ is no longer the Hermitian counterpart of $H$.

The implemented turbo decoder consists of 16 Radix-4 MAP decoder cores, and the chip core area is 2.43 mm^2. When clocked at 600 MHz, this turbo decoder can achieve a maximum decoding throughput of 826 Mbps in the HSPA+ mode and 1.67 Gbps in the LTE/LTE-Advanced mode, exceeding the peak data rate requirements for both standards.

On the twisted Alexander polynomial for representations into SL_2(C) (Anh T. Tran - 3 September, 2013)
It is known for every knot $K$ that if $K$ is fibered, then for every non-abelian representation, $Î_{K,Ï}$ is monic and has degree $4g(K)-2$ where $g(K)$ is the genus of $K$. In fact they proved a stronger result: if a 2-bridge knot $K$ is non-fibered, then all but finitely many non-abelian representations on some component have $Î_{K,Ï}$ non-monic and degree $4g(K)-2$. For these families, we calculate the number of non-abelian representations where $Î_{K,Ï}$ is monic and calculate the number of non-abelian representations where the degree of $Î_{K,Ï}$ is less than $4g(K)-2$.

Achieving Optimal Throughput and Near-Optimal Asymptotic Delay Performance in Multi-Channel Wireless Networks with Low Complexity: A Practical Greedy Scheduling Policy (Bo Ji - 23 March, 2014)
In this paper, we focus on the scheduling problem in multi-channel wireless networks, e.g., the downlink of a single cell in fourth generation (4G) OFDM-based cellular networks. While a class of $O(n^{2.5} \log n)$-complexity hybrid scheduling policies are recently developed to guarantee both rate-function delay optimality (in the many-channel many-user asymptotic regime) and throughput optimality (in the general non-asymptotic setting), their practical complexity is typically high. Thus, we are able to achieve a reduction in complexity (from $O(n^{2.5} \log n)$ of the hybrid policies to $2n^2 + 2n$) with a minimal drop in the delay performance

Mid-Infrared Galaxy Morphology from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S^4G): The Imprint of the de Vaucouleurs Revised Hubble-Sandage Classification System at 3.6 microns (R. Buta - 4 August, 2010)
For this purpose, we have prepared classification images for 207 galaxies from the Spitzer archive, most of which are formally part of the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S^4G), a Spitzer post-cryogenic ("warm") mission Exploration Science Legacy Program survey of 2,331 galaxies closer than 40 Mpc. We find that 3.6 micron classifications are well-correlated with blue-light classifications, to the point where the essential features of many galaxies look very similar in the two very different wavelength regimes. (2002), the main difference between blue light and mid-IR types is an approximately 1 stage interval difference for S0/a to Sbc or Sc galaxies, which tend to appear "earlier" in type at 3.6 microns due to the slightly increased prominence of the bulge, the reduced effects of extinction, and the reduced (but not completely eliminated) effect of the extreme population I stellar component. We present an atlas of all of the 207 galaxies analyzed here, and bring attention to special features or galaxy types that are particularly distinctive in the mid-IR.

OGLE-2003-BLG-238: Microlensing Mass Estimate of an Isolated Star (Guangfei Jiang - 20 April, 2004)
In terms of microlensing observables, the mass is given by M=(c^2/4G)\tilde r_E Î¸_E and so requires the measurement of both the angular Einstein radius, Î¸_E, and the projected Einstein radius, \tilde r_E. Here we analyze OGLE-2003-BLG-238, a spectacularly bright (I_min=10.3), high-magnification (A_max = 170) microlensing event. Pronounced finite source effects permit a measurement of Î¸_E = 650 uas. Although the timescale of the event is only t_E = 38 days, one can still obtain weak constraints on the microlens parallax: 4.4 AU < \tilde r_E < 18 AU at the 1 Ïlevel. Together these two parameter measurements yield a range for the lens mass of 0.36 M_sun < M < 1.48 M_sun
