MLPdf: An Effective Machine Learning Based Approach for PDF Malware Detection (Jason Zhang - 21 August, 2018)
Due to the popularity of portable document format (PDF) and increasing number of vulnerabilities in major PDF viewer applications, malware writers continue to use it to deliver malware via web downloads, email attachments and other methods in both targeted and non-targeted attacks. A group of high quality features are extracted from two real-world datasets which comprise around 105000 benign and malicious PDF documents. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed MLPdf approach exhibits excellent performance which significantly outperforms all evaluated eight well known commercial anti-virus scanners with a much higher true positive rate of 95.12% achieved while maintaining a very low false positive rate of 0.08%.

Power Networks: A Novel Neural Architecture to Predict Power Relations (Michelle Lam - 17 July, 2018)
In this paper, we present a novel neural architecture that captures manifestations of power within individual emails which are then aggregated in an order-preserving way in order to infer the direction of power between pairs of participants in an email thread. We obtain an accuracy of 80.4%, a 10.1% improvement over state-of-the-art methods, in this task. We further apply our model to the task of predicting power relations between individuals based on the entire set of messages exchanged between them; here also, our model significantly outperforms the70.0% accuracy using prior state-of-the-art techniques, obtaining an accuracy of 83.0%.

MEADE: Towards a Malicious Email Attachment Detection Engine (Ethan M. Rudd - 22 April, 2018)
While machine learning has been successfully applied to portable executable (PE) malware detection, we ask, can we extend similar approaches to detect malware across heterogeneous file types commonly found in email attachments? In this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying machine learning as a static countermeasure to detect several types of malicious email attachments including Microsoft Office documents and Zip archives. To this end, we collected a dataset of over 5 million malicious/benign Microsoft Office documents from VirusTotal for evaluation as well as a dataset of benign Microsoft Office documents from the Common Crawl corpus, which we use to provide more realistic estimates of thresholds for false positive rates on in-the-wild data. Using deep neural networks and gradient boosted decision trees, we are able to obtain ROC curves with > 0.99 AUC on both Microsoft Office document and Zip archive datasets

Reinforcement Learning on Web Interfaces Using Workflow-Guided Exploration (Evan Zheran Liu - 24 February, 2018)
This has been a notable problem in training deep RL agents to perform web-based tasks, such as booking flights or replying to emails, where a single mistake can ruin the entire sequence of actions. From each demonstration, we induce high-level "workflows" which constrain the allowable actions at each time step to be similar to those in the demonstration (e.g., "Step 1: click on a textbox; Step 2: enter some text"). We achieve new state-of-the-art results, and show that workflow-guided exploration improves sample efficiency over behavioral cloning by more than 100x.

Private Webmail 2.0 (Pwm 2.0) improves upon the current state of the art by increasing the usability and practical security of secure email for ordinary users. In this paper we describe user interface traits that positively affect the usability and security of Pwm 2.0: (1) an artificial delay to encryption that enhances user confidence in Pwm 2.0 while simultaneously instructing users on who can read their encrypted messages; (2) a modified composition interface that helps protect users from mistakenly sending sensitive information in the clear; (3) an annotated secure email composition interface that instructs users on how to correctly use secure email; and (4) inline, context-sensitive tutorials, which improved view rates for tutorials from less than 10% in earlier systems to over 90% for Pwm 2.0. In a user study involving 51 participants we validate these interface modifications, and also show that the use of manual encryption has no effect on usability or security.

Further, about 77% of the participants said that they would want to use a system which could provide them access control features, to maintain their privacy while sharing emails. We conducted a controlled experiment with 30 participants to evaluate the usability of the system. Each participant was required to perform 5 tasks. We found that, with a reasonable number of multiple attempts, all 30 participants were able to perform all 5 tasks given to them. The system usability score was found out to be 75.42. Moreover, 56.6% of the participants said that they would like to use ChaMAILeon frequently.

Instant messaging an effective way of communication in workplace (Tirus Muya Maina - 31 October, 2013)
Instant messaging is the multitasking tools of choice most people chatting over IM do other things at the same time.The use of IM in workplace is less intrusive than the use of phone, more immediate than email and has added advantage due to the ability to detect presence.In order for institution to maximize increased business productivity using instant messaging its imperative that organizations define and publish ICT policies, guidelines and regulations.Overall IM boosts business performance by making operations faster, more agile, and more efficient with very little additional cost thus Organizations that deploy IM would reap significant Return on Investment.Institutions should adopt IM meetings which are be more efficient and less prone to straying off topic, because of the relative effort of typing versus talking.

A Suffix Tree Approach to Email Filtering (Rajesh M. Pampapathi - 6 December, 2005)
A method for the scoring of emails using the suffix tree is developed and a number of scoring and score normalisation functions are tested. Our results show that the character level representation of emails and classes facilitated by the suffix tree can significantly improve classification accuracy when compared with the currently popular methods, such as naive Bayes

Improving spam filtering by combining Naive Bayes with simple k-nearest neighbor searches (Daniel Etzold - 30 November, 2003)
Using naive Bayes for email classification has become very popular within the last few months. In this paper we want to present empirical results of email classification using a combination of naive Bayes and k-nearest neighbor searches

Untraceable Email Cluster Bombs: On Agent-Based Distributed Denial of Service (Markus Jakobsson - 23 May, 2003)
We uncover a vulnerability that allows for an attacker to perform an email-based attack on selected victims, using only standard scripts and agents. We illustrate the potential impact of our attack by describing how an attacker can disable an email account by flooding its inbox; block competition during on-line auctions; harm competitors with an on-line presence; disrupt phone service to a given victim; cheat in SMS-based games; disconnect mobile corporate leaders from their networks; and disrupt electronic elections
