60 Validated Planets from K2 Campaigns 5-8 (John H. Livingston - 9 October, 2018)
We present a uniform analysis of 155 candidates from the second year of NASA's $K2$ mission (Campaigns 5-8), yielding 60 statistically validated planets spanning a range of properties, with median values of $R_p$ = 2.5 $R_\oplus$, $P$ = 7.1 d, $T_\mathrm{eq}$ = 811 K, and $J$ = 11.3 mag. The sample includes 24 planets in 11 multi-planetary systems, as well as 18 false positives, and 77 remaining planet candidates. Of particular interest are 18 planets smaller than 2 $R_\oplus$, five orbiting stars brighter than $J$ = 10 mag, and a system of four small planets orbiting the solar-type star EPIC 212157262. This work brings the $K2$ yield to over 360 planets, and by extrapolation we expect that $K2$ will have discovered $\sim$600 planets before the expected depletion of its on-board fuel in late 2018.

PAHs and star formation in the HII regions of nearby galaxies M83 and M33 (A. Maragkoudakis - 26 September, 2018)
Our main results are as follows: (i) the M33 and M83 HII regions lie in between Seyfert/LINER galaxies and HII-type galaxies in the 7.7/11.3 - 6.2/11.3 plane, while the different sub-samples exhibiting different 7.7/6.2 ratios; (ii) Using the NASA Ames PAH IR Spectroscopic database, we demonstrate that the 6.2/7.7 ratio does not effectively track PAH size, but the 11.3/3.3 PAH ratio does; (iii) variations on the 17 $Î¼$m PAH band depends on object type; however, there is no dependence on metallicity for both extragalactic HII regions and galaxies; (iv) the PAH/VSG intensity ratio decreases with the hardness of the radiation field and galactocentric radius (Rg), yet the ionization alone cannot account for the variation seen in all of our sources; (v) the relative strength of PAH features does not change significantly with increasing radiation hardness, as measured through the [NeIII]/[NeII] ratio and the ionization index; (vi) We present PAH SFR calibrations based on the tight correlation between the 6.2, 7.7, and 11.3 $Î¼$m PAH luminosities with the 24 $Î¼$m luminosity and the combination of the 24 $Î¼$m and H$Î±$ luminosity; (vii) Based on the total luminosity from PAH and FIR emission, we argue that extragalactic HII regions are more suitable templates in modeling and interpreting the large scale properties of galaxies compared to Galactic HII regions.

Directed Energy Interception of Satellites (Harrison She - 26 September, 2018)
In addition, other beamed power mission scenarios, such as orbital debris removal and our NASA program using DE for powering high performance ion engine missions, pose similar concerns. It is critical to quantify the probability and rates of interception of the DE beam with the approximately 2000 active Earth orbiting spacecraft. We have found that the probability of any active satellite, including its orbital position uncertainty, intercepting our beam during any of our many mission scenarios is extremely low ($\approx10^{-4}$)

The control system maintained the TM-spacecraft separation with an RMS error of less than 2$\,$nm and a noise spectral density of less than $3\,\textrm{nm}/\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ in the same band. We also report a differential acceleration noise between the two test masses with a spectral density of roughly $3\,\textrm{fm}/\textrm{s}^2/\sqrt{\textrm{Hz}}$ in the $1\,\textrm{mHz}\leq f \leq 30\,\textrm{mHz}$ band, slightly less than twice as large as the best performance reported with the baseline LISA Pathfinder configuration and below the current requirements for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission.

Aerodynamic Loads Alteration by Gurney Flap on Supercritical Airfoils at Transonic Speeds (Amir. S. Rezaei - 18 September, 2018)
Effects of a gurney flap were numerically investigated on the supercritical NASA airfoil by solving the two-dimensional Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations for a range of transonic Mach numbers and angles of attack, using turbulence compressible KW SST model. The height of the gurney flap was selected to be 1.65 percent chord length. Below the drag divergence Mach number, the gurney flap has a remarkable influence on the aerodynamic coefficients especially at -1 and 0 degrees angle of attack resulting in 50 percent increase in L over D ratio

Neutral Helium Triplet Spectroscopy of Quiescent Coronal Rain with Sensitivity Estimates for Spectropolarimetric Magnetic Field Diagnostics (Thomas A. Schad - 6 September, 2018)
This work describes off-limb observations of coronal rain in NOAA Active Region 12468 obtained in the He I 10830 $Ã$ triplet using the Massively MultipleXed Imaging Spectrograph experiment at the Dunn Solar Telescope along with co-temporal observations from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory and the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph. We detect rain simultaneously in the IRIS 1400 $Ã$ and 2796 $Ã$ channels and in He I 10830 $Ã$. A statistical analysis of He I spectral profiles for rain identified via automated detection indicate He I line radiances are, on average, $10^{4}$ ergs cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ sr$^{-1}$; the average translational velocity is 70 km s$^{-1}$ and Doppler widths are distributed around 10 km s$^{-1}$. We predict joint observations of the He I 10830 $Ã$ and 5876 $Ã$ multiplets, using first-light instrumentation, will provide inverted magnetic field errors of $\pm3.5$ G ($2Ï$) for spatial scales of $0.5''$ ($\sim360$ km) assuming dynamically-limited integration times of 5.5 seconds.

Pulse Morphology of the Galactic Center Magnetar PSR J1745-2900 (Aaron B. Pearlman - 6 September, 2018)
We present results from observations of the Galactic Center (GC) magnetar, PSR J1745-2900, at 2.3 and 8.4 GHz with the NASA Deep Space Network (DSN) 70 m antenna, DSS-43. We study the magnetar's radio profile shape, flux density, radio spectrum, and single pulse behavior over a ~1 year period between MJDs 57233 and 57621. In particular, the magnetar exhibits a significantly negative average spectral index of $\langleÎ±\rangle$ = -1.86 $\pm$ 0.02 when the 8.4 GHz profile is single-peaked, which flattens considerably when the profile is double-peaked. We have carried out an analysis of single pulses at 8.4 GHz on MJD 57479 and find that giant pulses and pulses with multiple emission components are emitted during a significant number of rotations. We report a characteristic single pulse broadening timescale of $\langleÏ_{d}\rangle$ = 6.9 $\pm$ 0.2 ms at 8.4 GHz. We find that the pulse broadening is highly variable between emission components and cannot be explained by a thin scattering screen at distances $\gtrsim$ 1 kpc

EPIC 211964830: A transiting multi-planet system in the Praesepe open cluster (John H. Livingston - 6 September, 2018)
The NASA K2 mission has enabled the discovery of the vast majority of known planets transiting stars in clusters, providing a valuable sample of planets with known ages and radii. We present the discovery of two planets transiting EPIC 211964830, an M2 dwarf in the intermediate age (600-800 Myr) Praesepe open cluster (also known as the Beehive Cluster, M44, or NGC 2632), which was observed by K2 during Campaign 16. The planets have orbital periods of 5.8 and 19.7 days, and radii of 2.2 and 2.7 $R_\oplus$, respectively, and their equilibrium temperatures are 496 and 331 K, making this a system of two warm sub-Neptunes. When placed in the context of known planets orbiting field stars of similar mass to EPIC 211964830, these planets do not appear to have significantly inflated radii, as has previously been noted for some cluster planets. As the second known system of multiple planets transiting a star in a cluster, EPIC 211964830 should be valuable for testing theories of photoevaporation in systems of multiple planets

Unusual polarimetric properties of (101955) Bennu: similarities with F-class asteroids and cometary bodies (A. Cellino - 23 August, 2018)
We have obtained polarimetric measurements of asteroid (101955) Bennu, a presumably primitive near-Earth object (NEO) that is the target of NASA's sample return mission OSIRIS-REx. During our observing campaign, Bennu was visible from Earth under a wide range of illumination conditions, with phase-angle in the range 16 to 57 degrees. Together with (3200) Phaethon and (152679) 1998 KU2, observed very recently, Bennu is the only existing example of a primitive NEO observed in polarimetric mode over a wide interval of phase angles. From polarimetry we also derive an estimate of the geometric albedo of Bennu: 0.059 +/- 0.003.

Development of the Fabry-Perot interferometers for the HIRMES spectrometer on SOFIA (Greg Douthit - 17 August, 2018)
HIRMES is a far-infrared spectrometer that was chosen as the third generation instrument for NASA's SOFIA airborne observatory. HIRMES promises background limited performance in four modes that cover the wavelength range between 25 and 122 $Î¼$m. The mid-resolution ($R \approx 12, 000$) mode is suitable for high sensitivity imaging of galactic star formation regions in, for example, the several far-infrared fine structure lines. The low-resolution ($R \approx 2000$) imaging mode is optimized for spectroscopic mapping of far-infrared fine structure lines from nearby galaxies, while the low resolution ($R \approx 600$) grating spectrometer mode is optimized for detecting dust and ice features in protostellar and protoplanetary disks

Characterization of Low Mass K2 Planet Hosts Using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (Romy RodrÃ­guez MartÃ­nez - 10 August, 2018)
We present moderate resolution near-infrared spectra in $H, J$ and $K$ band of M dwarf hosts to candidate transiting exoplanets discovered by NASA's K2 mission. Out of an initial sample of 56 late-type stars in K2, we identify 35 objects as M dwarfs. For that sub-sample, we derive temperatures ranging from $2,870$ to $4,187$ K, radii of $0.09-0.83$ $R_{\odot}$, luminosities of $-2.67<log L/L_{\odot}<-0.67$ and [Fe/H] metallicities between $-0.49$ and $0.83$ dex. We report 33 exoplanet candidates with orbital periods ranging from 0.19 to 21.16 days, and median radii and equilibrium temperatures of 2.3 $R_{\oplus}$ and 986 K, respectively. Using planet mass-radius relationships from the literature, we identify 7 exoplanets as potentially rocky, although we conclude that probably none reside in the habitable zone of their parent stars.

How accurately can we measure the reconnection rate $E_M$ for the MMS diffusion region event of 2017-07-11? (Kevin J. Genestreti - 10 August, 2018)
We study the magnetotail electron diffusion region observed by NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) on 2017-07-11 at 22:34 UT and focus on the very large errors in $E_M$ that result from errors in an $LMN$ boundary-normal coordinate system. We find some consensus that the reconnection rate was roughly $E_M$=3.2 mV/m $\pm$ 0.06 mV/m, which corresponds to a normalized reconnection rate of $0.18\pm0.035$. When the magnetic field data has errors as small as 0.5\% of the background field strength, the $M$ direction obtained by MDD-$B$ technique may be off by as much as 35$^\circ$. Overall, we find that these techniques were able to identify $E_M$ from the virtual data within error bars $\geq$20\%.

PICO will probe the physics of the Big Bang and the energy scale of inflation, constrain the sum of neutrino masses, measure the growth of structures in the universe, and constrain its reionization history by making full sky maps of the cosmic microwave background with sensitivity 80 times higher than the Planck space mission. It gives a diffraction limited field of view (DLFOV) with throughput of 910 square cm sr at 21 GHz. The large 82 square degree DLFOV hosts 12,996 transition edge sensor bolometers distributed in 21 frequency bands and maintained at 0.1 K.

By processing the data for almost 75,000 asteroids, we derived unique shape models for about 900 of them. In total, we derived new models for 662 asteroids, which significantly increased the total number of asteroids for which their rotation state and shape are known. For another 789 asteroids, we were able to determine their sidereal rotation period and estimate the ecliptic latitude of the spin axis direction. We revealed a significant discrepancy between the number of prograde and retrograde rotators for asteroids smaller than about 10 km

Additionally, we obtain the maximum TSS and HSS values of 0.91$\pm$0.06 for predicting that a flare will not be associated with CMEs and SEPs for the 36 hour forecast window, while the 108 hour forecast window give the maximum TSS and HSS values for predicting CMEs will not be accompanying any events (TSS=HSS=0.98$\pm$0.02).

A Planetary Microlensing Event with an Unusually Red Source Star: MOA-2011-BLG-291 (David P. Bennett - 15 June, 2018)
This event is located at a low Galactic latitude in the survey area that is currently planned for NASA's WFIRST exoplanet microlensing survey. We find host star and planet masses of $M_{\rm host} =0.15^{+0.27}_{-0.10}M_\odot$ and $m_p=18^{+34}_{-12}M_\oplus$ from a Bayesian analysis with a standard Galactic model under the assumption that the planet hosting probability does not depend on the host mass or distance

The K2 M67 Study: Establishing the Limits of Stellar Rotation Period Measurements in M67 with K2 Campaign 5 Data (Rebecca Esselstein - 6 June, 2018)
The observation of M67 by NASA K2 Campaign 5 provided light curves with high enough precision to make this task possible, albeit challenging, as the pointing instability, 75d observation window, crowded field, and typically low-amplitude signals mean determining accurate rotation periods on the order of 25 - 30d is inherently difficult. Lingering, non-astrophysical signals with power at >25d found in a set of Campaign 5 A and F stars compounds the problem. To achieve a quantitative understanding of the best-case scenario limits for reliable period detection imposed by these inconveniences, we embarked on a comprehensive set of injection tests, injecting 120,000 sinusoidal signals with periods ranging from 5 to 35d and amplitudes from 0.05% to 3.0% into real Campaign 5 M67 light curves processed using two different pipelines. We find that while the reliability of detected periods is high, the completeness (sensitivity) drops rapidly with increasing period and decreasing amplitude, maxing at 15% recovery rate for the solar case (i.e. 25d period, 0.1% amplitude). This study highlights the need for caution in determining M67 rotation periods from Campaign 5 data, but this can be extended to other clusters observed by K2 and, soon, TESS.

This Final Report (FR) presents the results of the Enhanced direct imaging exoplanet detection with astrometry mass determination project, which was executed in support of NASA's Exoplanet Exploration Program and the ROSES Technology Development for Exoplanet Missions (TDEM). We have met milestone #1 with a comfortable margin. The average accuracy obtained over the three datasets is 5.75e-5 L/D, which is 4 times better than the milestone requirement, or equivalent to 2.5microarcsec on 2.4m telescope, or 1.5microarcsec for a 4m telescope, working in the visible band. We also met milestone #2 and demonstrated that it is possible to achieve high-contrast imaging utilizing a coronagraph fed by a telescope equipped with a DP, enabling dual use of the telescope. We performed three different high-contrast imaging runs and met the milestone #2 of 5e-7 raw contrast for all of them. This result is 35% better than the milestone #2 requirement

Science Impacts of the SPHEREx All-Sky Optical to Near-Infrared Spectral Survey II: Report of a Community Workshop on the Scientific Synergies Between the SPHEREx Survey and Other Astronomy Observatories (Olivier DorÃ© - 24 May, 2018)
SPHEREx is a proposed NASA MIDEX mission selected for Phase A study. At the end of its two-year mission, SPHEREx would obtain 0.75-to-5$Î¼$m spectra of every 6.2 arcsec pixel on the sky, with spectral resolution R>35 and a 5-$Ï$ sensitivity AB$>$19 per spectral/spatial resolution element. In February of 2016, some 50 scientists from all fields met in Pasadena to develop these themes and to understand their implications for the SPHEREx mission. The 2016 workshop highlighted many synergies between SPHEREx and other contemporaneous astronomical missions, facilities, and databases. Consequently, in January 2018 we convened a second workshop at the Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge to focus specifically on these synergies. This white paper reports on the results of the 2018 SPHEREx workshop.

High-Precision Orbit Fitting and Uncertainty Analysis of (486958) 2014 MU69 (Simon B. Porter - 6 May, 2018)
NASA's New Horizons spacecraft will conduct a close flyby of the cold classical Kuiper Belt Object (KBO) designated (486958) 2014 MU69 on January 1, 2019. At a heliocentric distance of 44 AU, "MU69" will be the most distant object ever visited by a spacecraft. To enable this flyby, we have developed an extremely high precision orbit fitting and uncertainty processing pipeline, making maximal use of the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) and pre-release versions of the ESA Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) catalog. This pipeline also enabled successful predictions of a stellar occultation by MU69 in July 2017. We describe how we process the WFC3 images to match the Gaia DR2 catalog, extract positional uncertainties for this extremely faint target (typically 140 photons per WFC3 exposure), and translate those uncertainties into probability distribution functions for MU69 at any given time

Asteroseismic and orbital analysis of the triple star system HD 188753 observed by Kepler (F. Marcadon - 24 April, 2018)
The NASA Kepler space telescope has detected solar-like oscillations in several hundreds of single stars, thereby providing a way to determine precise stellar parameters using asteroseismology. In this work, we aim to derive the fundamental parameters of a close triple star system, HD 188753, for which asteroseismic and astrometric observations allow independent measurements of stellar masses. We used six months of Kepler photometry available for HD 188753 to detect the oscillation envelopes of the two brightest stars. Based on stellar modelling, the mean common age of the system is $10.8 \pm 0.2\,$Gyr and the masses of the two seismic components are $M_A =$ $0.99 \pm 0.01\,M_\odot$ and $M_{Ba} =$ $0.86 \pm 0.01\,M_\odot$. From the mass ratio of the close pair, $M_{Bb}/M_{Ba} = 0.767 \pm 0.006$, the mass of the faintest star is $M_{Bb} =$ $0.66 \pm 0.01\,M_\odot$ and the total seismic mass of the system is then $M_{syst} =$ $2.51 \pm 0.02\,M_\odot$. This value agrees perfectly with the total mass derived from our orbital analysis, $M_{syst} =$ $2.51^{+0.20}_{-0.18}\,M_\odot$, and leads to the best current estimate of the parallax for the system, $Ï= 21.9 \pm 0.2\,$mas

Biases in Planet Occurrence Caused by Unresolved Binaries in Transit Surveys (L. G. Bouma - 20 April, 2018)
Wide-field surveys for transiting planets, such as the NASA Kepler and TESS missions, are usually conducted without knowing which stars have binary companions. Application of the formula to an idealized Kepler-like survey shows that for planets larger than 2 $R_\oplus$, the net systematic error is of order 5%. For smaller planets the errors are potentially larger: the occurrence of Earth-sized planets could be overestimated by as much as 50%

How big is the Sun: Solar diameter changes over time (J. P. Rozelot - 18 April, 2018)
However, with the advent of high sensitivity instruments on board satellites, such as the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SoHO) and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) aboard NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), it was possible to extract with an unprecedented accuracy the surface gravity oscillation f modes, over nearly two solar cycles, from 1996 to 2017. Even if the link between the two radii (photospheric and seismic) can be made only through modeling, such measurements provide an interesting alternative which led to a revision of the standard solar radius by the International Astronomical Union in 2015. This new look on such modern measurements of the Sun's global changes from 1996 to 2017 gives a new way for peering into the solar interior, mainly to better understand the subsurface fields which play an important role in the implementation of the solar cycles.

Mapping of Jupiter's tropospheric NH$_3$ abundance using ground-based IRTF/TEXES observations at 5 $Î¼$m (Doriann Blain - 5 June, 2018)
At the beginning of 2016, using TEXES (Texas Echelon cross-dispersed Echelle Spectrograph), mounted on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF), we obtained data cubes of Jupiter in the 1930--1943 cm$^{-1}$ spectral ranges (around 5 $Î¼$m), which probe the atmosphere in the 1--4 bar region, with a spectral resolution of $\approx$ 0.15 cm$^{-1}$ and an angular resolution of $\approx$ 1.4". The inversion retrieves the vertical abundance profiles of NH$_3$ - which is the main contributor at these wavelengths - with a maximum sensitivity at $\approx$ 1--3 bar, as well as the cloud transmittance. We present our retrieved NH$_3$ abundance maps which can be compared with the distribution observed by Juno's MWR (Bolton et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017) in the 2 bar region and discuss their significance for the understanding of Jupiter's atmospheric dynamics. We are able to show important latitudinal variations - such as in the North Equatorial Belt (NEB), where the NH$_3$ abundance is observed to drop down to 60 ppmv at 2 bar - as well as longitudinal variability. In the zones, we find the NH$_3$ abundance to increase with depth, from 100 $\pm$ 15 ppmv at 1 bar to 500 $\pm$ 30 ppmv at 3 bar. Using a simple cloud model, we are able to fit this relationship, at least in the NEB, including either NH$_3$-ice or NH$_4$SH particles with sizes between 10 and 100 $Î¼$m.

275 Candidates and 149 Validated Planets Orbiting Bright Stars in K2 Campaigns 0-10 (Andrew W. Mayo - 26 March, 2018)
Since 2014, NASA's K2 mission has observed large portions of the ecliptic plane in search of transiting planets and has detected hundreds of planet candidates. With observations planned until at least early 2018, K2 will continue to identify more planet candidates. We present here 275 planet candidates observed during Campaigns 0-10 of the K2 mission that are orbiting stars brighter than 13 mag (in Kepler band) and for which we have obtained high-resolution spectra (R = 44,000). These candidates are analyzed using the VESPA package (Morton 2012, 2015b) in order to calculate their false-positive probabilities (FPP). We find that 149 candidates are validated with an FPP lower than 0.1%, 39 of which were previously only candidates and 56 of which were previously undetected. This work, in addition to increasing the population of validated K2 planets by nearly 50% and providing new targets for follow-up observations, will also serve as a framework for validating candidates from upcoming K2 campaigns and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite, expected to launch in 2018.

Towards the First Catalog of Fermi-LAT sources below 100 MeV (Giacomo Principe - 8 February, 2018)
Below 30 MeV, the imaging Compton telescope (COMPTEL) onboard NASA's Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory detected 26 steady sources in the energy range from 0.75 to 30 MeV. At high energy, the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has detected more than three thousand sources between 100 MeV and 300 GeV. Since the Fermi LAT detects gamma rays also below 100 MeV, we apply a point source detection algorithm in the energy range between 30 MeV and 100 MeV

Variability of Disk Emission in Pre-Main Sequence and Related Stars IV. Investigating the Structural Changes in the Inner Disk Region of MWC 480 (Rachel B. Fernandes - 7 February, 2018)
We present five epochs of near IR observations of the protoplanetary disk around MWC 480 (HD31648) obtained with the SpeX spectrograph on NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) between 2007 and 2013, inclusive. Using the measured line fluxes in the Pa beta and Br gamma lines, we found the mass accretion rates to be (1.43 - 2.61)x10^-8 Msun y^-1 and (1.81 - 2.41)x10^-8 Msun y^-1 respectively, but which varied by more than 50% from epoch to epoch.

Wavefront Sensing in Space: Flight Demonstration II of the PICTURE Sounding Rocket Payload (Ewan S. Douglas - 5 February, 2018)
A NASA sounding rocket for high-contrast imaging with a visible nulling coronagraph, the PICTURE payload, has made two suborbital attempts to observe the warm dust disk inferred around Epsilon Eridani. The first flight in 2011 demonstrated a 5 milliarcsecond fine pointing system in space. The reduced flight data from the second launch, on 25 November 2015, presented herein, demonstrate active sensing of wavefront phase in space. These measurements show the actuation of a 32$\times$32-actuator microelectromechanical system deformable mirror. The wavefront sensor reached a median precision of 1.4 nanometers per pixel, with 95% of samples between 0.8 and 12.0 nanometers per pixel. The median system stability, including telescope and coronagraph wavefront errors other than tip, tilt, and piston, was 3.6 nanometers per pixel, with 95% of samples between 1.2 and 23.7 nanometers per pixel.

On-Orbit Performance of the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager Instrument onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (J. Todd Hoeksema - 5 February, 2018)
The Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) instrument is a major component of NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) spacecraft. Since beginning normal science operations on 1 May 2010, HMI has operated with remarkable continuity, e.g. during the more than five years of the SDO prime mission that ended 30 September 2015, HMI collected 98.4% of all possible 45-second velocity maps; minimizing gaps in these full-disk Dopplergrams is crucial for helioseismology.

Verification of real-time WSA-ENLIL+Cone simulations of CME arrival-time at the CCMC from 2010-2016 (A. M. Wold - 23 January, 2018)
CCMC uses the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model to predict CME arrivals at NASA missions throughout the inner heliosphere. In this work we compare model predicted CME arrival-times to in-situ ICME leading edge measurements at STEREO-A, STEREO-B, and Earth (Wind and ACE) for simulations completed between March 2010-December 2016 (over 1,800 CMEs). For all predicted CME arrivals, the hit rate is 0.5, and the false alarm rate is 0.1. For the 273 events where the CME was predicted to arrive at Earth, STEREO-A, or STEREO-B, and was actually observed (hit event), the mean absolute arrival-time prediction error was 10.4 +/- 0.9 hours, with a tendency to early prediction error of -4.0 hours. We also explore the impact of the multi-spacecraft observations used to initialize the model CME inputs by comparing model verification results before and after the STEREO-B communication loss (since September 2014) and STEREO-A sidelobe operations (August 2014-December 2015). There is an increase of 1.7 hours in the CME arrival time error during single, or limited two-viewpoint periods, compared to the three-spacecraft viewpoint period

K2-155: A Bright Metal-Poor M Dwarf with Three Transiting Super-Earths (Teruyuki Hirano - 23 January, 2018)
We report on the discovery of three transiting super-Earths around K2-155 (EPIC 210897587), a relatively bright early M dwarf ($V=12.81$ mag) observed during Campaign 13 of the NASA K2 mission. Based on the K2 light curve and the spectroscopic characterization of the host star, the planet sizes and orbital periods are $1.55_{-0.17}^{+0.20}\,R_\oplus$ and $6.34365\pm 0.00028$ days for the inner planet; $1.95_{-0.22}^{+0.27}\,R_\oplus$ and $13.85402\pm 0.00088$ days for the middle planet; and $1.64_{-0.17}^{+0.18}\,R_\oplus$ and $40.6835\pm 0.0031$ days for the outer planet. The outer planet (K2-155d) is near the habitable zone, with an insolation $1.67\pm 0.38$ times that of the Earth. We find that the planet can maintain a moderate surface temperature if the insolation proves to be smaller than $\sim 1.5$ times that of the Earth

Predicted Number, Multiplicity, and Orbital Dynamics of TESS M Dwarf Exoplanets (Sarah Ballard - 15 January, 2018)

Around stars with spectral types between M1V--M4V, we predict TESS will find 990$\pm$350 planets orbiting 715$\pm$255 stars, a 1.5-fold increase over previous predictions. Secondly, TESS will find two or more transiting planets around 20% of these host stars, a number similar to the multiplicity yield of NASA's Kepler mission. Among a typical set of 200 TESS hosts to one or more detected planets, 116$\pm$28 transiting planets will be missed. And fourth, the strong preference of TESS for systems of compact multiples indicates that TESS planets will be dynamically cooler on average than Kepler planets, with 90% of TESS-detected planets residing in orbits with $e<0.15$.

The Instruments and Capabilities of the Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) CubeSats (Christopher S. Moore - 4 January, 2018)
The Miniature X-ray Solar Spectrometer (MinXSS) CubeSat is the first solar science oriented CubeSat mission flown for the NASA Science Mission Directorate, with the main objective of measuring the solar soft X-ray (SXR) flux and a science goal of determining its influence on Earth's ionosphere and thermosphere. The MinXSS X-ray instruments consist of a spectrometer, called X123, with a nominal 0.15 keV full-width-half-maximum (FWHM) resolution at 5.9 keV and a broadband X-ray photometer, called XP. Both instruments are designed to obtain measurements from 0.5 - 30 keV at a nominal time cadence of 10 seconds. A description of the MinXSS instruments, performance capabilities, and relation to the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) 0.1 - 0.8 nm flux are discussed in this article. Early MinXSS results demonstrate the capability to measure variations of the solar spectral SXR flux between 0.8 - 12 keV from at least GOES A5 - M5 (5 $\times$ 10$^{-8}$ - 5 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ W m$^{-2}$) levels and infer physical properties (temperature and emission measure) from the MinXSS data alone

Assessing the long-term variability of acetylene and ethane in the stratosphere of Jupiter (Henrik Melin - 2 January, 2018)
We present six years of NASA IRTF TEXES mid-infrared observations of the zonally-averaged emission of methane, acetylene and ethane. The acetylene distribution falls off towards the pole, peaking at $\sim$30$^{\circ}$N with a volume mixing ratio (VMR) of $\sim$0.8 parts per million (ppm) at 1 mbar and still falling off at $\pm70^\circ$ with a VMR of $\sim$0.3 ppm. The acetylene distributions are asymmetric on average, but as we move from 2013 to 2017, the zonally-averaged abundance becomes more symmetric about the equator. Unlike acetylene, ethane has a symmetric distribution about the equator that increases toward the pole, with a peak mole fraction of $\sim$18 ppm at about $\pm50^{\circ}$ latitude, with a minimum at the equator of $\sim$10 ppm at 1 mbar

High-Spatial-Resolution K-Band Imaging of Select K2 Campaign Fields (Knicole D. ColÃ³n - 6 December, 2017)
NASA's K2 mission began observing fields along the ecliptic plane in 2014. Each observing campaign lasts approximately 80 days, during which high-precision optical photometry of select astrophysical targets is collected by the Kepler spacecraft. Due to the 4 arcsec pixel scale of the Kepler photometer, significant blending between the observed targets can occur (especially in dense fields close to the Galactic plane). We undertook a program to use the Wide Field Camera (WFCAM) on the 3.8 m United Kingdom InfraRed Telescope (UKIRT) to collect high-spatial-resolution near-infrared images of targets in select K2 campaign fields, which we report here. These 0.4 arcsec resolution K-band images offer the opportunity to perform a variety of science, including vetting exoplanet candidates by identifying nearby stars blended with the target star and estimating the size, color, and type of galaxies observed by K2.

Validation of small Kepler transiting planet candidates in or near the habitable zone (Guillermo Torres - 3 November, 2017)
A main goal of NASA's Kepler Mission is to establish the frequency of potentially habitable Earth-size planets (eta Earth). Here we report an effort to validate 18 of them statistically using the BLENDER technique, by showing that the likelihood they are true planets is far greater than that of a false positive. We take this into consideration here, and are able to validate 15 of our candidates at a 99.73% (3 sigma) significance level or higher, and the other three at slightly lower confidence. We characterize the GKM host stars using available ground-based observations and provide updated parameters for the planets, with sizes between 0.8 and 2.9 Earth radii. Seven of them (KOI-0438.02, 0463.01, 2418.01, 2626.01, 3282.01, 4036.01, and 5856.01) have a better than 50% chance of being smaller than 2 Earth radii and being in the habitable zone of their host stars.

Know the Planet, Know the Star: Precise Stellar Densities from Kepler Transit Light Curves (Emily Sandford - 1 November, 2017)
For planets with strong prior constraints on orbital eccentricity, we may measure these stellar properties directly from the light curve; this method promises to aid greatly in the characterization of transiting planet host stars targeted by the upcoming NASA TESS mission and any long-period, singly-transiting planets discovered in the same systems. Using Bayesian inference, we fit a transit model, including a nonlinear limb darkening law, to 66 Kepler transiting planet hosts to measure their stellar properties. We measure densities to within 5% for the majority of our target stars, with the dominant precision-limiting factor being the signal-to-noise ratio of the transits. 95 % of our measured stellar densities are in 3-sigma or better agreement with previously published literature values

The NIR spectrum of Carme exhibits blue slope up to 1.5 microm and is spectrally distinct from those of Himalia and Elara

Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam Survey for An Optical Counterpart of GW170817 (Nozomu Tominaga - 7 January, 2018)
While J-GEM17btc is associated with NGC 4993 that is firmly located inside the 3D skymap of GW170817, the other 59 candidates do not have distance information in the GLADE v2 catalog or NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED). Among 59 candidates, 58 are located at the center of extended objects in the Pan-STARRS1 catalog, while one candidate has an offset. The probability for J-GEM17btc is $64\%$ being much higher than those for the other 59 candidates ($9.3\times10^{-3}-2.1\times10^{-1}\%$). Furthermore, the possibility, that at least one of the other 59 candidates is located within the 3D skymap, is only $3.2\%$

Quantifying Operational Constraints of Low-Latency Telerobotics for Planetary Surface Operations (Benjamin J. Mellinkoff - 16 January, 2018)
NASA plans to use the Orion crew vehicle to transport humans between Earth and cislunar space where there will be a stationed habitat known as the Deep Space Gateway (DSG). The results from this experiment indicate that humans should operate above a threshold frame rate of 5 frames per second. In a separate, but similar experiment, we introduced a 2.6 second delay in the video system. This time delay was compared to low-latency conditions for teleoperation at the DSG ($\leq$0.4 seconds). The results from this experiment show a 150% increase in exploration time when the latency is increased to 2.6 seconds

Circumstellar ammonia in oxygen-rich evolved stars (K. T. Wong - 3 October, 2017)

We also attempted to search for the rotational transition within the $v_2=1$ state near 2 mm with the IRAM 30m Telescope towards IK Tau. Our modelling shows that the NH$_3$ abundance relative to molecular hydrogen is generally of the order of $10^{-7}$, which is a few times lower than previous estimates that were made without considering radiative pumping and is at least 10 times higher than that in the C-rich CSE of IRC +10216

Dynamic tunable notch filters for the Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) (P. Allison - 13 September, 2017)
The Antarctic Impulsive Transient Antenna (ANITA) is a NASA long-duration balloon experiment with the primary goal of detecting ultra-high-energy ($>10^{18}\,\mbox{eV}$) neutrinos via the Askaryan Effect. The fourth ANITA mission, ANITA-IV, recently flew from Dec 2 to Dec 29, 2016. The TUFF boards also performed second-stage amplification by approximately 45 dB to boost the $\sim\,Î¼\mbox{V-level}$ radio frequency (RF) signals to $\sim$ mV-level for digitization, and supplied power via bias tees to the first-stage, antenna-mounted amplifiers. They contributed to a factor of 2.8 higher total instrument livetime on average in ANITA-IV compared to ANITA-III due to reduction of narrow-band, anthropogenic noise before a trigger decision is made.

Calibration of the ART-XC mirror modules at MSFC (R. Krivonos - 31 August, 2017)
Eight X-ray mirror modules (seven flight and one spare units) for ART-XC were developed and fabricated at the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), NASA, USA. The shape of the PSF was measured with a high-resolution CCD camera installed in the focal plane with defocusing of 7 mm, as required by the ART-XC design. We used a King function to approximate the radial profile of the near on-axis PSF (Theta<9 arcmin) and an ellipse fitting procedure to describe the morphology of the far off-axis angular response (9<Theta<24 arcmin). We found a good agreement between the seven ART-XC flight mirror modules at the level of 10%. The on-axis angular resolution of the ART-XC optics varies between 27 and 33 arcsec (half-power diameter), except for the spare module.

The Formation of IRIS Diagnostics. IX. The Formation of the C I 135.58 Line in the Solar Atmosphere (Hsiao-Hsuan Lin - 30 August, 2017)
The C I 135.58 line is located in the wavelength range of NASA's Interface Region Imagin Spectrograph (IRIS) small explorer mission. The emission in the C I 135.58 line is dominated by a recombination cascade and the line forming region is optically thick. The Doppler shift of the line correlates strongly with the vertical velocity in its line forming region, which is typically located at 1.5 Mm height. With IRIS the C I 135.58 line is usually observed together with the O I 135.56 line, and from the Doppler shift of both lines, we obtain the velocity difference between the line forming regions of the two lines. We conclude that the C I 135.58 line is an excellent probe of the middle chromosphere by itself, and together with the O I 135.56 line the two lines provide even more information, which complements other powerful chromospheric diagnostics of IRIS such as the Mg II h and k lines and the C II lines around 133.5 nm.

Infrared Spectroscopy of HR 4796A's Bright Outer Cometary Ring + Tenuous Inner Hot Dust Cloud (Carey M. Lisse - 9 August, 2017)
We have obtained new NASA IRTF SpeX spectra of the HR 4796A debris ring system. Matching imaging ring photometry, we find the excess consists of NIR reflectance from the ring which is as red as that of old, processed comet nuclei, plus a tenuous thermal emission component from close-in, T ~ 850 K circumstellar material evincing an organic plus silicate emission feature complex at 7 - 13 um. Unusual, emission-like features due to atomic Si, S, Ca, and Sr were found at 0.96 - 1.07 um, likely sourced by rocky dust evaporating in the 850 K component. thermal energy for the ring with optical depth Tau > 0.10 in an 8 AU wide belt of 4 AU vertical height and Mdust > 0.1-0.7 M_Mars. Our results are consistent with HR 4796A consisting of a narrow sheparded ring of devolatilized cometary material associated with multiple rocky planetesimal subcores, and a small steady stream of dust inflowing from this belt to a rock sublimation zone at approximately 1 AU from the primary. These subcores were built from comets that have been actively emitting large, reddish dust for > 0.4 Myr at 100K, the temperature at which cometary activity onset is seen in our Solar System.

Slow motions (-50 to -20 m s$^{-1}$) were also found and remain unexplained. In addition, abundant stationary wave patterns with zonal speeds from -10 to +10 m s$^{-1}$ dominate the night upper clouds and concentrate over the regions of higher surface elevation.

Finally, we discuss the agreement within 10% of stellar masses and radii, and planet masses, radii, and orbital periods of both systems and speculate that this may be due to selection bias in searching for planets around evolved stars.

The transiting multi-planet system HD3167: a 5.7 MEarth Super-Earth and a 8.3 MEarth mini-Neptune (Davide Gandolfi - 8 June, 2017)
HD3167 is a bright (V=8.9 mag) K0V star observed by the NASA's K2 space mission during its Campaign 8. It has been recently found to host two small transiting planets, namely, HD3167b, an ultra short period (0.96 d) super-Earth, and HD3167c, a mini-Neptune on a relatively long-period orbit (29.85 d). With a mass of 5.69+/-0.44 MEarth, radius of 1.574+/-0.054 REarth, and mean density of 8.00(+1.0)(-0.98) g/cm^3, HD3167b joins the small group of ultra-short period planets known to have a rocky terrestrial composition. HD3167c has a mass of 8.33 (+1.79)(-1.85) MEarth and a radius of 2.740(+0.106)(-0.100) REarth, yielding a mean density of 2.21(+0.56)(-0.53) g/cm^3, indicative of a planet with a composition comprising a solid core surrounded by a thick atmospheric envelope. The rather large pressure scale height (about 350 km) and the brightness of the host star make HD3167c an ideal target for atmospheric characterization via transmission spectroscopy across a broad range of wavelengths

Three's Company: An additional non-transiting super-Earth in the bright HD 3167 system, and masses for all three planets (Jessie L. Christiansen - 6 June, 2017)
HD 3167 is a bright (V = 8.9), nearby K0 star observed by the NASA K2 mission (EPIC 220383386), hosting two small, short-period transiting planets. Here we present the results of a multi-site, multi-instrument radial velocity campaign to characterize the HD 3167 system. The masses of the transiting planets are 5.02+/-0.38 MEarth for HD 3167 b, a hot super-Earth with a likely rocky composition (rho_b = 5.60+2.15-1.43 g/cm^3), and 9.80+1.30-1.24 MEarth for HD 3167 c, a warm sub-Neptune with a likely substantial volatile complement (rho_c = 1.97+0.94-0.59 g/cm^3). We detect a third, non-transiting planet, HD 3167 d, with a period of 8.509+/-0.045 d (between planets b and c) and a minimum mass of 6.90+/-0.71 MEarth. We are able to constrain the mutual inclination of planet d with planets b and c: we rule out mutual inclinations below 1.3 degrees as we do not observe transits of planet d. Above 60 degrees, the system is unstable. HD 3167 promises to be a fruitful system for further study and a preview of the many exciting systems expected from the upcoming NASA TESS mission.

Spectral Evidence for an Inner Carbon-Rich Circumstellar Dust Belt in the Young HD36546 A-Star System (Carey M. Lisse - 20 April, 2017)
Using the NASA/IRTF SpeX & BASS spectrometers we have obtained novel 0.7 - 13 um observations of the newly imaged HD36546 debris disk system. The SpeX spectrum is most consistent with the photospheric emission expected from an Lstar ~ 20 Lsun, solar abundance A1.5V star with little/no extinction and excess emission from circumstellar dust detectable beyond 4.5 um. Combining the SpeX and BASS spectra with archival WISE/AKARI/IRAS/Herschel photometery, we find an outer cold dust belt at ~135K and 20 - 40 AU from the primary, likely coincident with the disk imaged by Subaru (Currie et al. 2017), and a new second inner belt with temperature ~570K and an unusual, broad SED maximum in the 6 - 9 um region, tracing dust at 1.1 - 2.2 AU. An SED maximum at 6 - 9 um has been reported in just two other A-star systems, HD131488 and HD121191, both of ~10 Myr age (Melis et al. 2013). From Spitzer, we have also identified the ~12 Myr old A7V HD148567 system as having similar 5 - 35 um excess spectral features (Mittal et al. 2015). The Spitzer data allows us to rule out water emission and rule in carbonaceous materials - organics, carbonates, SiC - as the source of the 6 - 9 um excess. Assuming a common origin for the 4 young Astar systems' disks, we suggest they are experiencing an early era of carbon-rich planetesimal processing.

We derived line-of-sight abundances and local number densities for the 5 molecular species, and line-of-sight optical depth and extinction coefficients for the haze. 2) We measured CH4 abundances from 80 to 1200 km above the surface. A joint analysis of the Alice CH4 and Alice and REX N2 measurements implied a very stable lower atmosphere with a small eddy diffusion coefficient, most likely between 550 and 4000 cm2/s. Such a small eddy diffusion coefficient placed the homopause within 12 km of the surface, giving Pluto a small planetary boundary layer. We detected local maxima in line-of-sight abundance near 410 km altitude for C2H4, near 320 km for C2H2, and an inflection point or the suggestion of a local maximum at 260 km for C2H6. We also detected local minima near 200 km altitude for C2H4, near 170 km for C2H2, and an inflection point or minimum near 170-200 km for C2H6. These compared favorably with models for hydrocarbon production near 300-400 km and haze condensation near 200 km, especially for C2H2 and C2H4 (Wong et al. 2017)

The California-Kepler Survey. I. High Resolution Spectroscopy of 1305 Stars Hosting Kepler Transiting Planets (Erik A. Petigura - 16 June, 2017)
The California-Kepler Survey (CKS) is an observational program to improve our knowledge of the properties of stars found to host transiting planets by NASA's Kepler Mission. The CKS stellar sample comprises 1305 stars classified as Kepler Objects of Interest, hosting a total of 2075 transiting planets. The primary sample is magnitude-limited (Kp < 14.2) and contains 960 stars with 1385 planets. We demonstrate a precision of 60 K in effective temperature, 0.10 dex in surface gravity, 0.04 dex in [Fe/H], and 1.0 km/s in projected rotational velocity

Global and Brazilian carbon response to El NiÃ±o Modoki 2011-2010 (K. W. Bowman - 10 March, 2017)
We quantify the global and Brazilian carbon response to this event using the NASA Carbon Monitoring System Flux (CMS-Flux) framework. The global net carbon flux tendency, which is the flux difference 2011-2010 and is positive for net fluxes into the atmosphere, was estimated to be -1.60 PgC between 2011-2010 while the Brazilian tendency was -0.24 $\pm$ 0.11 PgC. The biomass burning tendency in Brazil was -0.24 $\pm$ 0.036 PgC, which implies a near-zero change of the net ecosystem production (NEP). The near-zero change of the NEP is the result of quantitatively comparable increase in GPP (0.34 $\pm$ 0.20) and respiration in Brazil

Antarctic Surface Reflectivity Measurements from the ANITA-3 and HiCal-1 Experiments (P. W. Gorham - 21 June, 2017)
The primary science goal of the NASA-sponsored ANITA project is measurement of ultra-high energy neutrinos and cosmic rays, observed via radio-frequency signals resulting from a neutrino- or cosmic ray- interaction with terrestrial matter (atmospheric or ice molecules, e.g.). Satellite-based reflectivity surveys, at frequencies ranging from 2--45 GHz and at near-normal incidence, yield generally consistent reflectivity maps across Antarctica. Data taken with HiCal, between 200--600 MHz shows a significant departure from the Fresnel equations, constant with frequency over that band, with the deficit increasing with obliquity of incidence, which we attribute to the combined effects of possible surface roughness, surface grain effects, radar clutter and/or shadowing of the reflection zone due to Earth curvature effects.

The other two New Frontiers missions are New Horizons, which explored Pluto during a flyby in July 2015 and is on its way for a flyby of Kuiper Belt object 2014 MU69 on Jan. 1, 2019, and Juno, an orbiting mission that is studying the origin, evolution, and internal structure of Jupiter. The spacecraft departed for near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu aboard an United Launch Alliance Atlas V 411 evolved expendable launch vehicle at 7:05 p.m. EDT on September 8, 2016, on a seven-year journey to return samples from Bennu. The spacecraft is on an outbound-cruise trajectory that will result in a rendezvous with Bennu in August 2018. The science instruments on the spacecraft will survey Bennu to measure its physical, geological, and chemical properties, and the team will use these data to select a site on the surface to collect at least 60 g of asteroid regolith. The spacecraft will leave Bennu in 2021 and return the sample to the Utah Test and Training Range (UTTR) on September 24, 2023.

The radial velocity follow-up of the giant planets ($R_p > 4 \rm \, R_E$) could be achieved with SOPHIE, with a median observing time of 3.47 hours per target, and a total observing time of 305 hours that includes the 80% most favorable cases. Several small planets ($R_p < 4 \rm \, R_E$) could also be confirmed, but most of them would require an unrealistic time investment.

Stellar & Planetary Parameters for K2's Late Type Dwarf Systems from C1 to C5 (Arturo O. Martinez - 7 February, 2017)
The NASA K2 mission uses photometry to find planets transiting stars of various types. Using the SOFI spectrograph on the European Southern Observatory's New Technology Telescope, we obtained R ~ 1000 J-, H-, and K-band (0.95 - 2.52 microns) spectra of 34 late-type K2 planet and candidate planet host systems and 12 bright K4-M5 dwarfs with interferometrically measured radii and effective temperatures. Out of our 34 late-type K2 targets, we identify 27 of these stars as M dwarfs. Our calibrations provide radii and temperatures with median uncertainties of 0.059 R_sun (16.09%) and 160 K (4.33%), respectively. We find a median planet radius and an equilibrium temperature of approximately 3R_earth and 500 K, with several systems (K2-18b and K2-72e) receiving near-Earth like levels of incident irradiation.

Characterizing K2 Candidate Planetary Systems Orbiting Low-Mass Stars I: Classifying Low-mass Host Stars Observed During Campaigns 1-7 (Courtney D. Dressing - 3 January, 2017)
We present near-infrared spectra for 144 candidate planetary systems identified during Campaigns 1-7 of the NASA K2 Mission. The goal of the survey was to characterize planets orbiting low-mass stars, but our IRTF/SpeX and Palomar/TripleSpec spectroscopic observations revealed that 49% of our targets were actually giant stars or hotter dwarfs reddened by interstellar extinction. For the 72 stars with spectra consistent with classification as cool dwarfs (spectral types K3 - M4), we refined their stellar properties by applying empirical relations based on stars with interferometric radius measurements. Although our revised temperatures are generally consistent with those reported in the Ecliptic Plane Input Catalog (EPIC), our revised stellar radii are typically 0.13 solar radii (39%) larger than the EPIC values, which were based on model isochrones that have been shown to underestimate the radii of cool dwarfs

Sulfur Hazes in Giant Exoplanet Atmospheres: Impacts on Reflected Light Spectra (Peter Gao - 24 February, 2017)
We investigate the impact such a haze would have on an exoplanet's geometric albedo spectrum and how it may affect the direct imaging results of WFIRST, a planned NASA space telescope. For temperate (250 K $<$ T$_{\rm eq}$ $<$ 700 K) Jupiter--mass planets, photochemical destruction of H$_{2}$S results in the production of $\sim$1 ppmv of \seight between 100 and 0.1 mbar, which, if cool enough, will condense to form a haze. Nominal haze masses are found to drastically alter a planet's geometric albedo spectrum: whereas a clear atmosphere is dark at wavelengths between 0.5 and 1 $Î¼$m due to molecular absorption, the addition of a sulfur haze boosts the albedo there to $\sim$0.7 due to scattering. Strong absorption by the haze shortward of 0.4 $Î¼$m results in albedos $<$0.1, in contrast to the high albedos produced by Rayleigh scattering in a clear atmosphere. Detection of such a haze by WFIRST is possible, though discriminating between a sulfur haze and any other highly reflective, high altitude scatterer will require observations shortward of 0.4 $Î¼$m, which is currently beyond WFIRST's design.

The abundance of C2H4 in the circumstellar envelope of IRC+10216 (J. P. Fonfria - 5 January, 2017)
High spectral resolution mid-IR observations of ethylene (C2H4) towards the AGB star IRC+10216 were obtained using the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). Eighty ro-vibrational lines from the 10.5 um vibrational mode nu7 with J<30 were detected in absorption. The observed lines are divided into two groups with rotational temperatures of 105 and 400 K (warm and hot lines). The hot lines are centered at -10 km/s indicating that they come from a shell between 10 and 20R*. 35% of the observed lines are unblended and can be fitted with a code developed to model the emission of a spherically symmetric circumstellar envelope. The total column density is 6.5(3.0)E15 cm^-2. One of the scenarios that best reproduce the observations suggests that up to 25% of the C2H4 molecules at 20R* could condense onto dust grains

The K2 Galactic Archaeology Program Data Release 1: Asteroseismic results from Campaign 1 (D. Stello - 29 November, 2016)
NASA's K2 mission is observing tens of thousands of stars along the ecliptic, providing data suitable for large scale asteroseismic analyses to inform galactic archaeology studies. Here we report the asteroseismic analysis of all stars selected by the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program during the mission's "North Galactic Cap" campaign 1. From the full target sample of 8630 stars we find about 1200 oscillating red giants, a number comparable with estimates from galactic synthesis modeling. Thus, as a valuable by-product we find roughly 7500 stars to be dwarfs, which provide a sample well suited for galactic exoplanet occurrence studies because they originate from our simple and easily reproducible selection function. We find the sample is at least near complete for stars with 40 < numax/microHz < 270, and numax_detec < 2.6*1e6 * 2e-Kp microHz. There is a detection bias against helium core burning stars with numax ~ 30 microHz, affecting the number of measurements of DeltaNu and possibly also numax. Although we can detect oscillations down to Kp = 15, our campaign 1 sample lacks enough faint giants to assess the detection completeness for stars fainter than Kp ~ 14.5.

Intensity mapping of H-alpha, H-beta, [OII] and [OIII] lines at z<5 (Yan Gong - 22 December, 2016)

We also investigate the cross correlation with the 21-cm line probed by CHIME (the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment), Tianlai experiment and SKA (the Square Kilometer Array) at 0.8<z<2.4. We find both the auto and cross power spectra can be well measured for the H-alpha, [OIII] and [OII] lines at z<3, while it is more challenging for the H-beta line. Finally, we estimate the constraint on the SFRD from intensity mapping, and find we can reach accuracy higher than 7% at z<4, which is better than usual measurements using the LFs of galaxies.

A population of planetary systems characterized by short-period, Earth-sized planets (Jason H. Steffen - 11 October, 2016)
We analyze data from the Quarter 1-17 Data Release 24 (Q1--Q17 DR24) planet candidate catalog from NASA's Kepler mission, specifically comparing systems with single transiting planets to systems with multiple transiting planets, and identify a distinct population of exoplanets with a necessarily distinct system architecture. We estimate that at least 24 of the 144 systems we examined (>~17%) are members of this population

Detection of Water and/or Hydroxyl on Asteroid (16) Psyche (Driss Takir - 3 October, 2016)
In order to search for evidence of hydration on M-type asteroid (16) Psyche, we observed this object in the 3 micron spectral region using the long-wavelength cross-dispersed (LXD: 1.9-4.2 micron) mode of the SpeX spectrograph/imager at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). Our observations show that Psyche exhibits a 3 micron absorption feature, attributed to water or hydroxyl. The 3 micron absorption feature is consistent with the hydration features found on the surfaces of water-rich asteroids, attributed to OH- and/or H2O-bearing phases (phyllosilicates). The detection of a 3 micron hydration absorption band on Psyche suggests that this asteroid may not be metallic core, or it could be a metallic core that has been impacted by carbonaceous material over the past 4.5 Gyr

The Surface Roughness of (433) Eros as Measured by Thermal-Infrared Beaming (Ben Rozitis - 22 September, 2016)
the target of NASA's NEAR Shoemaker mission) when using the Advanced Thermophysical Model with thermal-infrared observations taken during an "almost pole-on" illumination and viewing geometry. It is found that the surface roughness of (433) Eros is characterised by an RMS slope of 38 $\pm$ 8Â° at the 0.5-cm spatial scale associated with its thermal-infrared beaming effect. This is slightly greater than the RMS slope of 25 $\pm$ 5Â° implied by the NEAR Shoemaker laser ranging results when extrapolated to this spatial scale, and indicates that other surface shaping processes might operate, in addition to collisions and gravity, at spatial scales under one metre in order to make asteroid surfaces rougher

On the influence of impact effect modelling for global asteroid impact risk distribution (Clemens M. Rumpf - 24 August, 2016)
ESA and NASA maintain asteroid hazard lists that contain all known asteroids with a non zero chance of colliding with the Earth in the future. The Asteroid Risk Mitigation Optimization and Research (ARMOR) tool, in conjunction with the freely available software OrbFit, was used to project the impact probabilities of listed asteroids with a minimum diameter of 30 m onto the surface of the Earth representing a random sample (15% of all objects) of the hazard list. The resulting 261 impact corridors were visualized on a global map. Furthermore, the impact corridors were combined with Earth population data to estimate the simplified risk (without impact effects) and advanced risk (with impact effects) associated with the direct asteroid impacts that each nation faces from present to 2100 based on this sample. The relationship between risk and population size was examined for the 40 most populous countries and it was apparent that population size is a good proxy for relative risk

We study the spectrophotometric properties of dwarf planet Ceres in the VIS-IR spectral range by means of hyper-spectral images acquired by the VIR imaging spectrometer on board the NASA Dawn mission. The single-scattering albedo and the asymmetry parameter at 0.55$Î¼$m are $w=0.14\pm0.02$ and $Î¾=-0.11\pm0.08$, respectively (two-lobe Henyey-Greenstein phase function); the modeled geometric albedo is $0.094\pm0.007$; the roughness parameter is $\barÎ¸=29^{\circ}\pm6^{\circ}$. Albedo maps indicate small variability on a global scale with an average reflectance of $0.034 \pm 0.003$. We measure a significant spectral phase reddening, and the average spectral slope of Ceres' surface after photometric correction is $1.1\%kÃ^{-1}$ and $0.85\%kÃ^{-1}$ at VIS and IR wavelengths, respectively

197 Candidates and 104 Validated Planets in K2's First Five Fields (Ian J. M. Crossfield - 26 July, 2016)
We present 197 planet candidates discovered using data from the first year of the NASA K2 mission (Campaigns 0-4), along with the results of an intensive program of photometric analyses, stellar spectroscopy, high-resolution imaging, and statistical validation. We distill these candidates into sets of 104 validated planets (57 in multi-planet systems), 30 false positives, and 63 remaining candidates. Our validated systems span a range of properties, with median values of R_P = 2.3 R_E, P=8.6 d, Tef = 5300 K, and Kp=12.7 mag. We show that K2 has increased by 30% the number of small planets known to orbit moderately bright stars (1-4 R_E, Kp=9-13 mag). Of particular interest are 37 planets smaller than 2 R_E, 15 orbiting stars brighter than Kp=11.5, five receiving Earth-like irradiation levels, and several multi-planet systems -- including four planets orbiting the M dwarf K2-72 near mean-motion resonances. By quantifying the likelihood that each candidate is a planet we demonstrate that our candidate sample has an overall false positive rate of 15-30%, with rates substantially lower for small candidates (< 2 R_E) and larger for candidates with radii > 8 R_E and/or with P < 3 d

Enhanced association and dissociation of heteronuclear Feshbach molecules in a microgravity environment (J. P. D&#39;Incao - 15 July, 2016)
We study the association and dissociation dynamics of weakly bound heteronuclear Feshbach molecules using transverse RF-fields for expected parameters accessible through the microgravity environment of NASA's Cold Atom Laboratory (CAL) aboard the International Space Station, including temperatures at or below nK and atomic densities as low as $10^8$/cm$^3$. We show that under such conditions, thermal and loss effects can be greatly suppressed resulting in high efficiency in both association and dissociation of Feshbach molecules with mean size exceeding 10$^4a_0$, and allowing for the coherence in atom-molecule transitions to be clearly observable. We derive the temperature, density and scattering length regimes of $^{41}$K-$^{87}$Rb that allow optimal association/dissociation efficiency with minimal heating and loss to guide future experiments with ultracold atomic gases in space.

Mid-Infrared Mapping of Jupiter's Temperatures, Aerosol Opacity and Chemical Distributions with IRTF/TEXES (L. N. Fletcher - 13 June, 2017)
Global maps of Jupiter's atmospheric temperatures, gaseous composition and aerosol opacity are derived from a programme of 5-20 $Î¼$m mid-infrared spectroscopic observations using the Texas Echelon Cross Echelle Spectrograph (TEXES) on NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). Image cubes from December 2014 in eight spectral channels, with spectral resolutions of $R\sim2000-12000$ and spatial resolutions of $2-4^\circ$ latitude, are inverted to generate 3D maps of tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures, 2D maps of upper tropospheric aerosols, phosphine and ammonia, and 2D maps of stratospheric ethane and acetylene. The results are compared to a re-analysis of Cassini Composite Infrared Spectrometer (CIRS) observations acquired during Cassini's closest approach to Jupiter in December 2000, demonstrating that this new archive of ground-based mapping spectroscopy can match and surpass the quality of previous investigations, and will permit future studies of Jupiter's evolving atmosphere. Jupiter's stratosphere is notably warmer at northern mid-latitudes than in the south in both 2000 and 2014

Overall, the lead authors of these publications have their affiliations for 45% in Europe, 29% in the Americas, 24% in Australasia, and 2% in Africa and Arab countries. Publications most frequently appear (in decreasing order) in the Astrophysical Journal, the Journal of Geophysical Research (Space Physics), Solar Physics, Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Advances in Space Research (adding up to 59% of all publications in 2015).

Precise Near-Infrared Radial Velocities (Peter Plavchan - 18 March, 2016)
We use the CSHELL spectrograph (R ~46,000) at the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility, combined with an isotopic methane absorption gas cell for common optical path relative wavelength calibration. With a spectral grasp of only 5 nm, we are able to reach long-term radial velocity dispersions of ~20-30 m/s on our survey targets.

A High-Precision NIR Survey for RV Variable Low-Mass Stars (Jonathan GagnÃ© - 18 March, 2016)
We present the results of a precise near-infrared (NIR) radial velocity (RV) survey of 32 low-mass stars with spectral types K2-M4 using CSHELL at the NASA IRTF in the $K$-band with an isotopologue methane gas cell to achieve wavelength calibration and a novel iterative RV extraction method. We surveyed 14 members of young ($\approx$ 25-150 Myr) moving groups, the young field star $\varepsilon$ Eridani as well as 18 nearby ($<$ 25 pc) low-mass stars and achieved typical single-measurement precisions of 8-15 m s$^{-1}$ with a long-term stability of 15-50 m s$^{-1}$. We obtain the best NIR RV constraints to date on 27 targets in our sample, 19 of which were never followed by high-precision RV surveys. Our results indicate that very active stars can display long-term RV variations as low as $\sim$ 25-50 m s$^{-1}$ at $\approx$ 2.3125 $Î¼$m, thus constraining the effect of jitter at these wavelengths. We provide the first multi-wavelength confirmation of GJ 876 bc and independently retrieve orbital parameters consistent with previous studies. We recovered RV variability for HD 160934 AB and GJ 725 AB that are consistent with their known binary orbits, and nine other targets are candidate RV variables with a statistical significance of 3-5$Ï$. Our method combined with the new iSHELL spectrograph will yield long-term RV precisions of $\lesssim$ 5 m s$^{-1}$ in the NIR, which will allow the detection of Super-Earths near the habitable zone of mid-M dwarfs.

Retrieval of Precise Radial Velocities from Near-Infrared High Resolution Spectra of Low Mass Stars (Peter Gao - 18 March, 2016)
In this work we describe and test a novel RV extraction pipeline dedicated to retrieving RVs from low mass stars using NIR spectra taken by the CSHELL spectrograph at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, where a methane isotopologue gas cell is used for wavelength calibration. Despite limitations from CSHELL's narrow wavelength range and instrumental systematics, we are able to (1) obtain an RV precision of 35 m/s for the RV standard star GJ 15 A over a time baseline of 817 days, reaching the photon noise limit for our attained SNR, (2) achieve ~3 m/s RV precision for the M giant SV Peg over a baseline of several days and confirm its long-term RV trend due to stellar pulsations, as well as obtain nightly noise floors of ~2 - 6 m/s, and (3) show that our data are consistent with the known masses, periods, and orbital eccentricities of the two most massive planets orbiting GJ 876

Efficient Geometric Probabilities of Multi-Transiting Exoplanetary Systems from CORBITS (Joshua Brakensiek - 22 February, 2016)
NASA's Kepler Space Telescope has successfully discovered thousands of exoplanet candidates using the transit method, including hundreds of stars with multiple transiting planets. The algorithm applies theorems of elementary differential geometry to compute the areas bounded by circular curves on the surface of a sphere (see Ragozzine & Holman 2010). We use CORBITS to show that the present solar system would only show a maximum of 3 transiting planets, but that this varies over time due to dynamical evolution

The reversal of the Sun's magnetic field in cycle 24 (Alexander V. Mordvinov - 7 February, 2016)
Analysis of synoptic data from the Vector Stokes Magnetograph (VSM) of the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun (SOLIS) and the NASA/NSO Spectromagnetograph (SPM) at the NSO/Kitt Peak Vacuum Telescope facility shows that the reversals of solar polar magnetic fields exhibit elements of a stochastic process, which may include the development of specific patterns of emerging magnetic flux, and the asymmetry in activity between northern and southern hemispheres. We demonstrate that the activity occurring during the current cycle 24 may be the result of this randomness in the evolution of the solar surface magnetic field.

New Horizons Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) Observations of the Solar Wind From 11-33 AU (H. A. Elliott - 26 January, 2016)
The Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument on NASA's New Horizon Pluto mission has collected solar wind observations en route from Earth to Pluto, and these observations continue beyond Pluto. Comparisons between SWAP parameters and both propagated 1 AU observations and prior Voyager 2 observations indicate consistency in both the range and mean wind values. At times the T-V correlation clearly breaks down beyond 20 AU, which may indicate wind currently expanding and cooling may have an elevated T reflecting prior heating and compression in the inner heliosphere. The solar rotation periodicity is present in temperature beyond 20 AU indicating the observed parcel temperature may reflect not only current heating or cooling, but also heating occurring closer to the Sun.

Pluto's atmosphere from the 29 June 2015 ground-based stellar occultation at the time of the New Horizons flyby (B. Sicardy - 1 March, 2016)

We find that Pluto's atmosphere is still expanding, with a significant pressure increase of 5$\pm$2\% since 2013 and a factor of almost three since 1988. The flash shape and amplitude are compatible with a spherical and transparent atmospheric layer of roughly 3~km in thickness whose base lies at about 4~km above Pluto's surface, and where an average thermal gradient of about 5 K~km$^{-1}$ prevails

CALET: a high energy astroparticle physics experiment on the ISS (Pier Simone Marrocchesi - 25 December, 2015)
CALET (CALorimetric Electron Telescope) is a high energy astroparticle physics experiment planned for a long exposure mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS) by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency, in collaboration with the Italian Space Agency (ASI) and NASA. The main science goal is high precision measurements of the inclusive electron (+positron) spectrum below 1 TeV and the exploration of the energy region above 1 TeV, where the shape of the high end of the spectrum might unveil the presence of nearby sources of acceleration. CALET has been designed to achieve a large proton rejection capability (>10$^5$) with a fine grained imaging calorimeter (IMC) followed by a total absorption calorimeter (TASC), for a total thickness of 30 X$_{0}$ and 1.3 proton interaction length. CALET will also measure the high energy spectra and relative abundance of cosmic nuclei from proton to iron and detect trans-iron elements up to Z$\sim$40. CALET will also contribute to clarify the present experimental picture on the energy dependence of the boron/carbon ratio, below and above 1 TeV/n, thereby providing valuable information on cosmic-ray propagation in the galaxy

That's How We Roll: The NASA K2 Mission Science Products and Their Performance Metrics (Jeffrey E. Van Cleve - 25 February, 2016)
NASA's exoplanet Discovery mission Kepler was reconstituted as the K2 mission a year after the failure of the 2nd of Kepler's 4 reaction wheels in May 2013. The new spacecraft pointing method now gives typical roll motion of 1.0 pixels peak-to-peak over 6 hours at the edges of the field, two orders of magnitude greater than for Kepler. At the center, where roll motion is nearly negligible, the limiting 6 hour photometric precision for a quiet 12th magnitude star can be as low as 30 ppm, only 25% higher than that of Kepler. This noise performance is achieved without sacrificing signal fidelity; test sinusoids injected into the data are attenuated by less than 10% for signals with periods up 15 days. At time scales relevant to asteroseismology, light curves derived from K2 archive calibrated pixels have high-frequency noise amplitude within 40% of that achieved by Kepler. The improvements in K2 operations and science data analysis resulting from 1.5 yr of experience with this new mission concept, and quantified by the metrics in this paper, will support continuation of K2's already high level of scientific productivity in an extended K2 mission.

In 49 of 54 systems we validated the primary as the host star.

Preprocessing Solar Images while Preserving their Latent Structure (Nathan M Stein - 14 December, 2015)
Telescopes such as the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory, a NASA satellite, collect massive streams of high resolution images of the Sun through multiple wavelength filters. This allows users to avoid the Poisson inverse problem altogether or to tackle it on each of $\sim$10 segments rather than on each of $\sim$10$^7$ pixels, reducing computing time by a factor of $\sim$10$^6$. We illustrate our method by segmenting images of a coronal hole observed on 26 February 2015.

Transiting the Sun II: The impact of stellar activity on Lyman-$Î±$ transits (J Llama - 10 December, 2015)
Here we insert transits of a hot Jupiter into continuous disk integrated data of the Sun in Lyman-alpha (Ly$Î±$) from NASA's SDO/EVE instrument to assess the impact of stellar activity on the measured planet-to-star radius ratio $(\textrm{R}_\textrm{p}/\textrm{R}_\star)$. In 75% of our simulated light curves we measure the correct radius ratio; however, incorrect values can be measured if there is significant short term variability in the light curve. The maximum measured value of $(\textrm{R}_\textrm{p}/\textrm{R}_\star)$ is $50\%$ larger than the input value, which is much smaller than the large Ly$Î±$ transit depths that have been reported in the literature, suggesting that for stars with activity levels comparable to the Sun, stellar activity alone cannot account for these deep transits. We ran simulations without a transit and found that stellar activity cannot mimic the Ly$Î±$ transit of 55 Cancari b, strengthening the conclusion that this planet has a partially transiting exopshere. In the higher variability data, the largest value of $(\textrm{R}_\textrm{p}/\textrm{R}_\star)$ we measured is < 3x the input value which again is not large enough to reproduce the Ly$Î±$ transit depth reported for the more active stars HD 189733 and GJ 436, supporting the interpretation that these planets have extended atmospheres and possible cometary tails.

Planet Hunters. VIII. Characterization of 41 Long-Period Exoplanet Candidates from Kepler Archival Data (Ji Wang - 17 December, 2015)
Stellar properties for other stars are obtained from the NASA Exoplanet Archive and the Kepler Stellar Catalog by Huber et al. We validate 7 planet candidates that have planet confidence over 0.997 (3-Ï level). These validated planets include 3 single-transit planets (KIC-3558849b, KIC-5951458b, and KIC-8540376c), 3 planets with double transits (KIC-8540376b, KIC-9663113b, and KIC-10525077b), and 1 planet with 4 transits (KIC-5437945b). This work provides assessment regarding the existence of planets at wide separations and the associated false positive rate for transiting observation (17%-33%). More than half of the long-period planets with at least three transits in this paper exhibit transit timing variations up to 41 hours, which suggest additional components that dynamically interact with the transiting planet candidates

IRTF/SPEX Observations of the Unusual Kepler Lightcurve System KIC8462852 (C. M. Lisse - 30 November, 2015)
We have utilized the NASA IRTF 3m SpeX instrument's high resolution spectral mode (Rayner et al. 2003) to observe and characterize the near-infrared flux emanating from the unusual Kepler lightcurve system KIC8462852. By comparing the resulting 0.8 to 4.2 um spectrum to a mesh of model photospheric spectra, the 6 emission line analysis of the Rayner et al. 2009 catalogue, and the 25 system collection of debris disks we have observed to date using SpeX under the Near InfraRed Debris disk Survey (NIRDS; Lisse et al. 2016), we have been able to additionally characterize the system. We speculate that KIC8462852, like the approximately 1.4 Gyr old F2V system Î· Corvi (Wyatt et al. 2005, Chen et al. 2006, Lisse et al. 2012), is undergoing a Late Heavy Bombardment, but is only in its very early stages.

Size and albedo distributions of asteroids in cometary orbits using WISE data (J. Licandro - 8 October, 2015)
We study the distributions of effective diameter ($D$), beaming parameter ($Î·$), and visible geometric albedo ($p_V$) of asteroids in cometry orbits (ACOs) populations, derived from NASA's Wide-field Infrared Explorer (WISE) observations, and compare these with the same, independently determined properties of the comets. We obtained $D$ and $p_V$ for 49 ACOs in Jupiter family cometary orbits (JF-ACOs) and 16 ACOs in Halley-type orbits (Damocloids). We also obtained $Î·$ for 45 of them. All but three JF-ACOs (95% of the sample) present a low albedo compatible with a cometary origin. For the entire sample of ACOs, the mean geometric albedo is $\bar{p_V} = 0.05 \pm 0.02$, ($\bar{p_V} = 0.05 \pm 0.01$ and $\bar{p_V} =0.05 \pm 0.02$ for JF-ACOs and Damocloids, respectively) compatible with a narrow albedo distribution similar to that of the Jupiter family comets (JFCs), with a $\bar{p_V} \sim 0.04$. The $\barÎ· =1.0 \pm 0.2$. Although the Centaur sample contains larger objects, the linear parts in their log-log plot of the CSDs presents a similar cumulative exponent ($Î²= 1.85 \pm 0.30$ and $1.76 \pm 0.35$, respectively).

The Formation of IRIS Diagnostics. VII. The Formation of the OI 135.56 nm Line in the Solar Atmosphere (Hsiao-Hsuan Lin - 22 September, 2015)
The O I 135.56 nm line is covered by NASA's Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) small explorer mission which studies how the solar atmosphere is energized. We study the basic formation mechanisms and derive a quintessential model atom that incorporates the essential atomic physics for the formation of the O I 135.56 nm line. This atomic model has 16 levels and describes recombination cascades through highly excited levels by effective recombination rates. The emission in the O I 135.56 nm line is dominated by a recombination cascade and the line is optically thin. The Doppler shift of the maximum emission correlates strongly with the vertical velocity in its line forming region, which is typically located at 1.0 - 1.5 Mm height. Since the O I 135.56 nm line is optically thin, the width of the emission line is a very good diagnostic of non-thermal velocities. We conclude that the O I 135.56 nm line is an excellent probe of the middle chromosphere, and compliments other powerful chromospheric diagnostics of IRIS such as the Mg II h & k lines and the C II lines around 133.5 nm.

On the surface composition of Triton's southern latitudes (B. J. Holler - 20 November, 2015)
Between 2002 and 2014, we obtained 63 nights of near-infrared (0.67-2.55 $Î¼$m) spectra using the SpeX instrument at NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF). Absorption features of ethane (C$_2$H$_6$) and $^{13}$CO are coincident at 2.405 $Î¼$m, a feature that we detect in our spectra. The longitudinal distribution of the 2.405 $Î¼$m band shows little variability over one Triton rotation and is 97$\pm$44$^{\circ}$ and 92$\pm$44$^{\circ}$ out of phase with the 1.58 $Î¼$m and 2.35 $Î¼$m CO bands, respectively. This evidence indicates that the 2.405 $Î¼$m band is due to absorption from non-volatile ethane

SOFIA Infrared Spectrophotometry of Comet C/2012 K1 (Pan-STARRS) (Charles E. Woodward - 2 August, 2015)
We present pre-perihelion infrared 8 to 31 micron spectrophotometric and imaging observations of comet C/2012 K1 (Pan-STARRS), a dynamically new Oort Cloud comet, conducted with NASA's Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) facility (+FORCAST) in 2014 June. The comet exhibited a weak 10 micron silicate feature ~1.18 +/- 0.03 above the underlying best-fit 215.32 +/- 0.95 K continuum blackbody. Thermal modeling of the observed spectral energy distribution indicates that the coma grains are fractally solid with a porosity factor D = 3 and the peak in the grain size distribution, a_peak = 0.6 micron, large. The sub-micron coma grains are dominated by amorphous carbon, with a silicate-to-carbon ratio of 0.80 (+0.25) (- 0.20). The silicate crystalline mass fraction is 0.20 (+0.30) (-0.10), similar to with other dynamically new comets exhibiting weak 10 micron silicate features. The bolometric dust albedo of the coma dust is 0.14 +/- 0.01 at a phase angle of 34.76 degrees, and the average dust production rate, corrected to zero phase, at the epoch of our observations was Afrho ~ 5340~cm.

Two Transiting Earth-size Planets Near Resonance Orbiting a Nearby Cool Star (Erik A. Petigura - 14 September, 2015)
We detected the transiting planets in photometry collected during Campaign 3 of NASA's K2 mission. Analysis of transit light curves reveals that the planets have small radii compared to their host star, 2.60 $\pm$ 0.14% and 3.15 $\pm$ 0.20%, respectively. We obtained follow up NIR spectroscopy of K2-21 to constrain host star properties, which imply planet sizes of 1.59 $\pm$ 0.43 Earth-radii and 1.92 $\pm$ 0.53 Earth-radii, respectively, straddling the boundary between high-density, rocky planets and low-density planets with thick gaseous envelopes. The planets have orbital periods of 9.32414 days and 15.50120 days, respectively, and have a period ratio of 1.6624, very near to the 5:3 mean motion resonance, which may be a record of the system's formation history

Detecting and Constraining N$_2$ Abundances in Planetary Atmospheres Using Collisional Pairs (Edward W. Schwieterman - 28 July, 2015)
By comparing spectra from NASA$'$s EPOXI mission to synthetic spectra from the NASA Astrobiology Institute$'$s Virtual Planetary Laboratory three-dimensional spectral Earth model, we find that (N$_2$)$_2$ absorption produces a ~35$\%$ decrease in flux at 4.15 $Î¼$m. We show that (N$_2$)$_2$ absorption in the wings of the 4.3 $Î¼$m CO$_2$ band is strongly dependent on N$_2$ partial pressures above 0.5 bar and can significantly widen this band in thick N$_2$ atmospheres. The (N$_2$)$_2$ transit transmission signal is up to 10 ppm for an Earth-size planet with an N$_2$-dominated atmosphere orbiting within the HZ of an M5V star and could be substantially larger for planets with significant H$_2$ mixing ratios.

Limb Event Brightenings and Fast Ejection Using IRIS Mission Observations (E. Tavabi - 30 September, 2015)
The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) of the NASA small explorer mission provides significantly more complete and higher resolution spectral coverage of the dynamical conditions inside the chromosphere and transition region (TR) than has heretofore been available. Near the solar limb high temporal, spatial (0.3") and spectral resolution observations from the ultraviolet IRIS spectra reveal high-energy limb event brightenings (LEBs) at low chromospheric heights, around 1 Mm above the limb. We selected two events showing spectra of a confined eruption just off or near the quiet Sun limb, the jet part showing obvious moving material with short duration large Doppler shifts in three directions identified as macrospicules on slit-jaw (SJ) images in Si IV and He II 304 A. Shifts correspond to velocities of up to 100 km/s in projection on the plane of the sky

Discovery and Validation of Kepler-452b: A 1.6-Re Super Earth Exoplanet in the Habitable Zone of a G2 Star (Jon M. Jenkins - 23 July, 2015)
We report on the discovery and validation of Kepler-452b, a transiting planet identified by a search through the 4 years of data collected by NASA's Kepler Mission. This possibly rocky 1.63$^{+0.23}_{-0.20}$ R$_\oplus$ planet orbits its G2 host star every 384.843$^{+0.007}_{0.012}$ days, the longest orbital period for a small (R$_p$ < 2 R$_\oplus$) transiting exoplanet to date. The likelihood that this planet has a rocky composition lies between 49% and 62%. The star has an effective temperature of 5757$\pm$85 K and a log g of 4.32$\pm$0.09. At a mean orbital separation of 1.046$^{+0.019}_{-0.015}$ AU, this small planet is well within the optimistic habitable zone of its star (recent Venus/early Mars), experiencing only 10% more flux than Earth receives from the Sun today, and slightly outside the conservative habitable zone (runaway greenhouse/maximum greenhouse). The star is slightly larger and older than the Sun, with a present radius of 1.11$^{+0.15}_{-0.09}$ R$_\odot$ and an estimated age of 6 Gyr. Thus, Kepler-452b has likely always been in the habitable zone and should remain there for another 3 Gyr.

We present high spectral resolution mid-IR observations of SiS towards the C-rich AGB star IRC+10216 carried out with the Texas Echelon-cross-Echelle Spectrograph mounted on the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. We have identified 204 ro-vibrational lines of 28Si32S, 26 of 29Si32S, 20 of 28Si34S, and 15 of 30Si32S in the frequency range 720-790 cm-1. These lines belong to bands v=1-0, 2-1, 3-2, 4-3, and 5-4, and involve rotational levels with Jlow<90. About 30 per cent of these lines are unblended or weakly blended and can be partially or entirely fitted with a code developed to model the mid-IR emission of a spherically symmetric circumstellar envelope composed of expanding gas and dust. The fits are compatible with an expansion velocity of 1+2.5(r/R*-1) km/s between 1 and 5R*, 11 km/s between 5 and 20R*, and 14.5 km/s outwards. The derived isotopic ratios 28Si/29Si, and 32S/34S are 17 and 14, compatible with previous estimates.

We estimated z for GRBs 941017 and 970111 using GRB 990123--with z=1.61--as a reference. The estimated z for GRB 941017 is typical for long GRBs and the estimated z for GRB 970111 is right in the range of the expected values for this burst.

We present the first detections by the NASA K2 Mission of oscillations in solar-type stars, using short-cadence data collected during K2 Campaign\,1 (C1). We understand the asteroseismic detection thresholds for C1-like levels of photometric performance, and we can detect oscillations in subgiants having dominant oscillation frequencies around $1000\,\rm Î¼Hz$. A reduction in the excess high-frequency noise by a factor of two-and-a-half in amplitude would bring main-sequence stars with dominant oscillation frequencies as high as ${\simeq 2500}\,\rm Î¼Hz$ into play as potential asteroseismic targets for K2.

Composition of Potentially Hazardous Asteroid (214869) 2007 PA8: An H Chondrite from the Outer Asteroid Belt (Juan A. Sanchez - 3 July, 2015)
In this study we present near-infrared spectra (0.7-2.55 microns) of PHA (214869) 2007 PA8 obtained with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility during its close approach to Earth on November 2012. In particular, we found that the olivine and pyroxene chemistries of 2007 PA8 are Fa18(Fo82) and Fs16, respectively. The olivine-pyroxene abundance ratio was estimated to be 47%. This low olivine abundance and the measured band parameters, close to the H4 and H5 chondrites, suggest that the parent body of 2007 PA8 experienced thermal metamorphism before being catastrophically disrupted. Based on the compositional affinity, proximity to the J5:2 resonance, and estimated flux of resonant objects we determined that the Koronis family is the most likely source region for 2007 PA8.

Oxygen Isotopic Composition of Coarse- and Fine-grained Material from Comet 81P/Wild 2 (Ryan C. Ogliore - 15 June, 2015)
Individual particles from comet 81P/Wild 2 collected by NASA's Stardust mission vary in size from small sub-$Î¼$m fragments found in the walls of the aerogel tracks, to large fragments up to tens of $Î¼$m in size found towards the termini of tracks. We measured the O isotopic composition of seven Stardust fragments larger than $\sim$2 $Î¼$m extracted from five different Stardust aerogel tracks, and 63 particles smaller than $\sim$2 $Î¼$m from the wall of a Stardust track. The larger particles show a relatively narrow range of O isotopic compositions that is consistent with $^{16}$O-poor phases commonly seen in meteorites. The fine-grained material shows a very broad range of O isotopic compositions ($-70<Î^{17}$O$<+60$) suggesting that Wild 2 fines are either primitive outer-nebula dust or a very diverse sampling of inner Solar System compositional reservoirs that accreted along with a large number of inner-Solar-System rocks to form comet Wild 2.

Distribution of CO2 ice on the large moons of Uranus and evidence for compositional stratification of their near-surfaces (Richard J. Cartwright - 15 June, 2015)

Additionally, we made spectrophotometric measurements using images gathered by the Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope (2003 - 2005). Thus, our combined SpeX and IRAC analyses suggest that the near-surfaces (i.e., top few 100 microns) of the Uranian satellites are compositionally stratified

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is a NASA-sponsored Explorer mission that will perform a wide-field survey for planets that transit bright host stars. We expect that TESS will find approximately 1700 transiting planets from 200,000 pre-selected target stars. This includes 556 planets smaller than twice the size of Earth, of which 419 are hosted by M dwarf stars and 137 are hosted by FGK dwarfs. Approximately 130 of the $R < 2~R_\oplus$ planets will have host stars brighter than K = 9. Approximately 48 of the planets with $R < 2~R_\oplus$ lie within or near the habitable zone ($0.2 < S/S_\oplus < 2$), and between 2-7 such planets have host stars brighter than K = 9. We also expect approximately 1100 detections of planets with radii 2-4 R_Earth, and 67 planets larger than $4~R_\oplus$

Here we detail our version of a reduction pipeline for K2 target pixel data, which automatically: defines masks for all targets in a given frame; extracts the target's flux- and position time series; corrects the time series based on the apparent movement on the CCD (either in 1D or 2D) combined with the correction of instrumental and/or planetary signals via the KASOC filter (Handberg & Lund 2014), thus rendering the time series ready for asteroseismic analysis; computes power spectra for all targets, and identifies potential contaminations between targets. From a test of our pipeline on a sample of targets from the K2 campaign 0, the recovery of data for multiple targets increases the amount of potential light curves by a factor ${\geq}10$. 2014) and PLATO 2.0 (Rauer et al. 2013) missions.

High-precision acoustic helium signatures in 18 low-mass low-luminosity red giants. Analysis from more than four years of Kepler observations (E. Corsaro - 17 April, 2015)
High-precision frequencies of acoustic modes in red giant stars are now available thanks to the long observing length and high-quality of the light curves provided by the NASA Kepler mission, thus allowing to probe the interior of evolved cool low-mass stars with unprecedented level of detail. We characterize the acoustic signature of the helium second ionization zone in a sample of 18 low-mass low-luminosity red giants by exploiting new mode frequency measurements derived from more than four years of Kepler observations. We measure the acoustic depth and the characteristic width of the acoustic glitches with a precision level on average around $\sim$2% and $\sim$8%, respectively. Lastly, we derive the amplitude of the glitch signal at $Î½_\mathrm{max}$ for the second differences and for the frequencies with an average precision of $\sim$6%, obtaining values in the range 0.14-0.24 $Î¼$Hz, and 0.08-0.33 $Î¼$Hz, respectively, which can be used to investigate the helium abundance in the stars.

A total of 29 of these 206 objects were found in the SDSS. The reliability of the NODO data can be seen by the results of the detailed analysis that, in practice, less than 0.3% of the 18,000 spectra were incorrectly identified as peculiar objects, most probably because they are variable stars

Dwarf planet (1) Ceres is the next target of NASA's Dawn mission, which is expected to arrive in March 2015. Ceres has an absorption feature at 3.0 microns due to hydroxyl- and/or water-bearing minerals (e.g. 1981, Rivkin et al. 2003). We found that the band center slightly increases from 3.06 microns at lower phase angles (0.7o and 6o) to 3.07 microns at higher phase angles (11 o and 22o), the band depth decreases by ~20% from lower phase angles to higher phase angles, and the band area decreases by ~25% from lower phase angles to higher phase angles. Our results will have implications for constraining the abundance of OH on the surface of Ceres from VIR spectral data, which will be acquired by Dawn starting spring 2015.

Low False-Positive Rate of Kepler Candidates Estimated From A Combination Of Spitzer And Follow-Up Observations (Jean-Michel DÃ©sert - 11 March, 2015)
(Abridged) NASA's Kepler mission has provided several thousand transiting planet candidates, yet only a small subset have been confirmed as true planets. We select a sub-sample of 51 candidates, spanning wide ranges in stellar, orbital and planetary parameter space, and we observe their transits with Spitzer at 4.5 microns. For most of the candidates (85%), the transit depths measured with Kepler are consistent with the depths measured with Spitzer as expected for planetary objects, while we find that the most discrepant measurements are due to the presence of unresolved stars that dilute the photometry. The measured upper limit on the FPR of our sample is 8.8% at a confidence level of 3 sigma

Pulsar Emission above the Spectral Break - A Stacked Approach (Andrew McCann - 5 March, 2015)
NASA's Fermi space telescope has provided us with a bountiful new population of gamma-ray sources following its discovery of 150 new gamma-ray pulsars. One common feature exhibited by all of these pulsars is the form of their spectral energy distribution, which can be described by a power law followed by a spectral break occurring between $\sim$1 and $\sim$8 GeV. Here we present a new stacked analysis with an average of 4.2 years of data on 115 pulsars published in the 2nd LAT catalog of pulsars. This analysis is sensitive to low-level $\sim$100 GeV emission which cannot be resolved in individual pulsars but can be detected from an ensemble.

Rule-based Cross-matching of Very Large Catalogs in NED (Patrick M. Ogle - 3 March, 2015)
The NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) has deployed a new rule-based cross-matching algorithm called Match Expert (MatchEx), capable of cross-matching very large catalogs (VLCs) with >10 million objects. For our first production run, we cross-matched the GALEX All Sky Survey Catalog (GASC), containing nearly 40 million NUV-detected sources, against a directory of 180 million objects in NED. Candidate matches were identified for each GASC source within a 7.5 arcsecond radius. We estimate a match completeness of 97.6% and a match accuracy of 99.75%. MatchEx is being used to cross-match over 2 billion catalog sources to NED, including the Spitzer Source List, the 2MASS Point-Source Catalog, AllWISE, and SDSS DR 10

A 3D Search for Companions to 12 Nearby M-Dwarfs (Cassy L. Davison - 20 January, 2015)
Our infrared radial velocity precision using CSHELL at NASA's IRTF is $\sim$90 m s$^{-1}$ over timescales from 13 days to 5 years. With our spectroscopic results the mean companion masses that we rule out of existence are 1.5 M$_{JUP}$ or greater in 10 day orbital periods and 7 M$_{JUP}$ or greater in 100 day orbital periods. Our mean astrometric precision using RECONS data from 0.9-m telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory is $\sim$3 milli-arcseconds over baselines ranging from 9 to 13 years. With our astrometric results the mean companion masses that we rule out of existence are greater than 11.5 M$_{JUP}$ with an orbital period of 4 years and greater than 7.5 M$_{JUP}$ with an orbital period of 8 years. Although we do not detect companions around our sub-sample of 12 stars, we demonstrate that our two techniques probe a regime that is commonly missed in other companion searches of late type stars.

Transiting the Sun: The impact of stellar activity on X-ray and ultraviolet transits (J. Llama - 20 January, 2015)
Using resolved images of the Sun from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory spanning 3.5 years of Solar Cycle 24 we simulate transit light curves of a hot Jupiter to investigate the impact of Solar like activity on our ability to reliably recover properties of the planet's atmosphere in soft X-rays (94 Ã), the UV (131-1700 Ã), and the optical (4500 Ã). We find that for stars with similar activity levels to the Sun, the impact of stellar activity results in the derived radius of the planet in soft X-ray/EUV to be underestimated by up-to 25% or overestimated by up-to 50% depending on whether the planet occults active regions. We also find that in up-to 70% of the X-ray light curves the planet transits over bright star spots. In the far ultraviolet (1600 & 1700 Ã), we find the mean recovered value of the planet-to-star radius ratio to be over-estimated by up-to 20%

Can Kozai-Lidov cycles explain Kepler-78b? (Ken Rice - 24 February, 2015)
It was first detected with NASA's \emph{Kepler} spacecraft and then characterised in more detail using radial velocity follow-up observations. Not only is its size very similar to that of the Earth ($1.2 R_\oplus$), it also has a very similar density ($5.6$ g cm$^{-2}$). What makes this planet particularly interesting is that it orbits its host star every $8.5$ hours, giving it an orbital distance of only $0.0089$ au. We find that this process can indeed produce such very-close-in planets within the age of the host star ($\sim 600 - 900$ Myr), but it is more likely to find such ultra-short-period planets around slightly older stars ($> 1$ Gyr)

Precise time-series photometry for the Kepler-2.0 mission (Suzanne Aigrain - 19 December, 2014)
The recently approved NASA K2 mission has the potential to multiply by an order of magnitude the number of short-period transiting planets found by Kepler around bright and low-mass stars, and to revolutionise our understanding of stellar variability in open clusters. We test this method on a week of data collected during an engineering test in January 2014, perform checks to verify that our method does not alter intrinsic variability signals, and compute the precision as a function of magnitude on long-cadence (30-min) and planetary transit (2.5-hour) timescales. In both cases, we reach photometric precisions close to the precision reached during the nominal Kepler mission for stars fainter than 12th magnitude, and between 40 and 80 parts per million for brighter stars. Finally, we perform a basic transit search on the light curves, detecting 2 bona fide transit-like events, 7 detached eclipsing binaries and 13 classical variables.

We investigate the young stellar population in the Vela Molecular Ridge, Cloud-D (VMR-D), a star forming (SF) region observed by both Spitzer/NASA and Herschel/ESA space telescope. Additional photometric data, spanning from the near-IR to the submillimeter, are used to evaluate both bolometric luminosity and temperature for 33 YSOs located in a region of the cloud observed by both Spitzer and Herschel. The luminosity-temperature diagram suggests that some of these sources are representative of Class 0 objects with bolometric temperatures below 70 K and luminosities of the order of the solar luminosity. We find 122 Herschel cores located on the molecular cloud, 30 of which are protostellar and 92 starless. Considering that 10 protostars are found in both Spitzer and Herschel list it follows that in the investigated region we find 53 protostars and that the Spitzer selected protostars account for approximately two-thirds of the total.

Variability of Disk Emission in Pre-Main Sequence and Related Stars. III. Exploring Structural Changes in the Pre-transitional Disk in HD 169142 (Kevin R. Wagner - 30 October, 2014)
We present near-IR and far-UV observations of the pre-transitional (gapped) disk in HD 169142 using NASA's Infrared Telescope Facility and Hubble Space Telescope. The combination of our data along with existing data sets into the broadband spectral energy distribution reveals variability of up to 45% between ~1.5-10 Î¼m over a maximum timescale of 10 years. All observations known to us separate into two distinct states corresponding to a high near-IR state in the pre-2000 epoch and a low state in the post-2000 epoch, indicating activity within the <1 AU region of the disk. Through analysis of the Pa Î² and Br Î³ lines in our data we derive a mass accretion rate in May 2013 of (1.5 - 2.7) x 10^-9 Msun/yr. We present a theoretical modeling analysis of the disk in HD 169142 using Monte-Carlo radiative transfer simulation software to explore the conditions and perhaps signs of planetary formation in our collection of 24 years of observations. We find that shifting the outer edge (r = 0.3 AU) of the inner disk by 0.05 AU toward the star (in simulation of accretion and/or sculpting by forming planets) successfully reproduces the shift in NIR flux. (2013) and at 7 mm by Osorio et al.

We also find that within the energy range of 662 keV to 6.1 MeV, the change in the nonproportionality of the strontium iodide doped with europium is about 1.5 to 2 percent.

MIARMA: An information preserving method for filling gaps in time series. Application to CoRoT light curves (J. Pascual-Granado - 3 October, 2014)
The method MIARMA is particularly suitable for replacing invalid data such as those present in the light curves of the CoRoT satellite due to the pass through the South Atlantic Anomaly, and eventually for the data gathered by the NASA planet hunter Kepler. We select a sample of stars from the ultra-precise photometry collected by the asteroseismic camera on board the CoRoT satellite: the Î´ Scuti star HD 174966, showing periodic variations of the same order as the CoRoT observational window, the Be star HD 51193, showing longer time variations, and the solar-like HD 49933, with rapid time variations. In particular: the power spectrum of HD 174966 is clearly aliased when this interpolation is used for filling the gaps; the light curve of HD 51193 presents a much more aliased spectrum than expected for a low frequency harmonic signal; and finally, although the linear interpolation does not affect noticeably the power spectrum of the CoRoT light curve of the solar-like star HD 49933, the ARMA interpolation showed rapid variations previously unidentified that ARMA interprets as a signal

The ground-based H, K, and L-band absolute emission spectra of HD 209458b (Robert T. Zellem - 29 September, 2014)
Here we explore the capabilities of NASA's 3.0 meter Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) and SpeX spectrometer and the 5.08 meter Hale telescope with the TripleSpec spectrometer with near-infrared H, K, and L-band measurements of HD 209458b's secondary eclipse. Previous measurements of HD 189733b's L-band indicate bright emission hypothesized to result from non-LTE CH$_{4}$ $Î½_{3}$ fluorescence. We do not detect a similar bright 3.3 $Î¼$m feature to ~3$Ï$, suggesting that fluorescence does not need to be invoked to explain HD 209458b's L-band measurements. The validity of our observation and reduction techniques, which decrease the flux variance by up to 2.8 orders of magnitude, is reinforced by 1$Ï$ agreement with existent $Hubble$/NICMOS and $Spitzer$/IRAC1 observations which overlap the H, K, and L-bands, suggesting that both IRTF/SpeX and Palomar/TripleSpec can measure an exoplanet's emission with high precision.

V4046 Sgr: Touchstone to Investigate Spectral Type Discrepancies for Pre-main Sequence Stars (Joel H. Kastner - 24 September, 2014)
To address this problem, we have obtained near-IR spectroscopy of the nearby, close binary T Tauri system V4046 Sgr AB with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility (IRTF) SPEX spectrometer. The V4046 Sgr close binary (and circumbinary disk) system provides an important test case for spectral type determination thanks to the stringent observational constraints on its component stellar masses (i.e., ~0.9 Msun each) as well as on its age (12-21 Myr) and distance (73 pc)

Spectroscopic Study of the Open Cluster NGC 6811 (Joanna Molenda-Zakowicz - 17 September, 2014)
The NASA space telescope Kepler has provided unprecedented time-series observations which have revolutionised the field of asteroseismology, i.e. One of the clusters observed with Kepler is NGC 6811, which is the target of the present paper. We use medium-resolution (R~25,000) spectroscopic observations, and three independent analysis methods, to derive effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, projected rotational velocities and radial velocities, for 15 stars in the field of the open cluster NGC 6811. For those five stars, we provide chemical abundances of 31 elements. The mean radial-velocity of NGC 6811 is found to be +6.68$\pm$0.08 km s$^{-1}$ and the mean metallicity and overall abundance pattern are shown to be very close to solar with an exception of Ba which we find to be overabundant.

On the dichotomy of Seyfert 2 galaxies: intrinsic differences and evolution (E. Koulouridis - 10 November, 2014)
We used the NED (NASA extragalactic database) to find all neighboring galaxies within projected radius of 200 kpc/h around each galaxy, and radial velocity difference delta_u< 500 km/s. We find that, within a projected radius of at least 150 kpc/h around each Seyfert, the fraction of non-HBLR Sy2 galaxies with a close companion is significantly higher than that of their control sample, at the 96% confidence level. Given that the HBLR Seyfert 2 galaxies are essentially Seyfert 1 (Sy1), with their broad line region (BLR) hidden because of the obscuration by the torus, while the non-HBLR Sy2 sample probably also includes intrinsically different objects, like "true" Sy2s that lack the BLR, and heavily obscured objects that prohibit even its indirect detection, our results are discussed within the context of an evolutionary sequence of activity triggered by close galaxy interactions and merging

More chips off of Asteroid (4) Vesta: characterization of eight Vestoids and their HED meteorite analogs (Paul S. Hardersen - 12 August, 2014)
(2010), that were observed at the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility on January 14, 2013 UT. They include (3867) Shiretoko, (5235) Jean-Loup, (5560) Amytis, (6331) 1992 FZ1, (6976) Kanatsu, (17469) 1991 BT, (29796) 1999 CW77, and (30872) 1992 EM17. All eight asteroids exhibit the broad 0.9 and 1.9 micron mineral absorption features indicative of pyroxene on each asteroid's surface. Data reduction and analysis via multiple techniques produced consistent results for the derived spectral absorption band centers and average pyroxene surface chemistries for all eight asteroids (Reddy et al., 2012; Lindsay et al., 2013,2014; Gaffey et al., 2002; Burbine et al., 2009). (3867) Shiretoko is most consistent with the eucrite meteorites while the remaining seven asteroids are most consistent with the howardite meteorites
