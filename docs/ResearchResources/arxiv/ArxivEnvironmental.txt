Unsupervised Feature Learning Based on Deep Models for Environmental Audio Tagging (Yong Xu - 29 November, 2016)
Environmental audio tagging aims to predict only the presence or absence of certain acoustic events in the interested acoustic scene. Compared with the standard Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) baseline of the DCASE 2016 audio tagging challenge, our proposed method obtains a significant equal error rate (EER) reduction from 0.21 to 0.13 on the development set. The proposed aDAE system can get a relative 6.7% EER reduction compared with the strong DNN baseline on the development set. Finally, the results also show that our approach obtains the state-of-the-art performance with 0.15 EER on the evaluation set of the DCASE 2016 audio tagging task while EER of the first prize of this challenge is 0.17.

Extreme Scaling of Supercomputing with Stranded Power: Costs and Capabilities (Fan Yang - 7 July, 2016)
Power consumption (supply, heat, cost) and associated carbon emissions (environmental impact) are increasingly critical challenges in scaling supercomputing to Exascale and beyond. We proposes to exploit stranded power, renewable energy that has no value to the power grid, for scaling supercomputers, Zero-Carbon Cloud (ZCCloud), and showing that stranded power can be employed effectively to expand computing [1]. The ZCCloud approach reduces TCO by 21-45%, and improves cost-effectiveness up to 34%. With higher power price, cheaper computing hardware and higher system power density, benefits rise to 55%, 97% and 116% respectively. Finally, we study future extreme-scale systems, showing that beyond terascale, projected power requirements in excess of 100MW make ZCCloud up to 45% lower cost, for a fixed budget, increase peak PFLOPS achievable by 80%.

Towards Eco-friendly Database Management Systems (Willis Lang - 9 September, 2009)

On MySQL, PVC can reduce energy consumption by 20% with a response time penalty of only 6%.

Societal Implicit Memory and his Speed on Tracking Extrema over Dynamic Environments using Self-Regulatory Swarms (Vitorino Ramos - 30 November, 2005)
In order to overcome difficult dynamic optimization and environment extrema tracking problems, We propose a Self-Regulated Swarm (SRS) algorithm which hybridizes the advantageous characteristics of Swarm Intelligence as the emergence of a societal environmental memory or cognitive map via collective pheromone laying in the landscape (properly balancing the exploration/exploitation nature of our dynamic search strategy), with a simple Evolutionary mechanism that trough a direct reproduction procedure linked to local environmental features is able to self-regulate the above exploratory swarm population, speeding it up globally. One of the most interesting illustrate that the present SRS collective swarm of bio-inspired ant-like agents is able to track about 65% of moving peaks traveling up to ten times faster than the velocity of a single individual composing that precise swarm tracking system.

Moderate Environmental Variation Promotes the Evolution of Robust Solutions (Nicola Milano - 1 March, 2018)
These two types of environmental variations play partially distinct roles as demonstrated by the fact that agents evolved in environments that do not vary throughout generations display lower performance than agents evolved in varying environments independently from the amount of environmental variation experienced during evaluation. This is explained by the fact that the probability to retain genetic variations, including non-neutral variations that alter the behavior of the agents, increases when the environment varies throughout generations but also when new environmental conditions persist over time long enough to enable genetic accommodation.

Context Discovery for Model Learning in Partially Observable Environments (Nikolas J. Hemion - 2 August, 2016)
Unfortunately, learning a model is difficult in partially observable environments, where latent environmental factors influence what the agent observes. In the absence of a supervisory training signal, autonomous agents therefore require a mechanism to autonomously discover these environmental factors, or sensorimotor contexts.

Video Registration in Egocentric Vision under Day and Night Illumination Changes (Stefano Alletto - 28 July, 2016)
The overall registration performance is strictly tied to the actual quality of this 2D-3D matching, and can degrade if environmental conditions such as steep changes in lighting like the ones between day and night occur. The results show that the proposed method can outperform state of the art registration algorithms, in particular when dealing with the challenges of night and day sequences.

Combined Top-Down and Bottom-Up Approaches to Performance-guaranteed Integrated Task and Motion Planning of Cooperative Multi-agent Systems (Rafael Rodrigues da Silva - 15 December, 2016)
It is shown that the proposed framework can handle dynamical environments as the motion primitives possess reactive features, making the motion plans adaptive to local environmental changes

La representaciÃ³n de la variaciÃ³n contextual mediante definiciones terminolÃ³gicas flexibles (Antonio San MartÃ­n - 1 June, 2016)
This consists of a set of definitions of the same concept made up of a general definition (in this case, one encompassing the entire environmental domain) along with additional definitions describing the concept from the perspective of the subdomains in which it is relevant. The main objective of this thesis is to analyze the effects of contextual variation on specialized environmental concepts with a view to their representation in terminological definitions

Dynamic Pose-Robust Facial Expression Recognition by Multi-View Pairwise Conditional Random Forests (Arnaud Dapogny - 21 July, 2016)
Such representation undergoes great variability of the facial morphology and environmental factors as well as head pose variations. Experiments on popular datasets show that our method leads to significant improvements over standard Random Forests as well as state-of-the-art approaches on several scenarios, including a novel multi-view video corpus generated from a publicly available database.

Environmental Information Improves Robotic Search Performance (Harun Yetkin - 22 June, 2018)
We specifically consider applications where environmental information can be acquired either by a separate vehicle or by the same vehicle that performs the search task. Our main contribution in this study is to formally derive a decision-theoretic cost function to compute the locations where the environmental information should be acquired
