A Generative Adversarial Model for Right Ventricle Segmentation (NicolÃ³ Savioli - 27 September, 2018)
The clinical management of several cardiovascular conditions, such as pulmonary hypertension, require the assessment of the right ventricular (RV) function. This work proposes a solution based on Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNN), where our first contribution is the optimal combination of three concepts (the convolution Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), and the L1 loss function) that achieves an improvement of 0.05 and 3.49 mm in Dice Index and Hausdorff Distance respectively with respect to the baseline FCNN. The study is conducted in a large in-house dataset of $\sim$ 23.000 segmented MRI slices, and its generality is verified in a publicly available dataset.

VoxelAtlasGAN: 3D Left Ventricle Segmentation on Echocardiography with Atlas Guided Generation and Voxel-to-voxel Discrimination (Suyu Dong - 10 June, 2018)
It is not only because of that echocardiography is a real-time imaging technology and widespread in clinical application, but also because of that LV segmentation on 3D echocardiography can provide more full volume information of heart than LV segmentation on 2D echocardiography. And cGAN advantageously fuses substantial 3D spatial context information from 3D echocardiography by self-learning structured loss; 2) For the first time, it embeds the atlas into an end-to-end optimization framework, which uses 3D LV atlas as a powerful prior knowledge to improve the inference speed, address the lower contrast and the limited annotation problems of 3D echocardiography; 3) It combines traditional discrimination loss and the new proposed consistent constraint, which further improves the generalization of the proposed framework. VoxelAtlasGAN was validated on 60 subjects on 3D echocardiography and it achieved satisfactory segmentation results and high inference speed. The mean surface distance is 1.85 mm, the mean hausdorff surface distance is 7.26 mm, mean dice is 0.953, the correlation of EF is 0.918, and the mean inference speed is 0.1s

For our initial system, we identified 30 phenomenological traits to be recognized in the CT scans. To test the system, we designed a clinical trial using over 4.8 million CT head images (29,925 studies), completely disjoint from the training and validation set, interpreted by 35 US Board Certified radiologists with specialized CT head experience. DeepRadiologyNet achieved a clinically significant miss rate of 0.0367% on automatically selected high-confidence studies. Thus, DeepRadiologyNet enables significant reduction in the workload of human radiologists by automatically filtering studies and reporting on the high-confidence ones at an operating point well below the literal error rate for US Board Certified radiologists, estimated at 0.82%.

Development and validation of a novel dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) score based on metabolism FDG-PET imaging (Karteek Popuri - 2 November, 2017)
This ensemble model outputs a FDG-PET DAT score (FPDS) between 0 and 1 denoting the probability of a subject to be clinically diagnosed with DAT based on their metabolism profile. A novel 7 group image stratification scheme is devised that groups images not only based on their associated clinical diagnosis but also on past and future trajectories of the clinical diagnoses, yielding a more continuous representation of the different stages of DAT spectrum that mimics a real-world clinical setting. The potential for using FPDS as a DAT biomarker was validated on a large number of FDG-PET images (N=2984) obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database taken across the proposed stratification, and a good classification AUC (area under the curve) of 0.78 was achieved in distinguishing between images belonging to subjects on a DAT trajectory and those images taken from subjects not progressing to a DAT diagnosis. Further, the FPDS biomarker achieved state-of-the-art performance on the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to DAT conversion prediction task with an AUC of 0.81, 0.80, 0.77 for the 2, 3, 5 years to conversion windows respectively.

Full Quantification of Left Ventricle via Deep Multitask Learning Network Respecting Intra- and Inter-Task Relatedness (Wufeng Xue - 14 June, 2017)
Cardiac left ventricle (LV) quantification is among the most clinically important tasks for identification and diagnosis of cardiac diseases, yet still a challenge due to the high variability of cardiac structure and the complexity of temporal dynamics. During the final estimation, both intra- and inter-task relatedness are modeled to enforce improvement of generalization: 1) respecting intra-task relatedness, group lasso is applied to each of the regression tasks for sparse and common feature selection and consistent prediction; 2) respecting inter-task relatedness, three phase-guided constraints are proposed to penalize violation of the temporal behavior of the obtained LV indices. Experiments on MR sequences of 145 subjects show that FullLVNet achieves high accurate prediction with our intra- and inter-task relatedness, leading to MAE of 190mm$^2$, 1.41mm, 2.68mm for average areas, RWT, dimensions and error rate of 10.4\% for the phase classification

Multi-scale Image Fusion Between Pre-operative Clinical CT and X-ray Microtomography of Lung Pathology (Holger R. Roth - 27 February, 2017)
In this work, we use clinical CT to image lung cancer patients before partial pneumonectomy (resection of pathological lung tissue). The resected specimen is prepared for $Î¼$CT imaging at a voxel resolution of 50 $Î¼$m (0.05 mm). dev.) minimum surface distance between $Î¼$CT and clinical CT at the resected lung surface is reduced from 3.3 $\pm$ 2.9 (range: [0.1, 15.9]) to 2.3 mm $\pm$ 2.8 (range: [0.0, 15.3]) mm. The alignment of clinical CT with $Î¼$CT will allow further registration with even finer resolutions of $Î¼$CT (up to 10 $Î¼$m resolution) and ultimately with histopathological microscopy images for further macro to micro image fusion that can aid medical image analysis.

Transfer Learning for Domain Adaptation in MRI: Application in Brain Lesion Segmentation (Mohsen Ghafoorian - 25 February, 2017)
This limits the use of models trained with large annotated legacy datasets on a new dataset with a different domain which is often a recurring situation in clinical settings. In this study, we aim to answer the following central questions regarding domain adaptation in medical image analysis: Given a fitted legacy model, 1) How much data from the new domain is required for a decent adaptation of the original network?; and, 2) What portion of the pre-trained model parameters should be retrained given a certain number of the new domain training samples? To address these questions, we conducted extensive experiments in white matter hyperintensity segmentation task. We then compared the performance of the model to the surrogate scenarios where either the same trained network is used or a new network is trained from scratch on the new dataset.The domain-adapted network tuned only by two training examples achieved a Dice score of 0.63 substantially outperforming a similar network trained on the same set of examples from scratch.

Automatic Liver and Tumor Segmentation of CT and MRI Volumes using Cascaded Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (Patrick Ferdinand Christ - 23 February, 2017)
Automatic segmentation of the liver and hepatic lesions is an important step towards deriving quantitative biomarkers for accurate clinical diagnosis and computer-aided decision support systems. The second FCN solely segments lesions within the predicted liver ROIs of step 1. CFCN models were trained on an abdominal CT dataset comprising 100 hepatic tumor volumes. Validations on further datasets show that CFCN-based semantic liver and lesion segmentation achieves Dice scores over 94% for liver with computation times below 100s per volume. We further experimentally demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method on an 38 MRI liver tumor volumes and the public 3DIRCAD dataset.

A Deep Active Survival Analysis Approach for Precision Treatment Recommendations: Application of Prostate Cancer (Milad Zafar Nezhad - 9 April, 2018)
First, our approach provides better representation with lower dimensions from clinical features using labeled (time-to-event) and unlabeled (censored) instances and then actively trains the survival model by labeling the censored data using an oracle. As a clinical assistive tool, we introduce a simple effective treatment recommendation approach based on our survival model
