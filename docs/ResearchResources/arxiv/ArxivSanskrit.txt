New Vistas to study Bhartrhari: Cognitive NLP (Jayashree Gajjam - 10 October, 2018)
The Sanskrit grammatical tradition which has commenced with Panini's Astadhyayi mostly as a Padasastra has culminated as a Vakyasastra, at the hands of Bhartrhari. The grammarian-philosopher Bhartrhari and his authoritative work 'Vakyapadiya' have been a matter of study for modern scholars, at least for more than 50 years, since Ashok Aklujkar submitted his Ph.D

Upcycle Your OCR: Reusing OCRs for Post-OCR Text Correction in Romanised Sanskrit (Amrith Krishna - 6 September, 2018)
Currently, there exists no dataset available for Romanised Sanskrit OCR. So, we bootstrap a dataset of 430 images, scanned in two different settings and their corresponding ground truth. We find that the use of copying mechanism (Gu et al., 2016) yields a percentage increase of 7.69 in Character Recognition Rate (CRR) than the current state of the art model in solving monotone sequence-to-sequence tasks (Schnober et al., 2016). We find that our system is robust in combating OCR-prone errors, as it obtains a CRR of 87.01% from an OCR output with CRR of 35.76% for one of the dataset settings

Free as in Free Word Order: An Energy Based Model for Word Segmentation and Morphological Tagging in Sanskrit (Amrith Krishna - 5 September, 2018)
We propose a structured prediction framework that jointly solves the word segmentation and morphological tagging tasks in Sanskrit. Our model outperforms the state of the art with an F-Score of 96.92 (percentage improvement of 7.06%) while using less than one-tenth of the task-specific training data. We find that the use of a graph based ap- proach instead of a traditional lattice-based sequential labelling approach leads to a percentage gain of 12.6% in F-Score for the segmentation task.

Building a Word Segmenter for Sanskrit Overnight (Vikas Reddy - 16 February, 2018)

Computational Model to Generate Case-Inflected Forms of Masculine Nouns for Word Search in Sanskrit E-Text (S V Kasmir Raja - 17 December, 2014)
The case-inflectional forms of a noun normally number 24 owing to the fact that in Sanskrit there are eight cases and three numbers-singular, dual and plural. Further, it would be a cumbersome exercise to generate and search for 24 forms of a word during a word search in a large text, using the currently available case-inflectional form generators. Further, an optimized model that is sufficient for generating only those word forms that are required in a word search and is more than 80% efficient compared to the complete case-inflectional forms generator, is presented in this study for the first time.

Comets in ancient India (Patrick Das Gupta - 30 November, 2014)
In Rigveda ($\sim $ 1700 - 1500 BC) and Atharvaveda ($\sim $ 1150 BC), there are references to dhumaketus and ketus, which stand for comets in Sanskrit. Rigveda mentions a fig tree with roots held up in the sky (Parpola 2009, 2010). Could it have been inspired by the hirsute appearance of a comet's tail? Similarly, could `Ketu' (the torso or the tail part of Rahu) be a Dravidian loan word, since `kottu', an old Tamil word, is associated with scorpion's sting and top tuft of hair? Varahamihira in 550 AD and Ballal Sena ($\sim $ 1100 - 1200 AD) have described a large number of comets recorded by ancient seers such as Parashara, Vriddha Garga, Narada, Garga, etc

An Ontology for Comprehensive Tutoring of Euphonic Conjunctions of Sanskrit Grammar (S. V. Kasmir Raja - 3 February, 2015)
This work presents a comprehensive ontology designed to enable a student-user to learn in stages all about euphonic conjunctions and the relevant aphorisms of Sanskrit grammar and to test and evaluate the progress of the student-user. The ontology forms the basis of a multimedia sandhi tutor that was given to different categories of users including Sanskrit scholars for extensive and rigorous testing.

Computational Algorithms Based on the Paninian System to Process Euphonic Conjunctions for Word Searches (S. V. Kasmir Raja - 15 September, 2014)
Further, there is no search engine in the literature that can comprehensively search for words in Sanskrit E-texts taking euphonic conjunctions into account. This work presents an optimal binary representational schema for letters of the Sanskrit alphabet along with algorithms to efficiently process the sandhi rules of Sanskrit grammar

A Binary Schema and Computational Algorithms to Process Vowel-based Euphonic Conjunctions for Word Searches (S. V. Kasmir Raja - 15 September, 2014)
Comprehensively searching for words in Sanskrit E-text is a non-trivial problem because words could change their forms in different contexts. The change wrought by these possible conjunctions can be so significant in Sanskrit that a simple search for the word in its given form alone can significantly reduce the success level of the search

Design and Construction of a Brain-Like Computer: A New Class of Frequency-Fractal Computing Using Wireless Communication in a Supramolecular Organic, Inorganic System (Subrata Ghosh - 28 January, 2014)
The electromagnetic resonance band of each seed looks similar, but the seeds of any layer shares a common region in its resonance band with inner and upper layer, hence a chain of resonance bands is formed (frequency fractal) connecting the smallest to the largest seed (hence the name invincible rhythm or Ajeya Chhandam in Sanskrit).
