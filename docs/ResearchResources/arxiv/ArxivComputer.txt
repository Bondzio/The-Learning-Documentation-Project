Learning Depth with Convolutional Spatial Propagation Network (Xinjing Cheng - 4 October, 2018)
Depth prediction is one of the fundamental problems in computer vision. In practice, we further extend CSPN in two aspects: 1) take sparse depth map as additional input, which is useful for the task of depth completion; 2) similar to commonly used 3D convolution operation in CNNs, we propose 3D CSPN to handle features with one additional dimension, which is effective in the task of stereo matching using 3D cost volume. We experimented the proposed CPSN conjunct algorithms over the popular NYU v2 and KITTI datasets, where we show that our proposed algorithms not only produce high quality (e.g., 30% more reduction in depth error), but also run faster (e.g., 2 to 5x faster) than previous SOTA spatial propagation network. We also evaluated our stereo matching algorithm on the Scene Flow and KITTI Stereo datasets, and rank 1st on both the KITTI Stereo 2012 and 2015 benchmarks, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed module

Recently, an optical machine learning method based on diffractive deep neural networks (D2NNs) has been introduced to execute a function as the input light diffracts through passive layers, designed by deep learning using a computer. Using five phase-only diffractive layers, we numerically achieved a classification accuracy of 97.18% and 87.67% for optical recognition of handwritten digits and fashion products, respectively; using both phase and amplitude modulation (complex-valued) at each layer, our inference performance improved to 97.81% and 88.76%, respectively. Using a 5-layer phase-only D2NN jointly-optimized with a single fully-connected electronic layer, we achieved a classification accuracy of 98.17% and 89.90% for the recognition of handwritten digits and fashion products, respectively. Moreover, the input to the electronic network was compressed by >7.8 times down to 10x10 pixels, making the jointly-optimized hybrid system perform classification with a simple electronic layer

Synthetic Sampling for Multi-Class Malignancy Prediction (Matthew Yung - 6 July, 2018)
We explore several oversampling techniques for an imbalanced multi-label classification problem, a setting often encountered when developing models for Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CADx) systems. Using low-level image features and a random forest classifier, we show that using synthetic oversampling techniques increases the sensitivity of the minority classes by an average of 7.22% points, with as much as a 19.88% point increase in sensitivity for a particular minority class

A Survey of Knowledge Representation and Retrieval for Learning in Service Robotics (David Paulius - 5 July, 2018)
The task of robot learning is very broad, as it involves many tasks such as object detection, action recognition, motion planning, localization, knowledge representation and retrieval, and the intertwining of computer vision and machine learning techniques. Specifically, we look at three broad categories involved in task representation and retrieval for robotics: 1) activity recognition from demonstrations, 2) scene understanding and interpretation, and 3) task representation in robotics - datasets and networks

Simulation Study on Collaborative Content Distribution in Delay Tolerant Vehicular Networks (Rusheng Zhang - 3 July, 2018)
Modern vehicles are equipped with more and more sophisticated computer modules, which need to periodically download files from the cloud, such as security certificates, digital maps, system firmwares, etc. Our simulation results show that, with only 1\% of vehicles enabled with cellular communication, it takes less than 24 hours to distribute a file to 90\% of the vehicles in a metropolitan area, and around 48 to 72 hours to distribute to 99\%

Quantum Random Self-Modifiable Computation (Michael Stephen Fiske - 21 September, 2018)
Among the fundamental questions in computer science, at least two have a deep impact on mathematics. In 1936, Alan Turing posed the halting problem for Turing machines and proved that this problem is unsolvable for Turing machines. --> X_m, so at the mth stage ex-machine X_m can correctly determine for 0 <= i <= m whether M_i's execution on tape T_i eventually halts? We demonstrate an ex-machine Q(x) that has one such evolutionary path. The existence of this evolutionary path suggests that David Hilbert was not misguided to propose in 1900 that mathematicians search for finite processes to help construct mathematical proofs

Topic Discovery in Massive Text Corpora Based on Min-Hashing (Gibran Fuentes-Pineda - 2 July, 2018)
This paper describes an alternative approach to discover topics based on Min-Hashing, which can handle massive text corpora and large vocabularies using modest computer hardware and does not require to fix the number of topics in advance. An extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluation using the 20 Newsgroups (18K), Reuters (800K), Spanish Wikipedia (1M), and English Wikipedia (5M) corpora shows that the proposed approach is able to consistently discover meaningful and coherent topics. Remarkably, the time complexity of the proposed approach is linear with respect to corpus and vocabulary size; a non-parallel implementation was able to discover topics from the entire English edition of Wikipedia with over 5 million documents and 1 million words in less than 7 hours.

Transparent, Efficient, and Robust Word Embedding Access with WOMBAT (Mark-Christoph MÃ¼ller - 2 July, 2018)
Code that uses WOMBAT for accessing word embeddings is not only cleaner, more readable, and easier to reuse, but also much more efficient than code using standard in-memory methods: a Python script using WOMBAT for evaluating seven large word embedding collections (8.7M embedding vectors in total) on a simple SemEval sentence similarity task involving 250 raw sentence pairs completes in under ten seconds end-to-end on a standard notebook computer.

A Pulmonary Nodule Detection Model Based on Progressive Resolution and Hierarchical Saliency (Junjie Zhang - 2 July, 2018)
Although a number of computer-aided nodule detection methods have been published in the literature, these methods still have two major drawbacks: missing out true nodules during the detection of nodule candidates and less-accurate identification of nodules from non-nodule. We evaluated our algorithm on the benchmark LUng Nodule Analysis 2016 (LUNA16) dataset and achieved a state-of-the-art detection score
