Solar Physics with the Square Kilometre Array (A. Nindos - 11 October, 2018)
The SKA will have two independent instruments, SKA-LOW comprising of dipoles organized as aperture arrays in Australia and SKA-MID comprising of dishes in South Africa. Currently the phase-1 of SKA, referred to as SKA1, is in its late design stage and construction is expected to start in 2020. Both SKA1-LOW (frequency range of 50-350 MHz) and SKA1-MID Bands 1, 2, and 5 (frequency ranges of 350-1050, 950-1760, and 4600-15300 MHz, respectively) are important for solar observations

Disability for HIV and Disincentives for Health: The Impact of South Africa's Disability Grant on HIV/AIDS Recovery (Noah Haber - 3 October, 2018)
South Africa's disability grants program is tied to its HIV/AIDS recovery program, such that individuals who are ill enough may qualify. Qualification is historically tied to a CD4 count of 200 cells/mm3, which improve when a person adheres to antiretroviral therapy. We find that disability grant threshold rules caused recipients to have a relatively slower CD4 recovery rate of about 20-30 cells/mm3/year, or a 20% reduction in the speed of recovery around the threshold.

Mitigating the Effects of Antenna-to-Antenna Variation on Redundant-Baseline Calibration for 21 cm Cosmology (Naomi Orosz - 25 September, 2018)
This strategy is being employed by the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA), a large radio telescope in South Africa that is now observing while being built out to 350 14-m dishes. Using simulations of HERA, we show how calibration with antenna-to-antenna variations in dish construction and placement generally lead to spectral structure in otherwise smooth foregrounds that significantly reduces the number of cosmological modes available to a 21 cm measurement

SKA-Athena Synergy White Paper (R. Cassano - 24 July, 2018)
The Square Kilometer Array (SKA) is the next generation radio observatory and consists of two telescopes, one comprised of dishes operating at mid frequencies (SKA1-MID) and located in South Africa, and the other comprised of Log-Periodic antennas operating at low radio frequencies (SKA1-LOW), which will be located in Australia (Braun et al. 2017). The astrophysical community was involved in this exercise primarily through a dedicated SKA-Athena Synergy Workshop, which took place on April 24-25, 2017 at SKAO, Jodrell Bank, Manchester. The final result of the synergy exercise, this White Paper, describes in detail a number of scientific opportunities that will be opened up by the combination of Athena and SKA, these include: 1. the Cosmic Dawn; 2. the Evolution of black holes and galaxies; 3. Active galaxy feedback in galaxy clusters; 4. Non-thermal phenomena in galaxy clusters; 5. Detecting the cosmic web; 6. Black-hole accretion physics and astrophysical transients; 7

Automatic Speech Recognition for Humanitarian Applications in Somali (Raghav Menon - 23 July, 2018)
The system is part of an ongoing effort by the United Nations (UN) to implement keyword spotting systems supporting humanitarian relief programmes in parts of Africa where languages are severely under-resourced. We find that both types of data augmentation are beneficial to performance, with our best system using a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), time-delay neural networks (TDNNs) and bi-directional long short term memory (BLSTMs) to achieve a word error rate of 53.75%.

ASR-free CNN-DTW keyword spotting using multilingual bottleneck features for almost zero-resource languages (Raghav Menon - 23 July, 2018)
This forms part of a United Nations effort using keyword spotting to support humanitarian relief programmes in parts of Africa where languages are severely under-resourced. We use 1920 isolated keywords (40 types, 34 minutes) as exemplars for dynamic time warping (DTW) template matching, which is performed on a much larger body of untranscribed speech. We show that multilingual BNFs trained on ten languages improve the area under the ROC curve of a CNN-DTW system by 10.9% absolute relative to the MFCC baseline

Fast ASR-free and almost zero-resource keyword spotting using DTW and CNNs for humanitarian monitoring (Raghav Menon - 25 June, 2018)
The aim is to allow rapid deployment of a keyword spotting system in a new language to support urgent United Nations (UN) relief programmes in parts of Africa where languages are extremely under-resourced and the development of annotated speech resources is infeasible. First, we use 1920 recorded keywords (40 keyword types, 34 minutes of speech) as exemplars in a DTW-based template matching system and apply it to untranscribed broadcast speech. In this way we use just 34 minutes of labelled speech, but leverage a large amount of unlabelled data for training. While the resulting CNN keyword spotter cannot match the performance of the DTW-based system, it substantially outperforms a CNN classifier trained only on the keywords, improving the area under the ROC curve from 0.54 to 0.64

Multi-Technique Analysis of Precipitable Water Vapor Estimates in the sub-Sahel West Africa (Oluwasesan A. Falaiye - 22 September, 2018)
Several Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) sites have been established across West Africa, and observations from four of them, namely, Ilorin (4.34o E, 8.32o N), Cinzana (5.93o W, 13.28o N), Banizoumbou (2.67o E, 13.54o N) and Dakar (16.96o W, 14.39o N) are being used in this study. Data spanning the period from 2004 to 2014 have been selected, they include conventional humidity parameters, remotely sensed aerosol and precipitable water information and numerical model outputs. Moreover, we have also used the AERONET information to evaluate the capabilities of well-established numerical weather prediction (NWP) models such as ERA Interim Reanalysis, NCEP-DOE Reanalysis II and NCEP-CFSR, to estimate precipitable water vapor in the sub-Sahel West Africa, it was found that the models tend to overestimate the amount of precipitable water at the selected sites by about 25 %.

Taxonomy and Light-Curve Data of 1000 Serendipitously Observed Main-Belt Asteroids (N. Erasmus - 10 May, 2018)
We present VRI spectrophotometry of 1003 Main-Belt Asteroids (MBAs) observed with the Sutherland, South Africa, node of the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet). 2017). Our broadband spectrophotometry is reliable enough to distinguish among four asteroid taxonomies and we confidently categorize 836 of the 1003 observed targets as either a S-, C-, X-, or D-type asteroid by means of a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm approach. Our data show that the ratio between S-type MBAs and (C+X+D)-type MBAs, with H magnitudes between 12 and 18 (12 km $\gtrsim$ diameter $\gtrsim$ 0.75 km), is almost exactly 1:1. Additionally, we report 0.5- to 3-hour (median: 1.3-hour) light-curve data for each MBA and we resolve the complete rotation periods and amplitudes for 59 targets. Two out of the 59 targets have rotation periods potentially below the theoretical zero cohesion boundary limit of 2.2 hours

A total of 20.9 million SNP and 3.1 million indels were observed in Qatar, including an average of 1.79% novel variants per individual ge-nome. Replacement of the GRCh37 standard reference with QTRG in a best practices genome analysis workflow resulted in an average of 7* deeper coverage depth (an improvement of 23%), and 756,671 fewer variants on average, a reduction of 16% that is attributed to common Qatari alleles being present in the QTRG reference

Characterization of Near-Earth Asteroids using KMTNet-SAAO (N. Erasmus - 11 September, 2017)
We present here VRI spectrophotometry of 39 near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) observed with the Sutherland, South Africa, node of the Korea Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet). Of the 39 NEAs, 19 were targeted, but because of KMTNet's large 2 deg by 2 deg field of view, 20 serendipitous NEAs were also captured in the observing fields. Targeted observations were performed within 44 days (median: 16 days, min: 4 days) of each NEA's discovery date. Our broadband spectrophotometry is reliable enough to distinguish among four asteroid taxonomies and we were able to confidently categorize 31 of the 39 observed targets as either a S-, C-, X- or D-type asteroid by means of a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm approach. Our data suggest that the ratio between "stony" S-type NEAs and "not-stony" (C+X+D)-type NEAs, with H magnitudes between 15 and 25, is roughly 1:1. Additionally, we report ~1-hour light curve data for each NEA and of the 39 targets we were able to resolve the complete rotation period and amplitude for six targets and report lower limits for the remaining targets.

Northwest Africa 5958: a weakly altered CM-related ungrouped chondrite, not a CI3 (Emmanuel Jacquet - 20 February, 2017)
Northwest Africa (NWA) 5958 is a carbonaceous chondrite found in Morocco in 2009. The petrography and chemistry of NWA 5958 is most similar to a CM chondrite, with a low degree of aqueous alteration, apparently under oxidizing conditions, and evidence of a second, limited alteration episode manifested by alteration fronts. The oxygen isotopic composition, with $Î^{17}$O = -4.3 $\permil$, is more 16O-rich than all CM chondrites, indicating, along with other compositional arguments, a separate parent body of origin. We suggest that NWA 5958 be reclassified as an ungrouped carbonaceous chondrite related to the CM group.

The Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array Dish III: Measuring Chromaticity of Prototype Element with Reflectometry (Nipanjana Patra - 14 March, 2017)
We examine the performance of a prototype of the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA) array element that is currently observing in Karoo desert, South Africa. Combined with the HERA data analysis pipeline that incorporates inverse covariance weighting in optimal quadratic estimation of power spectrum, we find that in spite of its departure from the simulated response, HERA prototype element satisfies the necessary criteria posed by the foreground attenuation limits and potentially can measure the power spectrum at spatial modes as low as $k_{\parallel} > 0.1h$~Mpc$^{-1}$. The work highlights a straightforward method for directly measuring an instrument response and assessing its impact on 21 cm EoR power spectrum measurements for future experiments that will use reflector-type antenna.

First observation of a reactor-status effect on the beta+ decay rate of 22Na (Robert de Meijer - 5 July, 2017)
3 kBq 22Na and 60Co sources were conducted at unit #1 (2.775 GW_th) of the Koeberg Nuclear Power Station in South Africa. The setup was shielded from the reactor core by 8 m of uninterrupted concrete. 1% of the total countrate with either source, increased by merely 3% when the reactor status changed from OFF to ON. With the 22Na source, the fractional countrate changes in the step from reactor OFF to ON were: (delA/A)_TOT = [-3.02 +- 0.14(stat) +- 0.07(syst)] x 10^-4, (delA/A)_MED = [+1.44 +- 0.42(stat) +- 0.07(syst)] x 10^-4, and (delA/A)_HI = [-2.70 +- 0.26(stat) +- 0.04(syst)] x 10^-4. The corresponding cross sections are [1.55 +- 0.07(stat)] x 10^-25 cm^2 for EC + beta+ decay in 22Na and [0.5 +- 1.5(stat)] x 10^-26 cm^2 for beta- decay of 60Co

Evidence for a postreproductive phase in female false killer whales Pseudorca crassidens (Theoni Photopoulou - 10 February, 2017)
We examined specimens from false killer whales from combined strandings (South Africa, 1981) and harvest (Japan 1979-80) and found morphological evidence of changes in the activity of the ovaries in relation to age. Ovulation had ceased in 50% of whales over 45 years, and all whales over 55 years old had ovaries classified as postreproductive. PrR for the combined sample was 0.14, whereas the mean of the simulated distribution for PrR under the null hypothesis of no PRLS was 0.02. The 99th percentile of the simulated distribution was 0.08 and no simulated value exceeded 0.13. Our estimates for PrR in false killer whales (0.12-0.37) spanned the single values available for the short-finned pilot whale (0.28) and the killer whale (0.22) and are comparable to estimates for historical or hunter-gather human populations (0.3-0.47).

The 2014 Ebola outbreak in west Africa raised many questions about the control of infectious disease in an increasingly connected global society.

Simulations with a 50% compliance rate are consistent with the case counts in Liberia during the period of rapid decline after mid September, 2014. We also find the travel restriction to be effective at reducing the risks associated with compliance substantially below the 40% level, shortening the outbreak and enabling efforts to be focused on affected areas

Predicting the extinction of Ebola spreading in Liberia due to mitigation strategies (L. D. Valdez - 20 July, 2015)
The Ebola virus is spreading throughout West Africa and is causing thousands of deaths. We study the effect of a strategy in which safe burials are increased and effective hospitalisation instituted under two scenarios: (i) one implemented in mid-July 2014 and (ii) one in mid-August---which was the actual time that strong interventions began in Liberia. We find that if scenario (i) had been pursued the lifetime of the epidemic would have been three months shorter and the total number of infected individuals 80\% less than in scenario (ii). Our projection under scenario (ii) is that the spreading will stop by mid-spring 2015.

The Western Africa Ebola virus disease epidemic exhibits both global exponential and local polynomial growth rates (Gerardo Chowell - 27 January, 2015)
Background: While many infectious disease epidemics are initially characterized by an exponential growth in time, we show that district-level Ebola virus disease (EVD) outbreaks in West Africa follow slower polynomial-based growth kinetics over several generations of the disease. Methods: We analyzed epidemic growth patterns at three different spatial scales (regional, national, and subnational) of the Ebola virus disease epidemic in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia by compiling publicly available weekly time series of reported EVD case numbers from the patient database available from the World Health Organization website for the period 05-Jan to 17-Dec 2014. In contrast, local epidemics are asynchronous and exhibit slow growth patterns during 3 or more EVD generations, which can be better approximated by a polynomial than an exponential

Adapting a previously validated mathematical model of Ebola in West Africa, we examine the potential impact of an increase in hospital capacity to mitigate the impact of Ebola under several scenarios, ranging from the planned scenario of 1700 beds in 10 weeks to a considerably more aggressive approach of twice the number of beds in 5 weeks

Elimination of HIV in South Africa through expanded access to antiretroviral therapy: Cautions, caveats and the importance of parsimony (Brian Williams - 26 March, 2014)
In a recent article Hontelez and colleagues investigate the prospects for elimination of HIV in South Africa through expanded access to antiretroviral therapy (ART) using STDSIM, a micro-simulation model. In contrast to our earlier conclusions Hontelez and colleagues conclude that universal voluntary counselling and testing with immediate ART at 90% coverage should result in the elimination of HIV but would take three times longer than predicted by the model developed by the present author. suggest that the current scale-up of ART at CD4 cell counts less than 350 cells/microL will lead to elimination of HIV in 30 years

Ending AIDS in Gabon: How long will it take? How much will it cost? (Brian Williams - 26 March, 2014)
The prevalence of HIV in West Africa is lower than elsewhere in Africa but Gabon has one of the highest rates of HIV in that region. The availability of ART has reduced the prevalence of HIV among adults not on ART from 4.2% to 2.9%, annual incidence from 0.43% to 0.27%, and the proportion of adults dying from AIDS illnesses each year from 0.36% to 0.13% saving the lives of 2.3 thousand people in 2013 alone. The provision of ART has been highly cost effective saving the country at least $18 million up to 2013.

Genome-wide scan of 29,141 African Americans finds no evidence of selection since admixture (Gaurav Bhatia - 10 December, 2013)
These results stand in contrast to the findings of a recent study of selection in African Americans. That study, which had 15 times fewer samples, reported six loci with significant deviations. The same study reported 14 loci that showed greater population differentiation between African Americans and Nigerian Yoruba than would be expected in the absence of natural selection. Four such loci were previously shown to be genome-wide significant and likely to be affected by selection, but we show that most of the 10 additional loci are likely to be false positives

Ending AIDS in South Africa: How long will it take? How much will it cost? (Brian G. Williams - 7 November, 2013)
South Africa has more people infected with HIV but, by providing access to anti-retroviral therapy (ART), has kept more people alive than any other country. In 2013 the provision of ART has reduced the prevalence of HIV from an estimated 15% to 9% among adults not on ART, the annual incidence from 2% to 0.9%, and the AIDS related deaths from 0.9% to 0.3% p.a. saving 1.5 million lives and USD727M. Regular testing and universal access to ART could reduce the prevalence among adults not on ART in 2023 to 0.06%, annual incidence to 0.05%, and eliminate AIDS deaths. Cumulative costs between 2013 ands 2023 would increase by USD692M only 4% of the total cost of USD17Bn. If a universal testing and early treatment had started in 1998 the prevalence of HIV among adults not on ART in 2013 would have fallen to 0.03%, annual incidence to 0.03%, and saved 2.5 million lives. The cost up to 2013 would have increased by USD18Bn but this would have been cost effective at US$7,200 per life saved

A MASS-DIMM (MultiAperture Scintillation Sensor - Differential Image Motion Monitor) was commissioned in March 2010 to provide continuous monitoring of the seeing conditions. After the first year of data collection, the overall median seeing value is found to be 1.32" as measured at ground level. The ground layer which includes all layers below 1 km accounts for 84% of the turbulence, while the free atmosphere above 1 km accounts for 16% with a median value of 0.41". The median isoplanatic angle value is 1.92", which is similar to other major astronomical sites. The median coherence time, calculated from corrected MASS measurements, is 2.85 ms

Our analysis allows us -- for the first time -- to formally reject a history of ancestral population structure and instead reveals strong support for admixture from Neandertals into Eurasian populations at a higher rate (3.4%-7.9%) than suggested previously.

R0 and the elimination of HIV in Africa: Will 90-90-90 be sufficient? (Brian G. Williams - 14 July, 2014)
We show that in sub-Saharan Africa the median value of R0 is 4.6 and in all but five countries R0 is less than 6.3. If the 90-90-90 target is reached, 73% of all those living with HIV will have full viral load suppression. If this is maintained it should guarantee elimination in 70% of all countries in sub-Saharan Africa and will reduce R0 to less than 2 in the remaining 12 countries, making elimination easy to achieve by increasing the availability of other high impact methods of prevention.

Dense optical and near-infrared monitoring of CTA 102 during high state in 2012 with OISTER: Detection of intra-night "orphan polarized flux flare" (Ryosuke Itoh - 8 April, 2013)
Following Fermi-LAT detection of enhanced gamma-ray activity, we densely monitored this source in the optical and near-infrared bands for the subsequent ten nights using twelve telescopes in Japan and South-Africa. On MJD 56197 (2012 September 27, 4-5 days after the peak of bright gamma-ray flare), polarized flux showed a transient increase, while total flux and polarization angle remained almost constant during the "orphan polarized-flux flare". We also detected an intra-night and prominent flare on MJD 56202. Emergence of a new emission component with high polarization degree (PD) up to 40% would be responsible for the observed two flares, and such a high PD indicates a presence of highly ordered magnetic field at the emission site

Kinematics of the South Atlantic rift (Christian Heine - 16 June, 2013)
We model an initial E-W directed extension between South America and Africa (fixed in present-day position) at very low extensional velocities until Upper Hauterivian times ($\approx$126 Ma) when rift activity along in the equatorial Atlantic domain started to increase significantly. During this initial $\approx$17 Myr-long stretching episode the Pre-salt basin width on the conjugate Brazilian and West African margins is generated. An intermediate stage between 126.57 Ma and Base Aptian is characterised by strain localisation, rapid lithospheric weakening in the equatorial Atlantic domain, resulting in both progressively increasing extensional velocities as well as a significant rotation of the extension direction to NE-SW. Final breakup between South America and Africa occurred in the conjugate Santos--Benguela margin segment at around 113 Ma and in the Equatorial Atlantic domain between the Ghanaian Ridge and the PiauÃ­-CearÃ¡ margin at 103 Ma

In 2005 there was an outbreak of XDR (extensively drug resistant) TB in Tugela Ferry, which is served by the Church of Scotland Hospital (COSH), in the uMzinyathi District, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. TB incidence and treatment success rates, for each of the 11 districts in the province, were obtained from the provincial electronic TB register for the years 2002-2007.

Biological and Statistical Heterogeneity in Malaria Transmission (Brian G. Williams - 2 January, 2014)
In a study of the heterogeneity in malaria infection rates among children Smith et al.1 fitted several mathematical models to data from community studies in Africa. They concluded that 20% of children receive 80% of infections, that infections last about six months on average, that children who clear infections are not immune to new infections, and that the sensitivity and specificity of microscopy for the detection of malaria parasites are 95.8% and 88.4%, respectively

New 145-MHz Source Measurements by PAPER in the Southern Sky (Daniel C. Jacobs - 6 May, 2011)
We present observations from the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) in South Africa, observed in May and September 2010. Using two nights of drift scanning with PAPER's 60\arcdeg\ FWHM beam we have made a map covering the entire sky below +10 degrees declination with an effective center frequency of 145 MHz, a 70-MHz bandwidth, and a resolution of 26\arcmin. A 4800 square-degree region of this large map with the lowest Galactic emission reaches an RMS of 0.7 Jy. Using the 408-MHz Molonglo Reference Catalog (MRC) as a finding survey, we identify counterparts to 480 sources in our maps, and compare our fluxes to the MRC and to 332 sources in the Culgoora catalog. For both catalogs, the ratio of PAPER to catalog flux averages to 1, with a standard deviation of 50%

Dual-frequency VLBI study of Centaurus A on sub-parsec scales (Cornelia MÃ¼ller - 5 April, 2011)
As a target of the Southern Hemisphere VLBI monitoring program TANAMI (Tracking Active Galactic Nuclei with Milliarcsecond Interferometry), VLBI observations of Cen A are made regularly at 8.4 and 22.3 GHz with the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) and associated telescopes in Antarctica, Chile, and South Africa. An angular resolution of 0.4 mas x 0.7 mas is achieved at 8.4 GHz, corresponding to a linear scale of less than 0.013 pc. By combining with the 22.3 GHz image, which has been taken without contributing transoceanic baselines at somewhat lower resolution, we present the corresponding dual-frequency spectral index distribution along the sub-parsec scale jet revealing the putative emission regions for recently detected gamma-rays from the core region by Fermi/LAT

Raman spectra database of the glass beads excavated on mapungubwe hill and k2, two archaeological sites in South Africa (AurÃ©lie TourniÃ© - 7 December, 2010)
About two hundred coloured glass beads (red, yellow, green, blue, white, black, pink, plum) were selected among the thousands of beads excavated on Mapungubwe hill and at K2, archaeological sites in the Limpopo valley South Africa, and have been studied with Raman scattering. The glass matrix of the beads was classified according to its Raman signature into 3 main sub-groups and corroded glass could also be identified. This calls for further research to find a way to reconcile the carbon dating of the hill, which currently gives the last occupation date on the hill as 1280 AD with the physical evidence of the modern beads excavated on the hill.

The Cape Floristic Region (CFR) in South Africa is a global hot spot of diversity and endemism, and provides a rich class of species abundance data for such modeling. Our model is specified at areal level, where the CFR is divided into roughly $37{,}000$ one minute grid cells; species abundance is observed at some locations within some cells. An important point in this analysis is that only $28%$ of the grid cells have been sampled and that, for sampled grid cells, the number of sampled locations ranges from one to more than one hundred

HR 7355 - another rapidly braking He-strong CP star? (Z. Mikulasek - 23 February, 2010)
Over two years, we acquired 114 new BV observations of HR 7355 at observatories in Arizona, U.S.A and Cape Town, South Africa. We performed period analyses of the new observations along with new analyses of 732 archival measurements from the Hipparcos and ASAS projects. We find that the light curves of HR 7355 in various filters are quite similar, with amplitudes 0.035(4), 0.036(4), and 0.038(3) mag in B, Hp and V, respectively. We substantially refine the rotational period to be P=0.5214410(4) d, indicating that HR 7355 is the most rapidly rotating CP star known. Our period analyses reveal a possible lengthening of the rotational period with dP/dt/P = 2.4(8)x 10^-6/yr. We conclude that the shape and amplitude of HR 7355 light curves are typical of magnetic He-strong CP stars, for which light variations are the result of photospheric spots on the surface of a rotating star

Does heterosexual transmission drive the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Sub-Saharan Africa (or elsewhere)? (Marc Artzrouni - 4 July, 2007)
A two-sex Basic Reproduction Number (BRN) is used to investigate the conditions under which the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) may spread through heterosexual contacts in Sub-Saharan Africa. (The BRN is the expected number of new infections generated by one infected individual; the disease spreads if the BRN is larger than 1). Baseline results show that in the population at large (characterized by equal numbers of men and women) the BRN is larger than 1 if every year each person has 82 sexual contacts with different partners. the BRN is also larger than 1 for commercial sex workers (CSWs) and their clients (two populations of different sizes) if each CSW has about 256 clients per year and each client visits one CSW every two weeks

A case study of speculative financial bubbles in the South African stock market 2003-2006 (Wei-Xing Zhou - 3 October, 2008)
We tested 45 indices and common stocks traded in the South African stock market for the possible existence of a bubble over the period from Jan. 2003 to May 2006. The log-periodic properties are investigated in detail using the first-order log-periodic power-law (LPPL) formula, the parametric detrending method, the $(H,q)$-analysis, and the second-order Weierstrass-type model, resulting in a consistent and robust estimation of the fundamental angular log-frequency $Ï_1 =7\pm 2$, in reasonable agreement with previous estimations on many other bubbles in developed and developing markets. With the insight of 6 additional month of data since the analysis was performed, we observe that many of the stocks on the South Africa market experienced an abrupt drop mid-June 2006, which is compatible with the predicted $t_c$ for several of the stocks, but not all. This suggests that the mini-crash that occurred around mid-June of 2006 was only a partial correction, which has resumed into a renewed bubbly acceleration bound to end some times in 2007, similarly to what happened on the S&P500 US market from Oct. 1997 to Aug. 1998.

The single detected periodicity of 7209 s, although weak, is consistent with theoretical expectations as a function of wavelength.Furthermore, it allows us to rule out a degree index of l= 3 or l= 5 for that mode

The WHO surveillance threshold and the emergence of drug-resistant HIV strains in Botswana (Raffaele Vardavas - 14 December, 2005)
We discuss the implications of our results for the World Health Organization's (WHO's) proposed surveillance system for detecting drug-resistant strains of HIV in Africa. Results: Our results show - even if rates of acquired resistance are high, but the drug-resistant strains that evolve are only half as transmissible as wild-type strains - that transmission of drug-resistant strains will remain low (< 5% by 2009) and are unlikely to exceed the WHO's surveillance threshold. However,our results show that transmission of drug-resistant strains in Botswana could increase to ~15% by 2009 if resistant strains are as transmissible as wild-type strains. Conclusion: The WHO's surveillance system is designed to detect transmitted resistance that exceeds a threshold level of 5%. Whether this system will detect drug-resistant strains in Botswana by 2009 will depend upon the transmissibility of the strains that emerge

The red optical afterglow of GRB 030725 (G. Pugliese - 12 May, 2005)
An optical counterpart was identified at the Bronberg Observatory in South Africa about 7 hours after the burst occurred. The optical afterglow (OA) was observed between 4 and 15 days after the burst with the 1.54m Danish telescope at La Silla in the V, Rc, and Ic bands. We fit a broken power law to the data and determine a break time in the light curve between 16 hours and 4.7 days after the first detection of the burst. The decay slope is alpha1 = -0.59 +0.59/-0.44 before and alpha2 = -1.43 +/- 0.06 after the break. A bump may be present in the light curve, only significant at the 2-sigma level, 13.9 days after the main burst. The spectral slope of the OA, measured 12 days after the burst, is -2.9 +/- 0.6 , i.e. Observations of the field 8 months after the burst with the EMMI instrument on the NTT telescope (La Silla) resulted in an upper limit of Rc=24.7 mag for the host galaxy of GRB 030725. The OA of GRB 030725 was discovered at a private, non-professional observatory and we point out that with the current suite of gamma ray satellites, an effort to organize future contributions of amateur observers may provide substantial help in GRB light curve follow up efforts.

Ionospheric response to the total solar eclipse of June 21, 2001 (E. L. Afraimovich - 24 January, 2002)
This study is based on using the data from three stations of the global GPS network located in the area of the totality band in Africa. This period was characterized by a low level of geomagnetic disturbance (the Dst-index varied from -6 to 22 nT), which alleviated greatly the problem of detecting the ionospheric response to eclipse

Limb-Darkening of a K Giant in the Galactic Bulge: PLANET Photometry of MACHO 97-BLG-28 ( The PLANET Collaboration - 7 May, 1999)
The microlensed source, demonstrated to be a K giant by our independent spectroscopy, crossed the central isolated cusp of the lensing binary, generating a sharp peak in the light curve that was well-resolved by dense (3 - 30 minute) and continuous monitoring from PLANET sites in Chile, South Africa, and Australia. Modeling indicates that the lensing binary has a mass ratio q = 0.23 and an (instantaneous) separation in units of the angular Einstein ring radius of d = 0.69 . For a lens in the Galactic bulge, this corresponds to a typical stellar binary with a projected separation between 1 and 2 AU. Assuming that the source is a bulge K2 giant at 8 kpc, the relative lens-source proper motion is mu = 19.4 +/- 2.6 km/s /kpc, consistent with a disk or bulge lens

The level spacing distribution $P(S)$ and the number variance $Î£^{2}(L)$ have been studied for 13 different shape parameters on the interval ($0\le\lam\le0.2$). The exponent of the level repulsion has been analysed and is found to change smoothly from 0 to 2 as the dynamics goes from integrable to ergodic

East africa in the Malthusian trap? A statistical analysis of financial, economic, and demographic indicators (Andrey Korotayev - 29 March, 2015)
