Analysis of the generalization error: Empirical risk minimization over deep artificial neural networks overcomes the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of Black-Scholes partial differential equations (Julius Berner - 9 September, 2018)
Kolmogorov PDEs have been widely used in models from engineering, finance, and the natural sciences. In particular we show that for Kolmogorov PDEs with affine drift and diffusion coefficients and a given accuracy $\varepsilon>0$, ERM over deep neural network hypothesis classes of size scaling polynomially in the dimension $d$ and $\varepsilon^{-1}$ and with a number of training samples scaling polynomially in the dimension $d$ and $\varepsilon^{-1}$ approximates the solution of the Kolmogorov PDE to within accuracy $\varepsilon$ with high probability

Through thorough studies on over 10 million stock-relevant tweets and 3 million investors from Weibo, it is revealed that inexperienced investors with high emotional volatility are more sensible to the market fluctuations than the experienced or institutional ones, and their dominant occupation also indicates that the Chinese market might be more emotional as compared to its western counterparts

A Domain Specific Approach to High Performance Heterogeneous Computing (Gordon Inggs - 14 March, 2016)
These claims are illustrated using the example domain of derivatives pricing in computational finance, with the domain metrics of workload latency or makespan and pricing accuracy. For a large, varied workload of 128 Black-Scholes and Heston model-based option pricing tasks, running upon a diverse array of 16 Multicore CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs platforms, predictions made by models of both the makespan and accuracy are generally within 10% of the run-time performance. When these models are used as inputs to machine learning and MILP-based workload allocation approaches, a latency improvement of up to 24 and 270 times over the heuristic approach is seen.
