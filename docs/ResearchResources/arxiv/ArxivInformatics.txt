Methodic of joint using the tools of automation of lexical and parsing analysis in the process of teaching the programming theory of future informatics teachers (S. O. Semerikov - 4 July, 2018)
The example of the MosML dialect illustrates the main components of the methodic of joint using the tools of automation of lexical and parsing analysis in the process of teaching the programming theory of future informatics teachers. The main conclusions and recommendations: 1) the considered example of the expanded calculator can be refined by changing the grammar, in particular - for the introduction of conditional and cyclic constructions; 2) the proposed scheme can be used to implement the interpreter of any formal language with an arbitrary typing method - the appropriate examples of study will be subsets of procedural languages Basic and C and functional languages Scheme and SML: provided the addition of the machine code generation phase, this provides an opportunity to demonstrate the full development cycle for programming language compiler.

Enumerating Top-k Quasi-Cliques (Seyed-Vahid Sanei-Mehri - 28 August, 2018)
Enumerating quasi-cliques from a graph is a robust way to detect densely connected structures with applications to bio-informatics and social network analysis. Our method is based on identifying kernels of extremely dense subgraphs within a graph, following by growing subgraphs around these kernels, to arrive at quasi-cliques with the required densities (3) Experimental results show that our algorithm accurately enumerates quasi-cliques from a graph, is much faster than current state-of-the-art methods for quasi-clique enumeration (often more than three orders of magnitude faster), and can scale to larger graphs than current methods.
