Realizing Learned Quadruped Locomotion Behaviors through Kinematic Motion Primitives (Abhik Singla - 9 October, 2018)
Humans and animals are believed to use a very minimal set of trajectories to perform a wide variety of tasks including walking. Our main objective in this paper is two fold 1) Obtain an effective tool to realize these basic motion patterns for quadrupedal walking, called the kinematic motion primitives (kMPs), via trajectories learned from deep reinforcement learning (D-RL) and 2) Realize a set of behaviors, namely trot, walk, gallop and bound from these kinematic motion primitives in our custom four legged robot, called the 'Stoch'

Episodic Curiosity through Reachability (Nikolay Savinov - 4 October, 2018)
In particular, inspired by curious behaviour in animals, observing something novel could be rewarded with a bonus. In ViZDoom, our agent learns to successfully navigate to a distant goal at least 2 times faster than the state-of-the-art curiosity method ICM. In DMLab, our agent generalizes well to new procedurally generated levels of the game - reaching the goal at least 2 times more frequently than ICM on test mazes with very sparse reward.

Viewing the coverage measure as the social welfare, this policy thus enjoys a (Symmetric) Price of Anarchy of precisely 1, whereas, in fact, any other congestion policy has a price strictly greater than 1

Remarkably, even when a small number of frames are labeled ($\approx 200$), the algorithm achieves excellent tracking performance on test frames that is comparable to human accuracy.

The global affine registration uses a multi-resolution pyramid on image volumes of 3 levels whereas in local B-spline registration, a multi-resolution scheme is applied on the B-spline grid of 2 levels on the finest resolution of the image volumes in which only the transform itself is affected rather than the image volumes

Distributed Recurrent Neural Forward Models with Synaptic Adaptation for Complex Behaviors of Walking Robots (Sakyasingha Dasgupta - 11 June, 2015)
Such predictions or planning ahead can be achieved by way of in- ternal models that are grounded in the overall behavior of the animal. The neural mechanisms consist of 1) central pattern generator based control for generating basic rhythmic patterns and coordinated movements, 2) distributed (at each leg) recurrent neural network based adaptive forward models with efference copies as internal models for sensory predictions and instantaneous state estimations, and 3) searching and elevation control for adapting the movement of an individual leg to deal with different environmental conditions

Robots that can adapt like animals (Antoine Cully - 27 May, 2015)
However, while animals can quickly adapt to a wide variety of injuries, current robots cannot "think outside the box" to find a compensatory behavior when damaged: they are limited to their pre-specified self-sensing abilities, can diagnose only anticipated failure modes, and require a pre-programmed contingency plan for every type of potential damage, an impracticality for complex robots. Experiments reveal successful adaptations for a legged robot injured in five different ways, including damaged, broken, and missing legs, and for a robotic arm with joints broken in 14 different ways

Collaborative search on the plane without communication (Ofer Feinerman - 24 January, 2017)
We generalize the classical cow-path problem [7, 14, 38, 39] into a question that is relevant for collective foraging in animal groups. Indeed, it is a straightforward observation that the time required for finding the treasure is $Î©$(D + D 2 /k), and we show in this paper that this bound can be matched if the agents have knowledge of k up to some constant approximation. On the other hand, we show that for every constant $Îµ\textgreater{} 0$, there exists a rather simple uniform search algorithm which is $O( \log^{1+Îµ} k)$-competitive. As a special case, this lower bound implies that for any constant $Îµ\textgreater{} 0$, if each agent is given a (one-sided) $k^Îµ$-approximation to k, then the competitiveness is $Î©$(log k)

Nevertheless, instead of being limited to perceive simple features, human and other advanced animals adaptively learn the world into categories and abstract concepts from experiences, imparting the world meanings

Queuing models for abstracting interactions in Bacterial communities (NicolÃ² Michelusi - 10 January, 2016)
Microbial communities play a significant role in bioremediation,plant growth,human and animal digestion,global elemental cycles including the carbon-cycle,and water treatment.They are also posed to be the engines of renewable energy via microbial fuel cells which can reverse the process of electrosynthesis.Microbial communication regulates many virulence mechanisms used by bacteria.Thus,it is of fundamental importance to understand interactions in microbial communities and to develop predictive tools that help control them,in order to aid the design of systems exploiting bacterial capabilities.This position paper explores how abstractions from communications,networking and information theory can play a role in understanding and modeling bacterial interactions.In particular,two forms of interactions in bacterial systems will be examined:electron transfer and quorum sensing.While the diffusion of chemical signals has been heavily studied,electron transfer occurring in living cells and its role in cell-cell interaction is less understood.Recent experimental observations open up new frontiers in the design of microbial systems based on electron transfer,which may coexist with the more well-known interaction strategies based on molecular diffusion.In quorum sensing,the concentration of certain signature chemical compounds emitted by the bacteria is used to estimate the bacterial population size,so as to activate collective behaviors.In this position paper,queuing models for electron transfer are summarized and adapted to provide new models for quorum sensing.These models are stochastic,and thus capture the inherent randomness exhibited by cell colonies in nature.It is shown that queuing models allow the characterization of the state of a single cell as a function of interactions with other cells and the environment,while being amenable to complexity reduction.

Optical Flow Sensing and the Inverse Perception Problem for Flying Bats (Zhaodan Kong - 12 March, 2013)
The movements of birds, bats, and other flying species are governed by complex sensorimotor systems that allow the animals to react to stationary environmental features as well as to wind disturbances, other animals in nearby airspace, and a wide variety of unexpected challenges. Using an idealized geometry of bat eyes, we introduce the concept of time-to-transit, and recall some research that suggests that this quantity is computed by the animals' visual cortex
