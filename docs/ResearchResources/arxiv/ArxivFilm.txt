Self-Supervised Generation of Spatial Audio for 360 Video (Pedro Morgado - 7 September, 2018)

Migrating Knowledge between Physical Scenarios based on Artificial Neural Networks (Yurui Qu - 27 August, 2018)
First, we demonstrate that in predicting the transmission from multilayer photonic film, the relative error rate is reduced by 46.8% (26.5%) when the source data comes from 10-layer (8-layer) films and the target data comes from 8-layer (10-layer) films. Second, we show that the relative error rate is decreased by 22% when knowledge is transferred between two very different physical scenarios: transmission from multilayer films and scattering from multilayer nanoparticles

Personal space of autonomous car's passengers sitting in the driver's seat (Eleonore Ferrier-Barbut - 9 May, 2018)
Our experiment includes 19 volunteers using a virtual reality headset to look at 30 scenarios filmed in 360{\textdegree} from the point of view of a passenger sitting in the driver's seat of an autonomous car.They were asked to say "stop" when they felt discomfort visualizing the scenarios.As said, the scenarios voluntarily avoid collision effect as we do not want to measure fear but discomfort.The scenarios involve one or three pedestrians walking past the car at different distances from the wings of the car, relative to the direction of motion of the car, on both sides. In contrast, the feeling of discomfort is relative to the car's motion (static or moving).Another outcome from this study is an illustration of the usage of first person 360{\textdegree} video and a virtual reality headset to evaluate feelings of a passenger within an autonomous car.

Ultrafast photo-magnetic recording in transparent medium (A. Stupakiewicz - 7 August, 2016)

Changing the polarization of the laser pulse we deterministically steer the net magnetization in the garnet, write "0" and "1" magnetic bits at will. This mechanism operates at room temperature and allows ever fastest write-read magnetic recording event (< 20 ps) accompanied by unprecedentedly low heat load (< 6 J/cm3).

The percentage of blue-white areas detected in a lesion combined with a simple shape descriptor yielded a sensitivity of 69.35% and a specificity of 89.97% on a set of 545 dermoscopy images. The sensitivity rises to 78.20% for detection of blue veil in those cases where it is a primary feature for melanoma recognition.

Game of Drones - Detecting Streamed POI from Encrypted FPV Channel (Ben Nassi - 9 January, 2018)
Although many methods have been suggested to detect nearby drones, they all suffer from the same shortcoming: they cannot identify exactly what is being captured, and therefore they fail to distinguish between the legitimate use of a drone (for example, to use a drone to film a selfie from the air) and illegitimate use that invades someone's privacy (when the same operator uses the drone to stream the view into the window of his neighbor's apartment), a distinction that in some cases depends on the orientation of the drone's video camera rather than on the drone's location

Reconciling MPEG-7 and MPEG-21 Semantics through a Common Event-Aware Metadata Model (Jane Hunter - 21 October, 2002)
During the typical life cycle of multimedia content, events occur at many different levels - from the events which happen during content creation (directing, acting, camera panning and zooming) to the events which happen to the physical form (acquisition, relocation, damage of film or video) to the digital conversion, reformatting, editing and repackaging events, to the events which are depicted in the actual content (political, news, sporting) to the usage, ownership and copyright agreement events and even the metadata attribution events

Chip-level CMP Modeling and Smart Dummy for HDP and Conformal CVD Films (George Yong Liu - 9 November, 2000)
Chip-level CMP modeling is investigated to obtain the post-CMP film profile thickness across a die from its design layout file and a few film deposition and CMP parameters. The work covers both HDP and conformal CVD film
