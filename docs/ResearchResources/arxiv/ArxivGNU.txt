Timelines for In-Code Discovery of Zero-Day Vulnerabilities and Supply-Chain Attacks (Andrew J. Lohn - 31 August, 2018)
We analyze the version-to-version changes in three types of open source software (Mozilla Firefox, GNU/Linus, and glibc) to understand the rate at which the various pieces of code are amended and find that much of the revision behavior can be captured with a simple intuitive model. We use that model and the data from over a billion unique lines of code in 87 different versions of software to specify the bounds for in-code discoverability of vulnerabilities - from expertly hidden to obviously observable.

oo7: Low-overhead Defense against Spectre Attacks via Binary Analysis (Guanhua Wang - 19 July, 2018)
Due to the accuracy of our analysis, oo7 suggests inserting less fences, and is shown experimentally to impose acceptably low performance overheads; less than 2% performance overhead is observed in our experiments on GNU Core utilities. Moreover, the accuracy of the analysis allows oo7 to effectively detect fourteen (14) out of the fifteen (15) Spectre vulnerable code patterns proposed by Paul Kocher, a feat that could not be achieved by the Spectre mitigation in C/C++ compiler proposed by Microsoft

Simultaneous Solving of Batched Linear Programs on a GPU (Amit Gurung - 21 February, 2018)
The performance of the batched LP solver is compared against sequential solving in the CPU using the open source solver GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit) and the CPLEX solver from IBM. The evaluation on selected LP benchmarks from the Netlib repository displays a maximum speed-up of 95x and 5x with respect to CPLEX and GLPK solver respectively, for a batch of 1e5 LPs

Deep Neural Network Architectures for Modulation Classification (Xiaoyu Liu - 5 January, 2018)
Recently in [1], a framework has been introduced by generating a dataset using GNU radio that mimics the imperfections in a real wireless channel, and uses 10 different modulation types. Here, we follow the framework of [1] and find deep neural network architectures that deliver higher accuracy than the state of the art. We tested the architecture of [1] and found it to achieve an accuracy of approximately 75% of correctly recognizing the modulation type. We first tune the CNN architecture of [1] and find a design with four convolutional layers and two dense layers that gives an accuracy of approximately 83.8% at high SNR. We then develop architectures based on the recently introduced ideas of Residual Networks (ResNet [2]) and Densely Connected Networks (DenseNet [3]) to achieve high SNR accuracies of approximately 83.5% and 86.6%, respectively. Finally, we introduce a Convolutional Long Short-term Deep Neural Network (CLDNN [4]) to achieve an accuracy of approximately 88.5% at high SNR.

BinPro: A Tool for Binary Source Code Provenance (Dhaval Miyani - 2 November, 2017)

Our experiments show that on average BinPro computes a similarity of 81% for matching binaries and source code of the same applications, and an average similarity of 25% for binaries and source code of similar but different applications

Benchmarking the computing resources at the Instituto de AstrofÃ­sica de Canarias (Nicola Caon - 16 February, 2017)
In particular, we run the "Polyhedron Fortran Benchmarks" suite, using three different compilers: GNU Fortran Compiler, Intel Fortran Compiler and the PGI Fortran Compiler; execution times are then normalized to the reference values published by Polyhedron. The same tests were run multiple times on a same PCs, and on 3 to 5 PCs of the same model (whenever possible) to check for repeatability and consistency of the results. We found that in general execution times, for a given PC model, are consistent within an uncertainty of about 10%, and show a gain in CPU speed of a factor of about 3 between the oldest PCs used at the IAC (7-8 years old) and the newest ones.

Solving Batched Linear Programs on GPU and Multicore CPU (Amit Gurung - 26 September, 2016)
The performance of the batched LP solver is compared against sequential solving in the CPU using an open source solver GLPK (GNU Linear Programming Kit). For the first type, we show a maximum speedup of $18.3\times$ when running a batch of $50k$ LPs of size $100$ ($100$ variables, $100$ constraints). For the second type, a maximum speedup of $12\times$ is obtained with a batch of $10k$ LPs of size $200$. For the third type, we show a significant speedup of $63\times$ in solving a batch of nearly $4$ million LPs of size 5 and $34\times$ in solving 6 million LPs of size $28$. The thread parallel GLPK implementation runs $9.6\times$ faster in solving a batch of $1e5$ LPs of size $100$, on a $12$-core Intel Xeon processor

Although this is a time-consuming process, our approach constructs an optimized variation of -O3, which we call -Ocm3, that realizes nearly two thirds of known available gains on the CM3 and significantly outperforms a more complex state-of-the-art predictive method in cross-validation experiments

On the Implementation of GNU Prolog (Daniel Diaz - 15 December, 2010)
GNU Prolog also includes an extensible and high-performance finite domain constraint solver, integrated with the Prolog language but implemented using independent lower-level mechanisms. This article discusses the main issues involved in designing and implementing GNU Prolog: requirements, system organization, performance and portability issues as well as its position with respect to other Prolog system implementations and the ISO standardization initiative.

Octave-GTK: A GTK binding for GNU Octave (Muthiah Annamalai - 28 April, 2006)
This paper discusses the problems faced with interoperability between two programming languages, with respect to GNU Octave, and GTK API written in C, to provide the GTK API on Octave.Octave-GTK is the fusion of two different API's: one exported by GNU Octave [scientific computing tool] and the other GTK [GUI toolkit]; this enables one to use GTK primitives within GNU Octave, to build graphical front ends,at the same time using octave engine for number crunching power
