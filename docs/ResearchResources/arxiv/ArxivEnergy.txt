Rate-Accuracy Trade-Off In Video Classification With Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (Mohammad Jubran - 27 September, 2018)
This necessitates the transport of compressed video over networks and incurs significant overhead in bandwidth and energy consumption, thereby significantly undermining the deployment potential of such systems. Based on three CNN architectures and two action recognition datasets, we achieve 11%-94% saving in bitrate with marginal effect on classification accuracy. A model-based selection between multiple CNNs increases these savings further, to the point where, if up to 7% loss of accuracy can be tolerated, video classification can take place with as little as 3 kbps for the transport of the required compressed video information to the system implementing the CNN models.

Studies on the energy and deep memory behaviour of a cache-oblivious, task-based hyperbolic PDE solver (Dominic E. Charrier - 9 October, 2018)

However, in cases where memory-intense and computationally expensive tasks overlap, ExaHype's cache-oblivious implementation can exploit the Intel Memory Drive Technology (IMDT) virtualizing the extra memory layer, and it suffers only from a less than 3x performance decline per degree of freedom versus pure DDR4 memory

Prefix-Free Code Distribution Matching for Probabilistic Constellation Shaping (Junho Cho - 4 October, 2018)
Under stringent constraints of 4096 entries or below per codebook, the constructed codes yield an energy per code letter within a few tenths of a dB of the unconstrained theoretic lower bound, across a wide range of entropy rates with a very fine granularity. The penalty caused by framing is studied using simulations and analysis, showing that the energy per code letter is kept within 0.2 dB of the unconstrained theoretic limit for some tested codes with a large frame length. When framed prefix-free codes are used to implement probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) for communications in the additive white Gaussian noise channel, simulations show that 1.1 dB and 0.65 dB of shaping gains are achieved relative to uniform 8- and 16-quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), respectively.

NetAdapt: Platform-Aware Neural Network Adaptation for Mobile Applications (Tien-Ju Yang - 28 September, 2018)

Analysis of CSAT performance in Wi-Fi and LTE-U Coexistence (Vanlin Sathya - 5 April, 2018)
In this paper, we study energy-based Carrier Sense Adaptive Transmission (CSAT) for use with LTE-U and investigate the performance in Wi-Fi/LTE-U coexistence using theoretical analysis and experimental verification using NI USRPs. According to the LTE-U forum specification, if an LTE-U base station (BS) finds a vacant channel, it can transmit for up to 20 ms and turn OFF its transmission for only 1 ms, resulting in a maximum duty cycle of 95%. It will start transmission by trying to transmit association packets (using carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)) through the 1 ms LTE-U OFF duration. Once LTE-U, using CSAT, detects Wi-Fi, it should scale back the duty cycle to 50%. We demonstrate in this paper, using an experimental platform as well as theoretical analysis, that if LTE-U is using a 95% duty cycle, energy based CSAT will take a much longer time to scale back the duty cycle due to the beacon drops and delays in the reception. Hence, in order to maintain association fairness with Wi-Fi, we propose that a LTE-U BS should not transmit at maximum duty cycles (95%), even if the channel is sensed to be vacant.

In scenario 2), the optimal fraction of training time can be characterized by a simple equation

Next, we use 69 DM cases collected from the hospital located at Zhejiang University, China to generate "virtual" recombined images. Using DM alone provides 0.91 in accuracy, whereas SD-CNN improves the diagnostic accuracy to 0.95.

For CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, and models with 1-bit-per-weight requiring less than 10 MB of parameter memory, we achieve error rates of 3.9%, 18.5% and 26.0% / 8.5% (Top-1 / Top-5) respectively.

Energy Optimization of Robotic Cells (Libor Bukata - 16 February, 2018)
A holistic approach that considers a robotic cell as a whole toward minimizing energy consumption is proposed. The experimental results showed that the heuristic solved 93 % of instances with a solution quality close to a proven lower bound. Moreover, compared with the existing works, which typically address problems with three to four robots, this study solved real-size problem instances with up to 12 robots and considered more optimization aspects. The outcomes, based on simulations and measurements, indicate that, compared with the previous state (at maximal robot speeds and without deeper power-saving modes), the energy consumption can be reduced by about 20 % merely by optimizing the robot speeds and applying power-saving modes

Channel Reconstruction-Based Hybrid Precoding for Millimeter Wave Multi-User MIMO Systems (Miguel R. Castellanos - 14 February, 2018)
A typical method to generate the beam weights is to use only the best beam for each user and either steer energy along this beam, or to utilize this information to reduce multi-user interference. This construction relies on three main innovations: 1) Additional feedback to allow the base-station to reconstruct a rank-P approximation of the channel matrix between it and each user, 2) A zeroforcing structure that leverages this information to combat multi-user interference by remaining agnostic of the receiver beam knowledge in the precoder design, and 3) A hybrid precoding architecture that allows both amplitude and phase control at low-complexity and cost to allow the implementation of the zeroforcing structure

One-Bit Precoding and Constellation Range Design for Massive MIMO with QAM Signaling (Foad Sohrabi - 14 March, 2018)
The use of low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) for transmit precoding provides crucial energy efficiency advantage for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) implementation. It is shown that in the massive MIMO limit, a reasonable choice for constellation range with one-bit precoding is that of the infinite-resolution precoding with per-symbol power constraint, but reduced by a factor of $\sqrt{2/Ï}$ or about $0.8$. In term of number of antennas, one-bit precoding requires about 50% more antennas to achieve the same performance as infinite-resolution precoding.

The resulting scheme combines the advantages offered by the counting rule (efficient utilization of the network's communication bandwidth, since the local decisions are transmitted in binary form to the fusion center) and ordering sensor transmissions (bandwidth efficiency, since the fusion center need not wait for all the $N$ sensors to transmit their local decisions), thereby leading to significant energy savings

Wireless Powered Communication Networks: TDD or FDD? (Arman Ahmadian - 16 July, 2018)
Yet, TDD does not allow the energy transmitter to function continuously, which means to deliver the same amount of energy as that in FDD, the transmitter has to have a higher maximum transmit power. On the other hand, when regulations for power spectral density limits are not restrictive, using FDD may lead to higher throughput than that of TDD by allocating less bandwidth to energy and therefore leaving more bandwidth for data

Latency-Energy Tradeoff based on Channel Scheduling and Repetitions in NB-IoT Systems (Amin Azari - 15 July, 2018)
However, those repetitions necessarily increase the energy consumption and the latency in the whole NB-IoT system. These results are subsequently employed in investigation of latency-energy tradeoff in NB-IoT channel scheduling as well as determining the optimized operation points

Backscatter-assisted Relaying in Wireless Powered Communications Network (Yuan Zheng - 14 July, 2018)
In particular, we exploit the use of backscatter communication during the wireless energy transfer phase such that the helping relay user can harvest energy and receive the information from the weaker user simultaneously. We derive the maximum common throughput performance by jointly optimizing the time duration and power allocations on wireless energy and information transmissions
