Global Software Development: Practices for Cultural Differences (Marcelo Marinho - 4 October, 2018)
The literature on culture in GSD is either outdated or disparate, requiring practitioners to read many papers to get an overview of how to manage multi-cultural teams. A synthesis of solutions found in nineteen studies provided 12 distinct practices that organizations can implement, to include, "provide a cultural knowledge base", "understand and make team members aware of cultural differences" and "plan responses to mitigate occurrences of cultural misunderstandings"

Cross-Cultural and Cultural-Specific Production and Perception of Facial Expressions of Emotion in the Wild (Ramprakash Srinivasan - 13 August, 2018)
We find that of the 16,384 possible facial configurations that people can theoretically produce, only 35 are successfully used to transmit emotive information across cultures, and only 8 within a smaller number of cultures. Additionally, we find that the number of expressions used to communicate each emotion is also different, e.g., 17 expressions transmit happiness, but only 1 is used to convey disgust.

What Happens After You Both Swipe Right: A Statistical Description of Mobile Dating Communications (Jennie Zhang - 12 July, 2016)
In addition to becoming an influential part of modern dating culture, MDAs facilitate a unique form of mediated communication: dyadic mobile text messages between pairs of users who are not already acquainted. This paper looks at one of these sets of data: metadata of approximately two million conversations, containing 19 million messages, exchanged between 400,000 heterosexual users on an MDA. For instance, we report that men initiate 79% of conversations--and while about half of the initial messages are responded to, conversations initiated by men are more likely to be reciprocated. That said, the majority of reciprocated conversations lead to a phone number exchange within the first 20 messages.

Topical differences between Chinese language Twitter and Sina Weibo (Qian Zhang - 22 December, 2015)
In this study, we contrast the discussions occurring on Sina Weibo and on Chinese language Twitter in order to observe two different strands of Chinese culture: people within China who use Sina Weibo with its government imposed restrictions and those outside that are free to speak completely anonymously. Using a large corpus of Weibo and Chinese language tweets, covering the period from January $1$ to December $31$, $2012$, we obtain a list of topics using clustered \#tags that we can then use to compare the two platforms. Surprisingly, we find that there are no common entries among the Top $100$ most popular topics. Furthermore, only $9.2\%$ of tweets correspond to the Top $1000$ topics on Sina Weibo platform, and conversely only $4.4\%$ of weibos were found to discuss the most popular Twitter topics

Highlighting Entanglement of Cultures via Ranking of Multilingual Wikipedia Articles (Young-Ho Eom - 8 October, 2013)
How different cultures evaluate a person? Is an important person in one culture is also important in the other culture? We address these questions via ranking of multilingual Wikipedia articles. With three ranking algorithms based on network structure of Wikipedia, we assign ranking to all articles in 9 multilingual editions of Wikipedia and investigate general ranking structure of PageRank, CheiRank and 2DRank. In particular, we focus on articles related to persons, identify top 30 persons for each rank among different editions and analyze distinctions of their distributions over activity fields such as politics, art, science, religion, sport for each edition

Collection security management at university libraries: assessment of its implementation status (A. A. Maidabino - 22 January, 2013)
A "house" model was proposed consisting of five factors; collection security governance, operations and processes, people issues, physical and technical issues and the security culture in libraries. An assessment instrument listing items covering the five factors was pilot tested on 61 samples comprising chief librarians, deputy librarians, departmental, sectional heads and professional staff working in four university libraries in Nigeria. Reliability tests indicate that all five factors are reliable with Cronbach's alpha values between 0.7 and 0.9, indicating that the instrument can be used for wider distribution to explore and assess the level of collection security implementation in university libraries from a holistic perspective.

Evolving Culture vs Local Minima (Yoshua Bengio - 29 November, 2012)
We propose a theory that relates difficulty of learning in deep architectures to culture and language. It is articulated around the following hypotheses: (1) learning in an individual human brain is hampered by the presence of effective local minima; (2) this optimization difficulty is particularly important when it comes to learning higher-level abstractions, i.e., concepts that cover a vast and highly-nonlinear span of sensory configurations; (3) such high-level abstractions are best represented in brains by the composition of many levels of representation, i.e., by deep architectures; (4) a human brain can learn such high-level abstractions if guided by the signals produced by other humans, which act as hints or indirect supervision for these high-level abstractions; and (5), language and the recombination and optimization of mental concepts provide an efficient evolutionary recombination operator, and this gives rise to rapid search in the space of communicable ideas that help humans build up better high-level internal representations of their world

The Framework identifies (1) objectives of the agile philosophy, (2) principles that support the objectives, (3) practices that are reflective of the principles, (4) the linkages between the objectives, principles and practices, and (5) indicators for each practice to assess the effectiveness of the practice and the extent to which the organization supports its implementation

Social interaction as a heuristic for combinatorial optimization problems (Jose F. Fontanari - 4 November, 2010)
The interactions are such that the agents' strings (or cultures) become more similar to the low-cost strings of their neighbors resulting in the dissemination of these strings across the lattice. We find through extensive simulations that the probability of finding the optimal solution is a function of the reduced variable $F/N^{1/4}$ so that the number of agents must increase with the fourth power of the problem size, $N \propto F^ 4$, to guarantee a fixed probability of success. In this case, we find that the relaxation time to reach an absorbing configuration scales with $F^ 6$ which can be interpreted as the overall computational cost of the ACH to find an optimal set of weights for a Boolean Binary Perceptron, given a fixed probability of success.

Correlation of Expert and Search Engine Rankings (Michael L. Nelson - 21 October, 2008)
Does their expert ranking correlate with the search engine ranking of the URLs of those business schools? To answer this question we conducted 9 experiments using 8 expert rankings on a range of academic, athletic, financial and popular culture topics. We compared the expert rankings with the rankings in Google, Live Search (formerly MSN) and Yahoo (with list lengths of 10, 25, and 50). In 57 search engine vs. expert comparisons, only 1 strong and 4 moderate correlations were statistically significant. In 42 inter-search engine comparisons, only 2 strong and 4 moderate correlations were statistically significant. The correlations appeared to decrease with the size of the lists: the 3 strong correlations were for lists of 10, the 8 moderate correlations were for lists of 25, and no correlations were found for lists of 50.

Software Libraries and Their Reuse: Entropy, Kolmogorov Complexity, and Zipf's Law (Todd L. Veldhuizen - 2 October, 2005)
The analysis developed in this paper paints a different picture: the extent to which software reuse can occur is an intrinsic property of a problem domain, and better tools and culture can have only marginal impact on reuse rates if the domain is inherently resistant to reuse. For ``low entropy'' domains with $H$ near 0, programs are highly similar to one another and the domain is amenable to the Component-Based Software Engineering (CBSE) dream of programming by composing large-scale components. For problem domains with $H$ near 1, programs require substantial quantities of new code, with only a modest proportion of an application comprised of reused, small-scale components

What does a convolutional neural network recognize in the moon? (Daigo Shoji - 21 August, 2017)
Although the pattern corresponds to the actual variation in composition of the lunar surface, the culture and environment of each society influence the recognition of these objects (i.e., symbols) as specific entities. In human recognition, before we find similarities between the lunar maria and objects such as animals, we may be persuaded in advance to see a particular image from our culture and environment and then adjust the lunar pattern to the shape of the imagined object.
