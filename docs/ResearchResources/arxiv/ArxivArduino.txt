Design and construction of a desktop AC susceptometer using an Arduino and a Bluetooth for serial interface (Israel Perez - 5 April, 2018)
The Arduino/bluetooth serial interface allows the user to have a connection to almost any computer and thus avoids the problem of connectivity between the computer and the peripherals such as the lock-in amplifier and the function generator. To test our instrument we performed measurements on magnetic materials and show that the system is reliable at both room temperature and cryogenic temperatures (77 K)

Time-Resolved and Temperature Tuneable Measurements of Fluorescent Intensity using a Smartphone Fluorimeter (Md Arafat Hossain - 28 February, 2017)
All components are controlled using a smartphone battery powered Arduino microcontroller and a customised Android application that allows sequential fluorescence imaging and quantification every DELTA t = 4 seconds. The normalised fluorescence intensity over time of the latter chemosensor dye complex in the presence of Zn ion is observed to accelerate with an increasing rate constant, k = 1.94 min-1 at T = 15 C and k = 3.64 min-1 at T = 30 C, approaching a factor of ~ 2 with only a change in temperature of DELTA T = 15 C
