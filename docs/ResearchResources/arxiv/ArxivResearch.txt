DYVERSE: DYnamic VERtical Scaling in Multi-tenant Edge Environments (Nan Wang - 19 September, 2018)
An online-game and a face detection workload in a Cloud-Edge test-bed are used to validate the research. The merits of DYVERSE is that there is only a sub-second overhead per Edge server when 32 Edge servers are deployed on a single Edge node. When compared to executing applications on the Edge servers without dynamic vertical scaling, static priorities and dynamic priorities reduce SLO violation rates of requests by up to 4% and 12% for the online game, respectively, and in both cases 6% for the face detection workload

Comparison of U-net-based Convolutional Neural Networks for Liver Segmentation in CT (Hans Meine - 9 October, 2018)
Various approaches for liver segmentation in CT have been proposed: Besides statistical shape models, which played a major role in this research area, novel approaches on the basis of convolutional neural networks have been introduced recently. Using a set of 219 liver CT datasets with reference segmentations from liver surgery planning, we evaluate the performance of several neural network classifiers based on 2D and 3D U-net architectures. An interesting observation is that slice-wise approaches perform surprisingly well, with mean and median Dice coefficients above 0.97, and may be preferable over 3D approaches given current hardware and software limitations.

Text Classification of the Precursory Accelerating Seismicity Corpus: Inference on some Theoretical Trends in Earthquake Predictability Research from 1988 to 2018 (Arnaud Mignan - 5 October, 2018)
We investigate rather the classification process can be automatized to help analyze larger corpora in order to better understand trends in earthquake predictability research. We find that the Naive Bayes model performs best, in agreement with the machine learning literature for the case of small datasets, with cross-validation accuracies of 86% for binary classification. For a refined multiclass classification ('non-critical process' < 'agnostic' < 'critical process assumed' < 'critical process demonstrated'), we obtain up to 78% accuracy. Prediction on a dozen of articles published since 2011 shows however a weak generalization with a F1-score of 60%, only slightly better than a random classifier, which can be explained by a change of authorship and use of different terminologies. Yet, the model shows F1-scores greater than 80% for the two multiclass extremes ('non-critical process' versus 'critical process demonstrated') while it falls to random classifier results (around 25%) for papers labelled 'agnostic' or 'critical process assumed'

DeepGeo: Photo Localization with Deep Neural Network (Sudharshan Suresh - 6 October, 2018)
This research was inspired from playing GeoGuessr, a game that tests a humans' ability to localize themselves using just images of their surroundings. This is framed as a classification problem: given images sampled from the USA, the most-probable state among 50 is predicted. To this end, we create (and open-source) the 50States10K dataset - with 0.5 million Google Street View images of the country. This model achieves an accuracy 20 times better than chance on a test dataset, which rises to 71.87% when taking the best of top-5 guesses. The network also beats human subjects in 4 out of 5 rounds of GeoGuessr.

SCC: Automatic Classification of Code Snippets (Kamel Alreshedy - 21 September, 2018)
Determining the programming language of a source code file has been considered in the research community; it has been shown that Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms can be effective in identifying the programming language of source code files. In this paper, we describe Source Code Classification (SCC), a classifier that can identify the programming language of code snippets written in 21 different programming languages. It is shown to achieve an accuracy of 75% which is higher than that with Programming Languages Identification (PLI a proprietary online classifier of snippets) whose accuracy is only 55.5%. The average score for precision, recall and the F1 score with the proposed tool are 0.76, 0.75 and 0.75, respectively. In addition, it can distinguish between code snippets from a family of programming languages such as C, C++ and C#, and can also identify the programming language version such as C# 3.0, C# 4.0 and C# 5.0.

Categorizing Defects in Infrastructure as Code (Akond Rahman - 21 September, 2018)
We mine open source version control systems collected from four organizations namely, Mirantis, Mozilla, Openstack, and Wikimedia Commons to conduct our research study. We use 1021, 3074, 7808, and 972 commits that map to 165, 580, 1383, and 296 IaC scripts, respectively, collected from Mirantis, Mozilla, Openstack, and Wikimedia Commons. With 89 raters we apply the defect type attribute of the orthogonal defect classification (ODC) methodology to categorize the defects. We also review prior literature that have used ODC to categorize defects, and compare the defect category distribution of IaC scripts with 26 non-IaC software systems. Respectively, for Mirantis, Mozilla, Openstack, and Wikimedia Commons, we observe (i) 49.3%, 36.5%, 57.6%, and 62.7% of the IaC defects to contain syntax and configuration-related defects; (ii) syntax and configuration-related defects are more prevalent amongst IaC scripts compared to that of previously-studied non-IaC software.

Results show a significant degradation in iris recognition reliability manifesting by worsening the genuine scores in all three matchers used in this study (12% of genuine score increase for an academic matcher, up to 175% of genuine score increase obtained for an example commercial matcher)

Social Network Structure is Predictive of Health and Wellness (Suwen Lin - 7 September, 2018)
While researchers have studied social networks as a driver for diffusion of influences and behaviors, it is less understood how the structure or topology of the network, in itself, impacts an individual's health behaviors and wellness state. Using a large longitudinal data set of students enrolled in the NetHealth study at the University of Notre Dame, we show that the NetCARE model improves the overall prediction performance over the baseline models -- that use demographics and physical attributes -- by 38%, 65%, 55%, and 54% for the wellness states -- stress, happiness, positive attitude, and self-assessed health -- considered in this paper.

Researchers have previously shown that Coincidental Correctness (CC) is prevalent; however, the benchmarks they used are considered inadequate nowadays. This entailed manually injecting two code checkers for each of the 395 defects in Defects4J: 1) a weak checker that detects weak CC tests by monitoring whether the defect was reached; and 2) a strong checker that detects strong CC tests by monitoring whether the defect was reached and the program has transitioned into an infectious state. Our study showed that unit testing is not immune to CC, as it exhibited 7.2x more strong CC tests than failing tests and 8.3x more weak CC tests than failing tests

Propagation Measurement System and Approach at 140 GHz-Moving to 6G and Above 100 GHz (Yunchou Xing - 22 August, 2018)
With the relatively recent realization that millimeter wave frequencies are viable for mobile communications, extensive measurements and research have been conducted on frequencies from 0.5 to 100 GHz, and several global wireless standard bodies have proposed channel models for frequencies below 100 GHz. Presently, little is known about the radio channel above 100 GHz where there are much wider unused bandwidth slots available. This paper summarizes wireless communication research and activities above 100 GHz, overviews the results of previously published propagation measurements at D-band (110-170 GHz), provides the design of a 140 GHz wideband channel sounder system, and proposes indoor wideband propagation measurements and penetration measurements for common materials at 140 GHz which were not previously investigated.

Edge Coloring Technique to Remove Small Elementary Trapping Sets from Tanner Graph of QC-LDPC Codes with Column Weight 4 (Mohammad-Reza Sadeghi - 15 August, 2018)
Characterization of $(a,b)$ elementary trapping sets (ETSs), their graphical properties and the lower bounds on their size in variable regular LDPC codes with column weights 3, 4, 5 and 6, where $a$ is the size of the ETS and $b$ is the number of degree-one check nodes, have been an interesting subject among researchers. Although progressive-edge-growth method (PEG) to construct LDPC codes free of an specific ETS has been proposed in the literature, it is mostly applied to LDPC codes with column weight 3. In this paper, we focus on constructing QC-LDPC codes with column weight 4 whose Tanner graphs are free of small ETSs. Using coloring the edges of the variable node (VN) graph corresponding to an ETS, we provide the sufficient conditions to obtain QC-LDPC codes with column weight 4, girth 6 and free of $(5,b)$ ETSs, where $b\leq4$, and $(6,b)$ ETs, where $b\leq2$. Moreover, for $(4,n)$-regular QC-LDPC codes with girth 8, we present a method to remove $(7,4)$ ETSs from Tanner graphs.

Feasibility of 5G mm-wave communication for connected autonomous vehicles (Sakib Mahmud Khan - 13 August, 2018)
In this research, we have evaluated the 5G mm-wave and Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) for different CAV applications in a Network Simulator-3 (ns-3). We have found that 5G mm-wave can support CAV safety applications by ensuring lower latency compared to the required minimum latency of 200 milliseconds for the forward collision warning application. For mobility applications, we have found that 5G mm-wave can support multiple CAVs with a high data receive rate, which is enough for real-time high definition video streaming for in-vehicle infotainment, with mean packet delay of 13 milliseconds

Cross-Cultural and Cultural-Specific Production and Perception of Facial Expressions of Emotion in the Wild (Ramprakash Srinivasan - 13 August, 2018)
Automatic recognition of emotion from facial expressions is an intense area of research, with a potentially long list of important application. We find that of the 16,384 possible facial configurations that people can theoretically produce, only 35 are successfully used to transmit emotive information across cultures, and only 8 within a smaller number of cultures. Additionally, we find that the number of expressions used to communicate each emotion is also different, e.g., 17 expressions transmit happiness, but only 1 is used to convey disgust.

DenseRAN for Offline Handwritten Chinese Character Recognition (Wenchao Wang - 13 August, 2018)
Chinese characters are mainly logographic and consist of basic radicals, however, previous research mostly treated each Chinese character as a whole without explicitly considering its internal two-dimensional structure and radicals. Evaluated on ICDAR-2013 competition database, the proposed approach significantly outperforms whole-character modeling approach with a relative character error rate (CER) reduction of 18.54%. Meanwhile, for the case of recognizing 3277 unseen Chinese characters in CASIA-HWDB1.2 database, DenseRAN can achieve a character accuracy of about 41% while the traditional whole-character method has no capability to handle them.

Learning Multi-touch Conversion Attribution with Dual-attention Mechanisms for Online Advertising (Kan Ren - 29 August, 2018)

To make it worse, the current industry practice is merely employing a set of arbitrary rules as the attribution model, e.g., the popular last-touch model assigns 100% credit to the final touch-point regardless of actual attributions

Monitoring compliance with governmental and institutional open access policies across Spanish universities (Reme Melero - 10 August, 2018)
Universities and research centers in Spain are subject to a national open access (OA) mandate and to their own OA institutional policies, if any, but compliance with these requirements has not been fully monitored yet. We studied the degree of OA archiving of publications of 28 universities within the period 2012-2014. Of these, 12 have an institutional OA mandate, 9 do not require but request or encourage OA of scholarly outputs, and 7 do not have a formal OA statement but are well known for their support of the OA movement. The universities showed an asymmetric distribution of 1% to 63% of articles archived in repositories that matched those indexed by the Web of Science in the same period, of which 1% to 35% were OA and the rest were closed access. However, the analysis of potential OA showed that the figure could have reached 80% in some cases

We evaluate energy consumption on four different networks based on the two most popular ones (ResNet/AlexNet): ResNet (167 layers), a 2D CNN (15 layers), a CaffeNet (25 layers) and a ResNetIm (94 layers) using batch sizes of 64, 128 and 256, and then correlate those with speed-up and accuracy to determine optimal settings. Experimental results on a multi-GPU server endowed with twin Maxwell and twin Pascal Titan X GPUs demonstrate that energy correlates with performance and that Pascal may have up to 40% gains versus Maxwell

An argument in favor of strong scaling for deep neural networks with small datasets (Renato L. de F. Cunha - 25 September, 2018)
One approach to parallelize deep learning models followed by many researchers is based on weak scaling. We evaluated our approach with up to 32 GPUs and show that weak scaling not only does not have the same accuracy as the sequential model, it also fails to converge most of time

Skin Lesion Segmentation Using Atrous Convolution via DeepLab v3 (Yujie Wang - 23 July, 2018)
As melanoma diagnoses increase across the US, automated efforts to identify malignant lesions become increasingly of interest to the research community. Although techniques utilizing convolutional neural networks have been used in the past for lesion segmentation, we present a solution employing the recently published DeepLab 3, an atrous convolution method for image segmentation. Although the results produced by this run are not ideal, with a mean Jaccard index of 0.498, we believe that with further adjustments and modifications to the compatibility with the DeepLab code and with training on more powerful processing units, this method may achieve better results in future trials.

Multimodal Social Media Analysis for Gang Violence Prevention (Philipp Blandfort - 23 July, 2018)
In this paper we partnered computer scientists with social work researchers, who have domain expertise in gang violence, to analyze how public tweets with images posted by youth who mention gang associations on Twitter can be leveraged to automatically detect psychosocial factors and conditions that could potentially assist social workers and violence outreach workers in prevention and early intervention programs. Our multimodal approach provides a very promising improvement (18% relative in mean average precision) over the best single modality approach
