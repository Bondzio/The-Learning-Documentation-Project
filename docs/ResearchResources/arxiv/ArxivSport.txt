Autonomous drone race: A computationally efficient vision-based navigation and control strategy (S. Li - 16 September, 2018)
Drone racing is becoming a popular sport where human pilots have to control their drones to fly at high speed through complex environments and pass a number of gates in a pre-defined sequence. Experiments show that the drone can fly a half-circle with 1.5m radius within 2 seconds with only 30cm error at the end of the circle without any position feedback. The result shows that the drone can complete the track of 15 gates with a speed of 1.5m/s which is faster than the speeds exhibited at the 2016 and 2017 IROS autonomous drone races.

Spatiotemporal Rate Adaptive Tiled Scheme for 360 Sports Events (Tarek El-Ganainy - 13 May, 2017)
One of the main applications of virtual reality that has been recently adopted is streaming sports events. For instance, the last olympics held in Rio De Janeiro was streamed over the Internet for users to view on VR headsets or using 360 video players. A big challenge for streaming VR sports events is the users limited bandwidth and the amount of data required to transmit 360 videos. While 360 video demands high bandwidth, at any time instant users are only viewing a small portion of the video according to the HMD field of view (FOV). We conduct objective studies showing the effectiveness of our approach providing smooth degradation of quality from the user FOV to the back of the 360 space. That is, we achieve better perceived quality with huge storage savings up to 670%.

The Evolution of eSports: An Analysis of its origin and a look at its prospective future growth as enhanced by Information Technology Management tools (Anders Hval Olsen - 28 September, 2015)
As the last years have shown a massive growth within the field of electronic sports (eSports), several questions emerge, such as how much is it growing, and will it continue to grow? This research thesis sees this as its statement of problem, and further aims to define and measure the main factors that caused the growth of eSports. To further enhance the growth, the benefits and disbenefits of implementing Information Technology Management tools is appraised, which additionally gives an understanding of the future of eSports.
