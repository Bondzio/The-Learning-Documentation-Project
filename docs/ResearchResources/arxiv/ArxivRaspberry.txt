Adaptive Pruning of Neural Language Models for Mobile Devices (Raphael Tang - 26 September, 2018)
Our empirical evaluations consider both perplexity as well as energy consumption on a Raspberry Pi, where we demonstrate which methods provide the best perplexity-power consumption operating point. At one operating point, one of the techniques is able to provide energy savings of 40% over the state of the art with only a 17% relative increase in perplexity.

Towards real-time unsupervised monocular depth estimation on CPU (Matteo Poggi - 31 July, 2018)
Extensive experimental results on the KITTI dataset show that compared to the top performing approach our network has similar accuracy but a much lower complexity (about 6% of parameters) enabling to infer a depth map for a KITTI image in about 1.7 s on the Raspberry Pi 3 and at more than 8 Hz on a standard CPU. Moreover, by trading accuracy for efficiency, our network allows to infer maps at about 2 Hz and 40 Hz respectively, still being more accurate than most state-of-the-art slower methods

DeepPicar: A Low-cost Deep Neural Network-based Autonomous Car (Michael G. Bechtel - 29 July, 2018)
DeepPicar uses the same network architecture---9 layers, 27 million connections and 250K parameters---and can drive itself in real-time using a web camera and a Raspberry Pi 3 quad-core platform. Using DeepPicar, we analyze the Pi 3's computing capabilities to support end-to-end deep learning based real-time control of autonomous vehicles. We find that all tested platforms, including the Pi 3, are capable of supporting the CNN-based real-time control, from 20 Hz up to 100 Hz, depending on hardware platform. To protect the CNN workload, we also evaluate state-of-the-art cache partitioning and memory bandwidth throttling techniques on the Pi 3

Design, Configuration, Implementation, and Performance of a Simple 32 Core Raspberry Pi Cluster (Vincent A. Cicirello - 17 August, 2017)
In this report, I describe the design and implementation of an inexpensive, eight node, 32 core, cluster of raspberry pi single board computers, as well as the performance of this cluster on two computational tasks, one that requires significant data transfer relative to computational time requirements, and one that does not. Our preliminary results show that the slow 100 Mbps networking of the raspberry pi significantly limits such clusters to parallel computational tasks that are either long running relative to data communications requirements, or that which requires very little internode communications. Additionally, although the raspberry pi 3 has a quad-core processor, parallel speedup degrades during attempts to utilize all four cores of all cluster nodes for a parallel computation, likely due to resource contention with operating system level processes
