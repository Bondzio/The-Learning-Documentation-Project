Splitting source code identifiers using Bidirectional LSTM Recurrent Neural Network (Vadim Markovtsev - 19 July, 2018)
Such multi-part identifiers count for 97% of all naming tokens in the Public Git Archive - the largest dataset of Git repositories to date. We trained that network on 41.7 million distinct splittable identifiers collected from 182,014 open source projects in Public Git Archive, and show that it outperforms several other machine learning models

RefDiff: Detecting Refactorings in Version Histories (Danilo Silva - 5 April, 2017)
In this paper, we present RefDiff, an automated approach that identifies refactorings performed between two code revisions in a git repository. RefDiff employs a combination of heuristics based on static analysis and code similarity to detect 13 well-known refactoring types. In an evaluation using an oracle of 448 known refactoring operations, distributed across seven Java projects, our approach achieved precision of 100% and recall of 88%

Predicting the Popularity of GitHub Repositories (Hudson Borges - 14 July, 2016)
Finally, we evaluate the ability to predict not the number of stars of a repository but its rank among the GitHub repositories. We found a very strong correlation between predicted and real rankings (Spearman's rho greater than 0.95).

Git Loss for Deep Face Recognition (Alessandro Calefati - 28 July, 2018)
We perform experiments on two popular face recognition benchmarks datasets and show that our proposed loss function achieves maximum separability between deep face features of different identities and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on two major face recognition benchmark datasets: Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) and YouTube Faces (YTF). However, it should be noted that the major objective of Git loss is to achieve maximum separability between deep features of divergent identities.

UStore: A Distributed Storage With Rich Semantics (Anh Dinh - 9 February, 2017)
It is built around a data-structure similar to that of Git, a popular source code versioning system, but it also synthesizes many designs from distributed systems and databases.
