Internet Protocol Version 6: Dead or Alive? (Sumit Maheshwari - 17 August, 2018)
In April 2017, all Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) confirmed that IPv4 addresses are exhausted and cannot be allocated anymore implying any new organization requesting a block of Internet addresses will be allocated IPv6. Currently, when IPv4 is not available, and IPv6 is not adopted for around 20 years, the question arises whether IPv6 will still be accepted by the computer society or will it have an end of life soon with alternate better protocol such as ID based networks taking its place

OCT segmentation: Integrating open parametric contour model of the retinal layers and shape constraint to the Mumford-Shah functional (Jinming Duan - 8 August, 2018)
Regional information in each narrowband can thus be integrated into the MS energy functional such that its optimisation is robust against different initialisations. Experimental results on real OCT images demonstrate that the method is accurate and robust to low quality OCT images with low contrast and high-level speckle noise, and it outperforms the recent geodesic distance based method for segmenting 9 layers of the retina in OCT images.

Data-driven Probabilistic Atlases Capture Whole-brain Individual Variation (Yuankai Huo - 6 June, 2018)
Regional structural atlases and corresponding regional probabilistic atlases are used as indices and targets in the dictionary. The novelties of this approach are (1) it provides a new perspective of generating personal specific whole brain probabilistic atlases (132 regions) under data-driven scheme across sites. (2) The framework employs the large amount of heterogeneous data (2349 images). Importantly, the advantage the large-scale scheme is demonstrated by the better performance of using large-scale training data (1888 images) than smaller training set (720 images).

Fast Integral Histogram Computations on GPU for Real-Time Video Analytics (Mahdieh Poostchi - 6 November, 2017)
Integral histograms provide an efficient computational framework for extracting multi-scale histogram-based regional descriptors in constant time which are considered as the principle building blocks of many video content analytics frameworks. The tiled integral histogram using a diagonal wavefront scan has the best performance of about 300.4 frames/sec for 640 x 480 images and 32 bins with a speedup factor of about 120 using GTX Titan X graphics card compared to a single threaded sequential CPU implementation. Mapping integral histogram bins computations onto multiple GPUs enables us to process 32 giga bytes integral histogram data (of 64MB Image and 128 bins) with a frame rate of 0.73 Hz and speedup factor of 153X over single-threaded CPU implementation and the speedup of 45X over 16-threaded CPU implementation.

We randomly selected US images of 20 subjects as training data for tuning the parameters, and validated the methods based on US images of the remaining 65 subjects. The segmentation results have been quantitatively analyzed using 3 metrics, including Dice Index, Jaccard Index, and Mean Distance. Results: Experiment results demonstrated that the proposed method obtained segmentation results for bilateral kidneys of 65 subjects with average Dice index of 0.9581, Jaccard index of 0.9204, and Mean Distance of 1.7166, better than other methods under comparison (p<10-19, paired Wilcoxon rank sum tests)

Full Quantification of Left Ventricle via Deep Multitask Learning Network Respecting Intra- and Inter-Task Relatedness (Wufeng Xue - 14 June, 2017)
Full quantification, i.e., to simultaneously quantify all LV indices including two areas (cavity and myocardium), six regional wall thicknesses (RWT), three LV dimensions, and one cardiac phase, is even more challenging since the uncertain relatedness intra and inter each type of indices may hinder the learning procedure from better convergence and generalization. During the final estimation, both intra- and inter-task relatedness are modeled to enforce improvement of generalization: 1) respecting intra-task relatedness, group lasso is applied to each of the regression tasks for sparse and common feature selection and consistent prediction; 2) respecting inter-task relatedness, three phase-guided constraints are proposed to penalize violation of the temporal behavior of the obtained LV indices. Experiments on MR sequences of 145 subjects show that FullLVNet achieves high accurate prediction with our intra- and inter-task relatedness, leading to MAE of 190mm$^2$, 1.41mm, 2.68mm for average areas, RWT, dimensions and error rate of 10.4\% for the phase classification

Direct Estimation of Regional Wall Thicknesses via Residual Recurrent Neural Network (Wufeng Xue - 26 May, 2017)
No work has been devoted into direct estimation of RWT from cardiac MR images due to the diverse shapes and structures for various subjects and cardiac diseases, as well as the complex regional deformation of LV myocardium during the systole and diastole phases of the cardiac cycle. Our ResRNN comprises two paths: 1) a feed forward convolution neural network (CNN) for effective and robust CNN embedding learning of various cardiac images and preliminary estimation of RWT from each frame itself independently, and 2) a recurrent neural network (RNN) for further improving the estimation by modeling spatial and temporal dynamics of LV myocardium. Our ResRNN is capable of obtaining accurate estimation of cardiac RWT with Mean Absolute Error of 1.44mm (less than 1-pixel error) when validated on cardiac MR sequences of 145 subjects, evidencing its great potential in clinical cardiac function assessment.

Deep Neural Networks for Anatomical Brain Segmentation (Alexandre de Brebisson - 25 June, 2015)
The inputs of the network capture information at different scales around the voxel of interest: 3D and orthogonal 2D intensity patches capture the local spatial context while large, compressed 2D orthogonal patches and distances to the regional centroids enforce global spatial consistency. To benchmark our model, we used the dataset provided for the MICCAI 2012 challenge on multi-atlas labelling, which consists of 35 manually segmented MR images of the brain. We obtained competitive results (mean dice coefficient 0.725, error rate 0.163) showing the potential of our approach

A Three-Phase Search Approach for the Quadratic Minimum Spanning Tree Problem (Zhang-Hua Fu - 6 February, 2014)
For this problem, we propose a three-phase search approach named TPS, which integrates 1) a descent-based neighborhood search phase using two different move operators to reach a local optimum from a given starting solution, 2) a local optima exploring phase to discover nearby local optima within a given regional search area, and 3) a perturbation-based diversification phase to jump out of the current regional search area. Computational experiments based on hundreds of representative benchmarks show that TPS produces highly competitive results with respect to the best performing approaches in the literature by improving the best known results for 31 instances and matching the best known results for the remaining instances only except two cases

Globalization and Governance in Cyberspace: Mapping the Processes of Emergent Regime Formation in Global Information and Communications Policy (Derrick L. Cogburn - 23 September, 2001)
In analyzing the principles, values, norms, rules, collective decision-making prdocedures, and enforcement mechanisms of the emergent GII/GIS regime, this paper differentiates between three regime levels: (1) Macro-Regime--global; (2) Mezzo-Regime--regional and sub-regional; and (3) Micro-Regime--national. Key findings in this paper are: (1) that a range of social, political, economic, and technological factors are eroding the existing international telecommunications regime (e.g., VOIP;, call-back, VSATs, accounting rate restructuring, pressure for applicaitons development, and SMMEs); (2) a new regime for global information and communicaitons policy is emerging, but is being driven not by the broad possibilities of the Information Society, but by the more specific interests of global and multi-national corporations related to global e-commerce; (3) numerous strategic responses have been developed at national, subregional, and regional levels to the challenges of this transition in both developed and developing regions; and (4) without a collaborative response, the developing world will be further marginalized by this new regime.

Robustness of Regional Matching Scheme over Global Matching Scheme (Liang Chen - 3 May, 2000)
The paper has established and verified the theory prevailing widely among image and pattern recognition specialists that the bottom-up indirect regional matching process is the more stable and the more robust than the global matching process against concentrated types of noise represented by clutter, outlier or occlusion in the imagery. We have demonstrated this by analyzing the effect of concentrated noise on a typical decision making process of a simplified two candidate voting model where our theorem establishes the lower bounds to a critical breakdown point of election (or decision) result by the bottom-up matching process are greater than the exact bound of the global matching process implying that the former regional process is capable of accommodating a higher level of noise than the latter global process before the result of decision overturns
