Classification Algorithms for Semi-Blind Uplink/Downlink Decoupling in sub-6 GHz/mmWave 5G Networks (Hatim Chergui - 5 September, 2018)
Reliability and latency challenges in future mixed sub-6 GHz/millimeter wave (mmWave) fifth generation (5G) cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks is to guarantee a fast radio resource management in both uplink (UL) and downlink (DL), while tackling the corresponding propagation imbalance that may arise in blockage situations. In this context, we introduce a semi-blind UL/DL decoupling concept where, after its initial activation, the central processing unit (CPU) gathers measurements of the Rician $K$-factor---reflecting the line-of-sight (LOS) condition of the user equipment (UE)---as well as the DL reference signal receive power (RSRP) for both 2.6 GHz and 28 GHz frequency bands, and then train a non-linear support vector machine (SVM) algorithm. The CPU finally stops the measurements of mmWave definitely, and apply the trained SVM algorithm on the 2.6 GHz data to blindly predict the target frequencies and access points (APs) that can be independently used for the UL and DL. The accuracy score of the proposed classifier reaches $95\%$ for few training samples.

5G wireless networks are expected to support Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) traffic which requires very low packet delays ( < 1 msec.) and extremely high reliability ($\sim$99.999\%). Using a queuing network based model for the wireless system we characterize the effect of various design choices on the maximum URLLC load it can support, including: 1) system parameters such as the bandwidth, link SINR , and QoS requirements; 2) resource allocation schemes in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) based systems; and 3) Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) schemes. Key contributions of this paper which are of practical interest are: 1) study of how the the minimum required system bandwidth to support a given URLLC load scales with associated QoS constraints; 2) characterization of optimal OFDMA resource allocation schemes which maximize the admissible URLLC load; and 3) optimization of a repetition code based HARQ scheme which approximates Chase HARQ combining.

Angular and Temporal Correlation of V2X Channels Across Sub-6 GHz and mmWave Bands (Chethan Kumar Anjinappa - 6 April, 2018)
5G millimeter wave (mmWave) technology is envisioned to be an integral part of next-generation vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks and autonomous vehicles due to its broad bandwidth, wide field of view sensing, and precise localization capabilities. In this paper, we use ray tracing simulations to characterize the angular and temporal correlation across a wide range of propagation frequencies for V2X channels ranging from 900 MHz up to 73 GHz, for a vehicle maintaining line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS (NLOS) beams with a transmitter in an urban environment. Our results shed light on increasing sparsity behavior of propagation channels with increasing frequency and highlight the strong temporal/angular correlation among 5.9 GHz and 28 GHz bands especially for LOS channels.

Performance Comparison of 112 Gb/s DMT, Nyquist PAM4 and Partial-Response PAM4 for Future 5G Ethernet-based Fronthaul Architecture (Nicklas Eiselt - 31 January, 2018)
For a future 5G Ethernet-based fronthaul architecture, 100G trunk lines of a transmission distance up to 10 km standard single mode fiber (SSMF) in combination with cheap grey optics to daisy chain cell site network interfaces are a promising cost- and power-efficient solution. For such a scenario, different intensity modulation and direct detect (IMDD) Formats at a data rate of 112 Gb/s, namely Nyquist four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM4), discrete multi-tone Transmission (DMT) and partial-response (PR) PAM4 are experimentally investigated, using a low-cost electro-absorption modulated laser (EML), a 25G driver and current state-of-the-art high Speed 84 GS/s CMOS digital-to-analog converter (DAC) and analog-to-digital converter (ADC) test chips. We show the necessity for at least 11 FFE-taps for pre-emphasis and up to 41 FFE coefficients at the receiver side. On the contrary, bit- and power-loading (BL, PL) is crucial for DMT and an FFT length of at least 512 is necessary. With optimized parameters, all Modulation formats result in a very similar performances, demonstrating a transmission distance of up to 10 km over SSMF with bit error rates (BERs) below a FEC threshold of 4.4E-3, allowing error free transmission.

2004 TT357: A potential contact binary in the Trans-Neptunian belt (Audrey Thirouin - 31 July, 2017)
If it is in hydrostatic equilibrium, we find that the lightcurve can be explained by a system with a mass ratio q$_{min}$=0.45$\pm$0.05, and a density of $Ï_{min}$=2g cm$^{-3}$, or less likely a system with q$_{max}$=0.8$\pm$0.05, and $Ï_{max}$=5g cm$^{-3}$. Considering a single triaxial ellipsoid in hydrostatic equilibrium, we derive a lower limit to the density of 0.78g cm$^{-3}$, and an elongation (a/b) of 2.01 assuming an equatorial view. From Hubble Space Telescope data, we report no resolved companion orbiting 2004 TT$_{357}$. Despite an expected high fraction of contact binaries in the trans-Neptunian belt, 2001 QG$_{298}$ is the unique confirmed contact binary in the trans-Neptunian belt, and 2004 TT$_{357}$ is only the second candidate to this class of systems, with 2003 SQ$_{317}$.

Small-Scale, Local Area, and Transitional Millimeter Wave Propagation for 5G Communications (Theodore S. Rappaport - 15 August, 2017)
This paper studies radio propagation mechanisms that impact handoffs, air interface design, beam steering, and MIMO for 5G mobile communication systems. Knife edge diffraction (KED) and a creeping wave linear model are shown to predict diffraction loss around typical building objects from 10 to 26 GHz, and human blockage measurements at 73 GHz are shown to fit a double knife-edge diffraction (DKED) model which incorporates antenna gains. Small-scale spatial autocorrelations of received voltage amplitudes are shown to fit sinusoidal exponential and exponential functions for LOS and NLOS environments, respectively, with small decorrelation distances of 0.27 cm to 13.6 cm (smaller than the size of a handset) that are favorable for spatial multiplexing. Wideband mmWave power levels are shown to fade from 0.4 dB/ms to 40 dB/s, depending on travel speed and surroundings.

Indoor 5G 3GPP-like Channel Models for Office and Shopping Mall Environments (Katsuyuki Haneda - 13 March, 2016)
To meet these service demands the telecommunications industry is converging on a common set of 5G requirements which includes network speeds as high as 10 Gbps, cell edge rate greater than 100 Mbps, and latency of less than 1 msec. To reach these 5G requirements the industry is looking at new spectrum bands in the range up to 100 GHz where there is spectrum availability for wide bandwidth channels. For the development of new 5G systems to operate in bands up to 100 GHz there is a need for accurate radio propagation models which are not addressed by existing channel models developed for bands below 6 GHz.

Calculation of HELAS amplitudes for QCD processes using graphics processing unit (GPU) (K. Hagiwara - 28 September, 2009)
Because of the proliferation of the number of Feynman diagrams and the number of independent color amplitudes, the maximum number of final state jets we can evaluate on a GPU is limited to 4 for pure gluon processes ($gg\to 4g$), or 5 for processes with one or more quark lines such as $q\bar{q}\to 5g$ and $qq\to qq+3g$. Compared with the usual CPU-based programs, we obtain 60-100 times better performance on the GPU, except for 5-jet production processes and the $gg\to 4g$ processes for which the GPU gain over the CPU is about 20.

Octupole Ordering Model for the Phase IV of CexLa1-xB6 (Katsunori Kubo - 12 November, 2003)

The octupole model also accounts for the cusp in the magnetization as in the NÃ©el transition, and the softening of the elastic constant C_{44} below the ordering temperature
