An Information Theoretic Approach to Sample Acquisition and Perception in Planetary Robotics (Garrett Fleetwood - 14 September, 2017)
Obtaining and analyzing rock samples can provide unprecedented insight into the geology, geo-history and prospects for finding past life and water. The approach shows robustness to simulated sensor noise of up to 20%

Using Feature Grouping as a Stochastic Regularizer for High-Dimensional Noisy Data (Sergul Aydore - 31 July, 2018)
Such situations are common when data collection is expensive, as in neuroscience, biology, or geology

Understanding AI Data Repositories with Automatic Query Generation (Erik Altman - 20 April, 2018)
By removing humans from the main learning loop, our approach also allows more effective scaling of AI and cognitive capabilities to provide (1) broader coverage in a single domain such as health or geology; and (2) more rapid deployment to new domains

Network of Nano-Landers for In-Situ Characterization of Asteroid Impact Studies (Himangshu Kalita - 8 September, 2017)
A full-scale, artificial impact experiment onto an asteroid can help characterize its composition and geology and help in the development of asteroid deflection techniques intended for planetary defence

An Overview of Data Mining Applications in Oil and Gas Exploration: Structural Geology and Reservoir Property-Issues (Hamed Nikhalat Jahromi - 12 May, 2017)
There are two major categories of geoscientific problems in which data mining is applied: structural geology and reservoir property-issues

Project G.N.O.S.I.S.: Geographical Network Of Synoptic Information System (Pietro Oliva - 3 November, 2012)
This doesn't mean we simply aim to add history to Google Earth (though it could be already a nice goal): the main idea behind GNOSIS project is to produce applications to "dress up" the Globe with a set of skin-maps representing the most various different kind of histories like the evolution of geology, genetics, agriculture, ethnology, linguistics, musicology, metallurgy and so forth, in time

Using Evolution Strategy with Meta-models for Well Placement Optimization (Zyed Bouzarkouna - 24 November, 2010)
Considering complex reservoir geology and high reservoir heterogeneities, stochastic optimization methods are the most suitable approaches for optimum well placement

Extremal Optimization: an Evolutionary Local-Search Algorithm (Stefan Boettcher - 26 September, 2002)
Drawing upon models used to simulate the dynamics of granular media, evolution, or geology, extremal optimization complements approximation methods inspired by equilibrium statistical physics, such as {\em simulated annealing}
