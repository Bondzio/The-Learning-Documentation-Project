Seven Problems with the Claims Related to the Hubble Tension in arXiv:1810.02595 (Adam G. Riess - 8 October, 2018)
(2018) arXiv:1810.02595 make two claims that they argue bring the local measurement and early Universe prediction of H0 into agreement: A) they claim that Gaia DR2 parallax measurements show the geometric calibration of the Cepheid distance scale used to measure H0 to be grossly in error and B) that we live near the middle of an enormous void, further biasing the local measurement of the Hubble constant. We show that the first claim is caused by five erroneous uses of the data: in decreasing order of importance: 1) the use of a distance indicator, main sequence fitting of cluster stars, which is unrelated to the calibration of Cepheids and therefore has no bearing on current measurements of H0; 2) the use of Gaia data for Cepheids that fully saturate the detector, producing unreliable parallaxes; 3) the use of a fixed parallax offset which is known to depend on source magnitude and color but which is derived for sources with extremely different colors and magnitudes; 4) ignoring the uncertainty in this offset; and 5) ignoring the other geometric sources of Cepheid calibration, the distance of the LMC from detached eclipsing binaries and the masers in NGC 4258, which are independent of Milky Way parallaxes. The second claim can be refuted 6) because of the increase in chi-squared that the alleged void would entail in SN measurements in the Hubble flow, and 7) because it would represent a 6 sigma fluctuation of cosmic variance between the local and globally measured expansion, requiring us to live in an exceedingly special location.

Pressure-Induced Metal-Insulator Transition in Twisted Bi-layer Graphene (Bikash Padhi - 1 October, 2018)
Recent experiments [arXiv: 1808.07865] on twisted bilayer graphene (TBLG) show that under hydrostatic pressure, an insulating state at quarter-filling of the moirÃ© superlattice (i.e., one charge per supercell) emerges, in sharp contrast with the previous ambient pressure measurements of Cao et al. where the quarter--filling state (QFS) is a metal [Nature 556, 43 & 80 (2018)]. Theoretically, we find a peak for crystallization around $1.5$ GPa relative to the experimental optimal pressure of $1.33$ GPa for the observation of the insulating states

Limit on graviton mass using stacked galaxy cluster catalogs from SPT-SZ, Planck-SZ and SDSS-redMaPPer (Sajal Gupta - 29 September, 2018)
In this work, we apply the method proposed in Rana et al.(arXiv:1801.03309), which consists of looking for Yukawa-like fall off in the gravitational potential, to stacked galaxy cluster catalogs from three disparate surveys. These include catalogs from 2500 sq. The 90\% c.l. limits which we obtained on the graviton mass using SPT, Planck and SDSS are: $m_g < 4.73 \times 10^{-30}$ eV, $3.0 \times 10^{-30}$ eV, and $1.27 \times 10^{-30}$ eV respectively; or in terms of Compton wavelength are $Î»_g >2.62 \times 10^{20}$ km, $4.12 \times 10^{20}$ km, $9.76 \times 10^{20}$ km

Almost optimal algorithms for diameter-optimally augmenting trees (Davide BilÃ² - 2 October, 2018)
Previously, the problem was solved in $O(n^2 \log^3 n)$ time for general weights [Oh and Ahn, ISAAC 2016], in $O(n^2 \log n)$ time for trees embedded in a metric space [GroÃe et al., {\tt arXiv:1607.05547}], and in $O(n \log n)$ time for paths embedded in a metric space [Wang, WADS 2017]. Furthermore, a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm running in $O(n+1/\varepsilon^{3})$ has been designed for paths embedded in $\mathbb{R}^d$, for constant values of $d$ [GroÃe et al., ICALP 2015].

On the large R-charge $\mathcal N=2$ chiral correlators and the Toda equation (Matteo Beccaria - 2 October, 2018)
We consider $\mathcal N=2$ $SU(N)$ SQCD in four dimensions and a weak-coupling regime with large R-charge recently discussed in arXiv:1803.00580. If $\varphi$ denotes the adjoint scalar in the $\mathcal N=2$ vector multiplet, it has been shown that the 2-point functions in the sector of chiral primaries $(\text{Tr} \varphi^2)^n$ admit a finite limit when $g_\text{YM}\to 0$ with large R-charge growing like $\sim 1/g^2_\text{YM}$. This allows to determine $F(Î»; N)$ at order $O(Î»^{10})$ for generic $N$, greatly extending previous results and placing on a firmer ground a conjecture proposed for the $SU(2)$ case

Weak solutions to the Navier-Stokes inequality with arbitrary energy profiles (Wojciech S. OÅ¼aÅski - 10 September, 2018)
In a recent paper, Buckmaster & Vicol (arXiv:1709.10033) used the method of convex integration to construct weak solutions $u$ to the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations such that $\| u(t) \|_{L^2} =e(t)$ for a given non-negative and smooth energy profile $e: [0,T]\to \mathbb{R}$. Given $T>0$ and a nonincreasing energy profile $e\colon [0,T] \to [0,\infty )$ we construct weak solution to the Navier-Stokes inequality that are localised in space and whose energy profile $\| u(t)\|_{L^2 (\mathbb{R}^3 )}$ stays arbitrarily close to $e(t)$ for all $t\in [0,T]$.

Tau-functions Ã  la DubÃ©dat and probabilities of cylindrical events for double-dimers and CLE(4) (Mikhail Basok - 3 September, 2018)
Building upon recent results of DubÃ©dat (see arXiv:1403.6076) on the convergence of topological correlators in the double-dimer model considered on Temperleyan approximations $Î©^Î´$ to a simply connected domain $Î©\subset\mathbb C$ we prove the convergence of probabilities of cylindrical events for the \emph{double-dimer loop ensembles} on $Î©^Î´$ as $Î´\to 0$. We show that the probabilities $P_L^Î´$ that one obtains $L$ after withdrawing all loops surrounding no more than one puncture from a double-dimer loop ensemble on $Î©^Î´$ converge to a conformally invariant limit $P_L$ as $Î´\to 0$, for each $L$.

Neutron Dark Matter Decays and Correlation Coefficients of Neutron Beta Decays (A. N. Ivanov - 6 September, 2018)
As we have pointed out in (arXiv:1806.10107 [hep-ph]), the existence of neutron dark matter decay modes "n -> chi + anything", where "chi" is a dark matter fermion, for the solution of the neutron lifetime problem changes priorities and demands to describe the neutron lifetime "tau_n = 888.0(2.0)s", measured in beam experiments and defined by the decay modes "n -> p + anything", in the Standard Model (SM). The latter requires the axial coupling constant "lambda" to be equal to "lambda = - 1.2690" (arXiv:1806.10107 [hep-ph]). Since such an axial coupling constant is excluded by experimental data reported by the PERKEO II and UCNA Collaborations, the neutron lifetime "tau_n = 888.0(2.0)s" can be explained only by virtue of interactions beyond the SM, namely, by the Fierz interference term of order "b ~ - 10^{-2}" dependent on scalar and tensor coupling constants. We give a complete analysis of all correlation coefficients of the neutron beta decays with polarized neutron, taking into account the contributions of scalar and tensor interactions beyond the SM with the Fierz interference term "b ~ - 10^{-2}"

We consider Type IIB 5-brane configurations for 5d rank 2 superconformal theories which are classified recently by geometry in arXiv:1801.04036. We propose all the 5-brane web diagrams for these rank 2 theories and show dualities between some of different gauge theories with explicit duality map of mass parameters and Coulomb branch moduli. We also present 5-brane webs for $SU(3)$ theories of Chern-Simons level greater than 5.

Geometrical Properties of the Mean-Median Map (Jonathan Hoseana - 26 June, 2018)
By constructing a simpler map which represents the dynamics in such neighbourhoods, we extend the results of Cellarosi and Munday (arXiv:1408.3454v1 [math.CO]) by two orders of magnitude. Based on these computations, we conjecture that the Hausdorff dimension of the graph of the limit function of the multiset $[0,x,1]$ is greater than 1.

Fully Dynamic Maximal Independent Set with Sublinear in n Update Time (Sepehr Assadi - 26 June, 2018)

Moreover, they provided some partial (conditional) hardness results hinting that update time of $m^{1/2-Îµ}$, and in particular $n^{1-Îµ}$ for $n$-vertex dense graphs, is a natural barrier for this problem for any constant $Îµ>0$, for both deterministic and randomized algorithms that satisfy a certain natural property.

Globally generated vector bundles with $c_1 = 5$ on $\mathbb{P}^3$ (Cristian Anghel - 29 May, 2018)
1209 (2018), also arXiv:1305.3464]. We determine, at least, the pairs of integers $(a , b)$ for which there exist globally generated vector bundles on the projective 3-space with Chern classes $c_1 = 5$, $c_2 = a$, $c_3 = b$ (except for the case $(12 , 0)$ and the complementary case $(13 , 5)$ which remain undecided), we describe the Horrocks monads of these vector bundles and we organize them into several families with irreducible bases. We use some of the results from our paper [arXiv:1502.05553] (for which we give, however, a direct self-contained proof in one of the appendices of the present paper) to reduce the problem to the classification of stable rank 3 vector bundles $F$ with $c_1(F) = -1$, $2 \leq c_2(F) \leq 4$, having the property that $F(2)$ is globally generated. Some of the constructions appearing in the present paper are used (and reproduced, for the reader's convenience) in another paper of ours [arXiv:1711.06060] in which we provide an alternative to Chang and Ran's proof of the unirationality of the moduli spaces of curves of degree at most 13 from [Invent. 76 (1984), 41--54].

The impact of the cosmic variance on $H_0$ on cosmological analyses (David Camarena - 16 July, 2018)

First, the systematic error from cosmic variance is - independently of the model - approximately $Ï_{\text{cv}}\approx 0.88$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (1.2\% $H_0^{\text{loc}}$) when considering the redshift range $0.0233 \le z \le 0.15$, which is relative to the main analysis of (arXiv:1804.10655), and $Ï_{\text{cv}}\approx 1.5$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ (2.1\% $H_0^{\text{loc}}$) when considering the wider redshift range $0.01 \le z \le 0.15$. Although $Ï_{\text{cv}}$ affects the total error budget on local $H_0$, it does not significantly alleviate the tension which remains at $\approx 3 Ï$

The allowed region is $H^{-1}([E_1, E_2])$ and the interface $\ccal$ is its boundary. In place of the Erf scaling asymptotics in a $k^{-\half} $ tube around $\ccal$ for regular interfaces, one obtains $Î´$-asymptotics in $k^{-\frac{1}{4}}$-tubes around singular points of a critical interface

Scale-invariance as the cause of the superconducting dome in the cuprates (Zhidong Leong - 5 April, 2018)
Reber et al., arXiv:1509.01611) of cuprate superconductors have inferred that the self-energy exhibits critical scaling over an extended doping regime, thereby calling into question the conventional wisdom that critical scaling exists only at isolated points. In paticular, this new state of matter, dubbed a power-law liquid, has a self-energy whose imaginary part scales as $Î£^{\prime\prime}\sim(Ï^{2}+Ï^{2}T^{2})^Î±$, with $Î±=1$ in the overdoped Fermi-liquid state and $Î±\leq0.5$ in the optimal to underdoped regime. Consequently, the Fermi velocity vanishes and the effective mass diverges for $Î±\leq\frac{1}{2}$, in agreement with earlier experimental observations

The Big Bang Was Not That Bright (Yaron Sheffer - 28 March, 2018)

This claim presents an insurmountable biophysical challenge, since even hotter bodies, such as 450 F pizzas, do not seem to be glowing in the dark. A second, more descriptive claim, that a cosmic background radiation with $T_{\rm BB}$ of 1545 K was as blinding to humans as is our own Sun, is based on the same assumption and may have to be revised.

Higgs Couplings at High Scales (Dorival Goncalves - 3 July, 2018)
Extending our recent study in arXiv:1710.02149, we first discuss threshold effects in the Higgs propagator due to the existence of new states, such as a gauge singlet scalar portal, and a possible continuum of states in a conformal limit, both of which would be difficult to discover in other traditional searches. We find that considerable deviations compared to the SM prediction in the invariant mass distribution of the $Z$-boson pair can be conceivable, and may be probed at a $2Ï$-level at the high-luminosity 14 TeV HL-LHC for a new physics scale up to $\mathcal{O}(1 {~\rm TeV})$, and at the upgraded 27 TeV HE-LHC for a scale up to $\mathcal{O}(3 {~\rm TeV})$. For a few favorable scenarios, $5Ï$-level observation may be possible at the HE-LHC for a scale of about $\mathcal{O}(1 {~\rm TeV})$.

Effective stability against superradiance of Kerr black holes with synchronised hair (Juan Carlos Degollado - 1 April, 2018)
A recent breakthrough [arXiv:1711.08464] confirmed this instability and computed the corresponding timescales for a sample of solutions. We discuss how these results and other observations support two conclusions: $1)$ starting from the Kerr limit, the increase of hair for fixed coupling $Î¼M$ (where $M$ is the BH mass) increases the timescale of the instability; $2)$ there are hairy solutions for which this timescale, for astrophysical black hole masses, is larger than the age of the Universe. The former conclusion, allows us to identify an astrophysically viable domain of such effectively stable hairy black holes, occurring, conservatively, for $MÎ¼\lesssim 0.25$

Numerical estimate of minimal active-sterile neutrino mixing for sterile neutrinos at GeV scale (Igor Krasnov - 8 October, 2018)
We extend the previous study of this subject arXiv:1312.2887 to a more general case of non-zero CP-violating phases in the neutrino sector. Thus we obtain a sensitivity needed to fully explore the seesaw type I mechanism for sterile neutrinos with masses below 2 GeV, and one undetectable sterile neutrino that is relevant for the fixed-target experiments. All these effects sum up to push the limit of experimental confirmation of sterile-active neutrino mixing by several orders of magnitude below the results of arXiv:1312.2887 from $10^{-10}$ - $10^{-11}$ down to $10^{-12}$ and even to $10^{-20}$ in parts of parameter space; nonzero CP-violating phases are responsible for that.

A two-parameter extension of the Urbanik semigroup (Christian Berg - 3 February, 2018)

We describe a product convolution semigroup Ï_c(a,b), c>0 of probability measures on the positive half-line with densities e_c(a,b) and having the moments s_n(a,b)^c. We determine the asymptotic behaviour of e_c(a,b)(t) for t\to 0 and for t\to\infty, and the latter implies the Stieltjes indeterminacy when ac>2.

Generalized Lomb-Scargle analysis of $\rm{^{90}Sr/^{90}Y}$ decay rate measurements from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (P Tejas - 2 July, 2018)

LIGO Lo(g)Normal MACHO: Primordial Black Holes survive SN lensing constraints (Juan Garcia-Bellido - 18 December, 2017)

Finally, we find that the fraction of PBH that could constitute DM today is bounded by $f_{\rm PBH} < 1.09\ (1.38)$, for JLA (Union 2.1) catalogs, and thus it is perfectly compatible with an all-PBH dark matter scenario in the LIGO band.

In the context of the readout scheme for gravitational-wave detectors, the "double balanced homodyne detection" proposed in [K.~Nakamura and M.-K.~Fujimoto, arXiv:1709.01697.] is discussed in detail. Although it has been said that the operator $\hat{b}_Î¸:=\cosÎ¸\hat{b}_{1}+\sinÎ¸\hat{b}_{2}$ can be measured through the homodyne detection in literature, we first show that the expectation value of the operator $\hat{b}_Î¸$ cannot be measured as the linear combination of the upper- and lower-sidebands from the output of the balanced homodyne detection. Here, the operators $\hat{b}_{1}$ and $\hat{b}_{2}$ are the amplitude and phase quadrature in the two-photon formulation, respectively

Dual Superconformal Symmetry of ${\cal N}=2$ Chern-Simons theory with Fundamental Matter and Non-Renormalization at Large $N$ (Karthik Inbasekar - 7 November, 2017)
In this paper, we show that tree level $2\to 2$ scattering amplitudes in 3d ${\cal N}=2$ Chern-Simons theory coupled to a fundamental chiral multiplet are dual superconformal invariant.We further show that the large $N$ all loop exact amplitude computed in arXiv:1505.06571, also has dual superconformal symmetry, which implies dual superconformal symmetry is all loop exact which is in contrast to other known highly supersymmetric examples such as ${\cal N}=4$ SYM and ABJM where the dual superconformal symmetry is in general anomalous

On the Large $R$-charge Expansion in ${\mathcal N} = 2$ Superconformal Field Theories (Simeon Hellerman - 26 December, 2017)

They unify the notion of "smooth maps from an Azumaya/matrix super smooth manifold with a fundamental module to a super smooth manifold" introduced in D(11.2), making it a complete super parallel to the setting for D-branes in the realm of algebraic geometry in D(1) (arXiv:0709.1515 [math.AG]) and D(2) (arXiv:0809.2121 [math.AG]), and in the realm of differential or $C^{\infty}$-algebraic geometry in D(11.1) and D(11.3.1).

Limit on graviton mass from galaxy cluster Abell 1689 (Shantanu Desai - 19 January, 2018)
Recently, it has been shown that one can obtain closed bound orbits for Yukawa potential (arXiv:1705.02444), thus invalidating the main \emph{ansatz} used in Goldhaber and Nieto to obtain the graviton mass bound. In order to obtain a revised estimate using galaxy clusters, we use dynamical mass models of the Abell 1689 (A1689) galaxy cluster to check their compatibility with a Yukawa gravitational potential. Our estimated bound on the graviton mass ($m_g$) is thereby given by, $m_g < 1.37 \times 10^{-29}$ eV or in terms of the graviton Compton wavelength of, $Î»_g>9.1 \times 10^{19}$ km at 90\% confidence level.

729 new measures of economic complexity (Addendum to Improving the Economic Complexity Index) (Saleh Albeaik - 9 August, 2017)
Recently we uploaded to the arxiv a paper entitled: Improving the Economic Complexity Index. There, we compared three metrics of the knowledge intensity of an economy, the original metric we published in 2009 (the Economic Complexity Index or ECI), a variation of the metric proposed in 2012, and a variation we called ECI+. It was brought to our attention that the definition of ECI+ was equivalent to the variation of the metric proposed in 2012. More importantly, we now ask: how many variations of the original ECI work? In this paper we provide a simple unifying framework to explore multiple variations of ECI, including both the original 2009 ECI and the 2012 variation. We found that a large fraction of variations have a similar predictive power, indicating that the chance of finding a variation of ECI that works, after the seminal 2009 measure, are surprisingly high. In fact, more than 28 percent of these variations have a predictive power that is within 90 percent of the maximum for any variation. These findings show that, once the idea of measuring economic complexity was out, creating a variation with a similar predictive power (like the ones proposed in 2012) was trivial (a 1 in 3 shot). Moreover, the fact that multiple variations of the 2009 ECI perform close to the maximum, tells us that no variation of ECI will have a performance that is substantially better

The sign clusters of the massless Gaussian free field percolate on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d \geqslant 3$ (and more) (Alexander Drewitz - 25 May, 2018)
We investigate the percolation phase transition for level sets of the Gaussian free field on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, with $d\geqslant 3$, and prove that the corresponding critical parameter $h_*(d)$ is strictly positive for all $d\geqslant3$, thus settling an open question from arXiv:1202.5172. In particular, this implies that the sign clusters of the Gaussian free field percolate on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, for all $d\geqslant 3$. Among other things, our construction of an infinite cluster above small, but positive level $h$ involves random interlacements at level $u>0$, a random subset of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with desirable percolative properties, introduced in arXiv:0704.2560 in a rather different context, a certain Dynkin-type isomorphism theorem relating random interlacements to the Gaussian free field, see arXiv:1111.4818, and a recent coupling from arXiv:1402.0298 of these two objects, lifted to a continuous metric graph structure over $\mathbb{Z}^d$.

On multilevel Picard numerical approximations for high-dimensional nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations and high-dimensional nonlinear backward stochastic differential equations (Weinan E - 10 August, 2017)
arXiv:1607.03295 (2017)] we proposed a family of approximation methods based on Picard approximations and multilevel Monte Carlo methods and showed under suitable regularity assumptions on the exact solution for semilinear heat equations that the computational complexity is bounded by $O( d \, Îµ^{-(4+Î´)})$ for any $Î´\in(0,\infty)$, where $d$ is the dimensionality of the problem and $Îµ\in(0,\infty)$ is the prescribed accuracy. In this paper, we test the applicability of this algorithm on a variety of $100$-dimensional nonlinear PDEs that arise in physics and finance by means of numerical simulations presenting approximation accuracy against runtime

Furthermore, a rate of convergence of the density in $L^{\infty}\left(0,T;L^{2}(\rr)\right)$ is obtained, in case when the velocity corresponds to the gradient of density at initial time.

Simulation Study of Two Measures of Integrated Information (Suresh Jois - 29 June, 2017)
Recently, Virmani and Nagaraj (arXiv:1608.08450v2 [cs.IT]) noted the similarity between Integrated Information and Compression-Complexity, and on this basis, proposed a novel measure of network complexity called Phi-Compression Complexity (Phi-C or $Î¦^C$). Their computer simulations using Boolean networks showed that $Î¦^C$ compares favorably to Giulio Tononi et al's Integrated Information measure $Î¦$ 3.0 and exhibits desirable mathematical and computational characteristics. Methods: In the present work, $Î¦^C$ was measured for two types of simulated networks: (A) Networks representing simple neuronal connectivity motifs (presented in Fig.9 of Tononi and Sporns, BMC Neuroscience 4(1), 2003); (B) random networks derived from ErdÃ¶s-R Ã©nyi G(N, p)graphs. Code for all simulations was written in Python 3.6, and the library NetworkX was used to simulate the graphs. Results and discussions summary: In simulations A, for the same set of networks, $Î¦^C$ values differ from the values of IIT 1.0 $Î¦$ in a counter-intuitive manner

Interstellar communication. II. Application to the solar gravitational lens (Michael Hippke - 18 October, 2017)
We have shown in paper I of this series (arXiv:1706.03795) that interstellar communication to nearby (pc) stars is possible at data rates of bits per second per Watt between a 1 m sized probe and a large receiving telescope (E-ELT, 39 m), when optimizing all parameters such as frequency at 300-400 nm. The best wavelength for nearby (<100 pc) interstellar communication is limited by current technology to the UV and optical band. To suppress coronal noise, an advanced coronograph is required, alternatively an occulter could be used which would require a second spacecraft in formation flight 78 km from the receiver, and ~10 m in size. A 1 m telescope in the SGL can receive data at rates comparable to a km-class "normal" telescope.

Computational explorations of the Thompson group T for the amenability problem of F (S. Haagerup - 23 September, 2018)
Using the "cyclic reduced" numbers $Ï(((C+C^2)(D+D^2+D^3))^n)$, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, and some methods from our previous paper [arXiv:1409.1486] we can obtain precise lower bounds as well as good estimates of the spectral distributions of $\frac1{12}((I+C+C^2)(I+D+D^2+D^3))^*(I+C+C^2)(I+D+D^2+D^3),$ where $Ï$ is the tracial state on the group von Neumann algebra $L(T)$. Our extensive numerical computations suggest that $$\frac1{\sqrt{12}}||(I+C+C^2)(I+D+D^2+D^3)||\approx 3.28,$$ and thus that $F$ might be non-amenable. However, we can in no way rule out that $\frac1{\sqrt{12}}||(I+C+C^2)(I+D+D^2+D^3)||=\, 2+\sqrt2$.

On faithfulness of the lifting for Hopf algebras and fusion categories (Pavel Etingof - 25 April, 2017)

This fills a gap in arXiv/math:0203060, Subsection 9.3. Finally, we show that a subcategory or quotient category of a separable multifusion category is separable (resolving an open question from arXiv/math:0203060, Subsection 9.4), and use this to show that certain classes of tensor functors between lifts of separable categories to characteristic zero can be reduced modulo $p$.

Dynamics of D-branes II. The standard action --- an analogue of the Polyakov action for (fundamental, stacked) D-branes (Chien-Hao Liu - 11 April, 2017)
With the analysis developed in D(13.1) (arXiv:1606.08529 [hep-th]) for such maps and an improved understanding of the hierarchy of various admissible conditions on the pairs $(\varphi,\nabla)$ beyond D(13.2.1) (arXiv:1611.09439 [hep-th]) and how they resolve the built-in obstruction to pull-push of covariant tensors under a map from a noncommutative manifold to a commutative manifold, we develop further in this note some covariant differential calculus needed and apply them to work out the first variation --- and hence the corresponding equations of motion for D-branes --- of the standard action and the second variation of the kinetic term for maps and the dilaton term in this action. Compared with the non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action constructed in D(13.1) along the same line, the current note brings the Nambu-Goto-string-to-Polyakov-string analogue to D-branes.

In this short note we assume that the generic fiber of $f$ is a plane curve of degree $d\ge 5$ and we prove that $q_f\le g(F)-c_f-1$. This theorem is implied for the following result on infinitesimal deformations: let $F$ a smooth plane curve of degree $d\ge 5$ and let $Î¾$ be an infinitesimal deformation of $F$ preserving the planarity of the curve

By analyzing a NR waveform with mass ratio $8$ and dimensionless spins $+0.85$ obtained with the BAM code, we conclude that the model would benefit from NR simulations specifically targeted at improving the postmerger-ringdown phenomenological fits for mass ratios $\gtrsim 8$ and spins $\gtrsim 0.8$.

Continuous and discrete one dimensional autonomous fractional ODEs (Yuanyuan Feng - 19 July, 2017)
In this paper, we study 1D autonomous fractional ODEs $D_c^Î³u=f(u), 0< Î³<1$, where $u: [0,\infty)\mapsto\mathbb{R}$ is the unknown function and $D_c^Î³$ is the generalized Caputo derivative introduced by Li and Liu ( arXiv:1612.05103). In particular, based on an Osgood type blow-up criteria, we find relatively sharp bounds of the blow-up time in the case $A>0, p>1$. These bounds indicate that as the memory effect becomes stronger ($Î³\to 0$), if the initial value is big, the blow-up time tends to zero while if the initial value is small, the blow-up time tends to infinity. In the case $A<0, p>1$, we show that the solution decays to zero more slowly compared with the usual derivative

A charged anisotropic well-behaved Adler-Finch-Skea solution Satisfying Karmarkar Condition (Piyali Bhar - 9 May, 2017)
(arXiv:1607.05582v1) with $n=2$. Due to the inclusion of electric charged the solution leads to a very stiff equation of state (EoS) with the velocity of sound at the center $v_{r0}^2=0.819, ~v_{t0}^2=0.923$ and the compactness parameter $u=0.823$ is closed to the Buchdahl limit 0.889. This stiff EoS support a compact star configuration of mass $5.418M_\odot$ and radius of $10.1 km$.

On induced action for conformal higher spins in curved background (M. Beccaria - 24 October, 2017)
We continue the investigation of the structure of the action for a tower of conformal higher spin fields in non-trivial 4d background metric recently discussed in arXiv:1609.09381. We analyse in detail the dependence of the quadratic part of the induced action on the spin 1 and spin 3 fields, determining the presence of a curvature-dependent mixed spin 1 - spin 3 term. One consequence is that the pure spin 3 kinetic term cannot be gauge-invariant on its own beyond the leading term in small curvature expansion

Mass-deformed ABJM Theory and LLM Geometries: Exact Holography (Dongmin Jang - 16 March, 2017)

We test the gauge/gravity duality between the ${\cal N} = 6$ mass-deformed ABJM theory with U$_k(N)\times$U$_{-k}(N)$ gauge symmetry and the 11-dimensional supergravity on LLM geometries with SO(4)/${\mathbb Z}_k$ $\times$SO(4)/${\mathbb Z}_k$ isometry, in the large $N$ limit. We focus on the chiral primary operator with conformal dimension $Î= 1$. We extend our results to the case of $k\ne 1$ for LLM geometries represented by rectangular-shaped Young-diagrams. In analogy with the Coulomb branch of the ${\cal N} = 4$ super Yang-Mills theory, we argue that the discrete Higgs vacua of the mABJM theory as well as the corresponding LLM geometries are parametrized by the vevs of the chiral primary operators.

LHC signals for Singlet Neutrinos from a Natural Warped Seesaw (I) (Kaustubh Agashe - 14 December, 2016)
Recently, it was shown in arXiv:1512.06742 that a straightforward implementation of the type I seesaw mechanism in a warped extra dimensional framework is in reality a {\em natural} realization of "inverse" seesaw, i.e., the Standard Model (SM) neutrino mass is dominantly generated by exchange of pseudo-Dirac {\em TeV}-mass SM singlet neutrinos. For a benchmark scenario with $W^{ \pm }_R$ of mass 2 TeV and singlet neutrino of mass 750 GeV, we find that, in both the di-lepton + di-jet + Higgs and tri-lepton + Higgs channels, significant evidence can be seen at the LHC14 for an integrated luminosity of 300/fb and that even discovery is possible with slightly more luminosity.

Response to Comment on 'Perceptual Learning Incepted by Decoded fMRI Neurofeedback Without Stimulus Presentation'; How can a decoded neurofeedback method (DecNef) lead to successful reinforcement and visual perceptual learning? (Kazuhisa Shibata - 13 December, 2016)
Huang (arXiv:1612.03270) argues that the perceptual learning induced by our decoded neurofeedback method (DecNef) can be explained by Hebbian synaptic plasticity of connections between V1/V2 and V3/V4 rather than that within V1/V2, and that reinforcement learning at a cellular level should not be possible, and thus challenges our conclusions. These and other results indicate that learning to induce a stimulus-associated template voxel pattern in V1/V2 within as few as 100 trials is likely to be accomplished by hyper-resolution and sub-voxel level control by DecNef.

Combining this with results from arXiv:1508.07523 [math.NT] we proved that the space $K$, consisting of those odd mod~2 modular forms of level $Î_{0}(3)$ that are annihilated by the operator $U_{3}+I$, has a basis $m_{i,j}$ "adapted to $T_{7}$ and $T_{13}$" in the sense of Nicolas and Serre.

Explicit (Polynomial!) Expressions for the Expectation, Variance and Higher Moments of the Size of a (2n + 1, 2n + 3)-core partition with Distinct Parts (Anthony Zaleski - 9 December, 2016)
Inspired by Armin Straub's conjecture (arXiv:1601.07161) about the number and maximal size of (2n+1, 2n+3)-core partitions with distinct parts, we develop relatively efficient, symbolic-computational algorithms, based on non-linear functional recurrences, to generate the generating functions, according to size, of the set of such partitions. By computing these polynomials for n=1,...21, we are able to rigorously derive explicit expressions for the expectation, variance, and third through seventh moments of the random variable "size of a (2n+1, 2n+3)-core partition with distinct parts." In particular, we find that this random variable is not asymptotically normal as n goes to infinity.

Constraining alternative theories of gravity using GW$150914$ and GW$151226$ (Mariafelicia De Laurentis - 16 November, 2016)
The recently reported gravitational wave events GW$150914$ and GW$151226$ caused by the mergers of binary black holes [arXiv:1602.03841],[arXiv:1606.04855],[arXiv:1606.04856] provide a formidable way to set constraints on alternative metric theories of gravity in the strong field regime. Comparison of the observed phase of the GW$150914$ and GW$151226$ with the modulated phase in alternative theories of gravity does not give reasonable constraints due the large uncertainties in the estimated parameters for the coalescing black holes

Non-Markovian Closure Models for Large Eddy Simulations using the Mori-Zwanzig Formalism (Eric J. Parish - 23 January, 2017)

Dynamical rigidity of non discrete representations in PSL(2,R) (Maxime Wolff - 26 October, 2016)
The aim of this note is to advertise on a result, not stated explicitly, but proved, in arXiv:0802.0512. Namely, if $Î$ is any group, if $Ï_1$, $Ï_2$ are representations of $Î$ in $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$, one of them being non elementary and non discrete, and if for all $Î³\inÎ$, $Ï_1(Î³)$ and $Ï_2(Î³)$ have the same rotation number, then $Ï_1$ and $Ï_2$ are conjugate in $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$. In particular, if two non discrete, non elementary representations yield semi-conjugate actions on the circle, then they are conjugate in $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$.

Percolative properties of Brownian interlacements and its vacant set (Xinyi Li - 26 October, 2016)
In this article we investigate the percolative properties of Brownian interlacements, a model introduced by Alain-Sol Sznitman in arXiv:1209.4531, and show that: the interlacement set is "well-connected", i.e., any two "sausages" in $d$-dimensional Brownian interlacements, $d\geq 3$, can be connected via no more than $\lceil (d-4)/2 \rceil$ intermediate sausages almost surely; while the vacant set undergoes a non-trivial percolation phase transition when the level parameter varies.

Complexity of Formation in Holography (Shira Chapman - 16 November, 2016)
We apply this complexity=action duality to evaluate the `complexity of formation' (arXiv:1509.07876, arXiv:1512.04993), i.e., the additional complexity arising in preparing the entangled thermofield double state with two copies of the boundary CFT compared to preparing the individual vacuum states of the two copies. We find that for boundary dimensions $d>2$, the difference in the complexities grows linearly with the thermal entropy at high temperatures
