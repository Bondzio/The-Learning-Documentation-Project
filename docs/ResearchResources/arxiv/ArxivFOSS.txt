Experiences in Implementing an ICT-Augmented Reality as an Immersive Learning System for a Philippine HEI (Nestor R. Valdez - 24 June, 2015)
Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) systems were used, such as the OpenSimulator and various 3D renderers, to create a replica of the TUP-T campus in a simulated 3D world. With the current LAN setup in TUP-T, the optimal number of concurrent users that can be accommodated without sacrificing connectivity and the quality of virtual experience was found to be at 30 users, exactly the mean class size in TUP-T

Markov chains with heavy-tailed increments and asymptotically zero drift (Nicholas Georgiou - 19 June, 2018)
On $\mathbb{R}$ we classify whether transience is directional or oscillatory, and extend an example of Rogozin \& Foss to a class of transient martingales which oscillate between $\pm \infty$

Analyticity of the growth rate of the longest path in Barak-ErdÅs graphs (Bastien Mallein - 28 December, 2017)
In this article, we prove that for any probability distribution $Î¼$ on $\mathbb{N}$ one can construct a stationary version of the infinite-bin model --an interacting particle system introduced by Foss and Konstantopoulos-- with move distribution $Î¼$

Adoption of free and open source software using alternative educational framework in college of applied sciences (Raya Al-Hajri - 19 February, 2017)
In this research paper, the alternative educational framework has been used to identify the FOSS tools and software by considering the various strategic areas, polices and phased approach to identify the suitable FOSS tools for the courses of various specializations of Information Technology programme in College of Applied Sciences, Sultanate of Oman. As a result of this research, a list of alternative FOSS tools and software for the courses of IT programme has been identified and recommended.

Coupling any number of balls in the infinite-bin model (Ksenia Chernysh - 5 July, 2016)
The infinite-bin model, introduced by Foss and Konstantopoulos, describes the Markovian evolution of configurations of balls placed inside bins, obeying certain transition rules. This coupling makes it possible to define the regeneration events needed by Foss and Zachary to prove convergence results for the distribution of the balls.

High Order Structure Descriptors for Scene Images (Wenya Zhu - 14 October, 2014)
In this paper, third order structure statistics (TOSS) and fourth order structure statistics (FOSS) are exploited to encode higher order structure information. Afterwards, based on the radial and normal slice of TOSS and FOSS, we propose the high order structure feature: third order structure feature (TOSF) and fourth order structure feature (FOSF)

On the origin and universality of dislocation creation and void nucleation in FCC ductile metals (Wei-Wei Pang - 7 May, 2013)
We show that the dislocations are created through three distinguished stages: (i) Flattened octahedral structures (FOSs) are randomly activated by thermal fluctuations; (ii) The double-layer defect clusters are formed by self-organized stacking of FOSs on the close-packed plane; (iii) The stacking faults surrounded by the Shockley partial dislocations are created from the double-layer defect cluster due to the relative slip of internal atoms

Free and Open-Source Software is not an Emerging Property but Rather the Result of Studied Design (Paolo Magrassi - 27 December, 2010)
The development of a less than trivial piece of software, irrespective of whether it be FOSS or proprietary, is a complex cooperative effort requiring the participation of many (often thousands of) individuals. While new and powerful forces, including FOSS, are clearly at work in the post-industrial, networked econ-omy, the currently ingenuous stage of research in the field of collective intelligence and networked cooperation must give way to a deeper level of consciousness, which requires an understanding of the software development process.

Expressing advanced user preferences in component installation (Ralf Treinen - 28 September, 2009)
State of the art component-based software collections - such as FOSS distributions - are made of up to dozens of thousands components, with complex inter-dependencies and conflicts. We present an architecture that allows to express advanced user preferences about package selection in FOSS distributions

Geometric Ergodicity and Perfect Simulation (Wilfrid S. Kendall - 1 October, 2004)
