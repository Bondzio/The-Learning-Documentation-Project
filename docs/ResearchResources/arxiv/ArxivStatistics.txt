An Initial Step Towards Organ Transplantation Based on GitHub Repository (Shangwen Wang - 10 October, 2018)
We analyze statistics from 12 representative GitHub projects and get the conclusion that 1) there are abundant practical organs existing in commits with add as a key word in the comments; 2) organs in this repository mainly possess four kinds of contents; 3) approximately 70% of the organs are easy-to-transplant. Implementing our transplantation strategy for different kinds of organs, we manually extract 30 organs in three different programming languages, namely Java, Python, and C, and make unit tests for them utilizing four testing tools (two for Java, one for Python, and one for C). All the 30 organs extracted by our strategy possess good performances in unit test with the highest passing rate reaching 97% and the lowest one still passing 80% and the three Java organs work well in the new system, providing three new functionalities for the host

Performance and sensitivities of home detection from mobile phone data (Maarten Vanhoof - 26 September, 2018)
Large-scale location based traces, such as mobile phone data, have been identified as a promising data source to complement or even enrich official statistics. We analyze the validity of 9 different Home Detection Algorithms (HDAs), and we assess different sources of uncertainty. Based on 225 different set-ups for the home detection of around 18 million users we discuss different measures for validation and investigate sensitivity to user choices such as HDA parameter choice and observation period restriction. Our findings show that nation-wide performance of home detection is moderate at best, with correlations to ground truth maximizing at 0.60 only

Assessing the quality of home detection from mobile phone data for official statistics (Maarten Vanhoof - 20 September, 2018)
In this paper, we focus on arguably the most important problem hindering the application of mobile phone data in official statistics: detecting home locations. We support our argument by analysing the performance of five home detection algorithms (HDAs) that have been applied to a large, French, Call Detailed Record (CDR) dataset (~18 million users, 5 months). Our results show that criteria choice in HDAs influences the detection of home locations for up to about 40% of users, that HDAs perform poorly when compared with a validation dataset (the 35Â°-gap), and that their performance is sensitive to the time period and the duration of observation

Creating a surrogate commuter network from Australian Bureau of Statistics census data (Kristopher M. Fair - 27 August, 2018)

Further, when widening the training knowledge of the classifiers by a subset of obfuscated attacks, we achieve a significant improvement of the TPR by 4.21% - 73.3%, while the FPR is deteriorated only slightly (0.1% - 1.48%). Finally, we test the capability of an obfuscations-aware classifier to detect unknown obfuscated attacks, where we achieve over 90% detection rate on average for most of the obfuscations.

The online generative training begins with zero neurons in the hidden layer, adds and updates the neurons to adapt to statistics of streaming data in a single pass unsupervised manner, resulting in a feature representation best suited to the data. We then benchmark OGD-RBM performance to other machine learning, neural network and ClassRBM techniques for credit scoring applications using 3 public non-stationary two-class credit datasets with varying degrees of class-imbalance. We report that OGD-RBM improves accuracy by 2.5-3% over batch learning techniques while requiring at least 24%-70% fewer neurons and fewer training samples

Moment-Based Quantile Sketches for Efficient High Cardinality Aggregation Queries (Edward Gan - 13 July, 2018)
This data structure, which we refer to as the moments sketch, operates with a small memory footprint (200 bytes) and computationally efficient (50ns) merges by tracking only a set of summary statistics, notably the sample moments. Empirical evaluation on real-world datasets shows that the moments sketch can achieve less than 1 percent error with 15 times less merge overhead than comparable summaries, improving end query time in the MacroBase engine by up to 7 times and the Druid engine by up to 60 times.

Online LZ77 Parsing and Matching Statistics with RLBWTs (Hideo Bannai - 13 April, 2018)
Lempel-Ziv 1977 (LZ77) parsing, matching statistics and the Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) are all fundamental elements of stringology. In a series of recent papers, Policriti and Prezza (DCC 2016 and Algorithmica, CPM 2017) showed how we can use an augmented run-length compressed BWT (RLBWT) of the reverse $T^R$ of a text $T$, to compute offline the LZ77 parse of $T$ in $O (n \log r)$ time and $O (r)$ space, where $n$ is the length of $T$ and $r$ is the number of runs in the BWT of $T^R$. Our experiments, using an extension of Ohno, Takabatake, I and Sakamoto's (IWOCA 2017) implementation of updating, show our approach is both time- and space-efficient for repetitive strings

Decision Stream: Cultivating Deep Decision Trees (Dmitry Ignatov - 3 September, 2017)

Our experimental results reveal that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the standard decision tree learning methods on both regression and classification tasks, yielding a prediction error decrease up to 35%.

Comparison of ontology alignment systems across single matching task via the McNemar's test (Majid Mohammadi - 20 April, 2018)
However,it is substantially provocative to select one measure among others for comparison.On top of that, claiming if one system has a better performance than one another cannot be substantiated solely by comparing two scalars.In this paper,we propose the statistical procedures which enable us to theoretically favor one system over one another.The McNemar's test is the statistical means by which the comparison of two ontology alignment systems over one matching task is drawn.The test applies to a 2x2 contingency table which can be constructed in two different ways based on the alignments,each of which has their own merits/pitfalls.The ways of the contingency table construction and various apposite statistics from the McNemar's test are elaborated in minute detail.In the case of having more than two alignment systems for comparison, the family-wise error rate is expected to happen. Thus, the ways of preventing such an error are also discussed.A directed graph visualizes the outcome of the McNemar's test in the presence of multiple alignment systems.From this graph, it is readily understood if one system is better than one another or if their differences are imperceptible.The proposed statistical methodologies are applied to the systems participated in the OAEI 2016 anatomy track, and also compares several well-known similarity metrics for the same matching problem.

Using Deep Learning and Google Street View to Estimate the Demographic Makeup of the US (Timnit Gebru - 2 March, 2017)
The United States spends more than $1B each year on initiatives such as the American Community Survey (ACS), a labor-intensive door-to-door study that measures statistics relating to race, gender, education, occupation, unemployment, and other demographic factors. Here, we present a method that determines socioeconomic trends from 50 million images of street scenes, gathered in 200 American cities by Google Street View cars. Data from this census of motor vehicles, which enumerated 22M automobiles in total (8% of all automobiles in the US), was used to accurately estimate income, race, education, and voting patterns, with single-precinct resolution. (The average US precinct contains approximately 1000 people.) The resulting associations are surprisingly simple and powerful. For instance, if the number of sedans encountered during a 15-minute drive through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely to vote for a Democrat during the next Presidential election (88% chance); otherwise, it is likely to vote Republican (82%)

Revealing Utilization at Internet Interconnection Points (Nick Feamster - 4 September, 2016)
One mechanism, developed by DeepField Networks, allows Internet service providers (ISPs) to gather and aggregate utilization information using network flow statistics, standardized in the Internet Engineering Task Force as IPFIX. This report (1) provides an overview of the method that DeepField Networks is using to measure the utilization of various interconnection links between content providers and ISPs or links over which traffic between content and ISPs flow; and (2) surveys the findings from five months of Internet utilization data provided by seven participating ISPs---Bright House Networks, Comcast, Cox, Mediacom, Midco, Suddenlink, and Time Warner Cable---whose access networks represent about 50% of all U.S. The dataset includes about 97% of the paid peering, settlement-free peering, and ISP-paid transit links of each of the participating ISPs. Initial analysis of the data---which comprises more than 1,000 link groups, representing the diverse and substitutable available routes---suggests that many interconnects have significant spare capacity, that this spare capacity exists both across ISPs in each region and in aggregate for any individual ISP, and that the aggregate utilization across interconnects interconnects is roughly 50% during peak periods.

Differentiated latency in data center networks with erasure coded files through traffic engineering (Yu Xiang - 17 February, 2016)
Due to limited bandwidth available at both top-of-the-rack and aggregation switches and tenants in different service classes need differentiated services, network bandwidth must be apportioned among different intra- and inter-rack data flows for different service classes in line with their traffic statistics. We develop an iterative algorithm which decouples and solves the joint optimization as 3 sub-problems, which are either convex or solvable via bipartite matching in polynomial time. The proposed algorithm is prototyped in an open-source, distributed file system, {\em Tahoe}, and evaluated on a cloud testbed with 16 separate physical hosts in an Openstack cluster using 48-port Cisco Catalyst switches

Approximating the Simplicial Depth (Peyman Afshani - 27 December, 2015)
The simplicial depth is a notion of data depth with many applications in robust statistics and computational geometry. By combining these approaches, we compute a $(1+\varepsilon)$-approximation of the simplicial depth in time $\tilde{O}(n^{d/2 + 1})$ ignoring polylogarithmic factor. Furthermore, we present a simple strategy to compute the simplicial depth exactly in $O(n^d \log n)$ time, which provides the first improvement over the trivial $O(n^{d+1})$ time algorithm for $d>4$. Finally, we show that computing the simplicial depth exactly is #P-complete and W[1]-hard if the dimension is part of the input.

For $Î±\in (1, \infty)$, the proof relies on a new Apollonius theorem for the Hellinger divergence, and for $Î±\in (0,1)$, the proof relies on the Banach-Alaoglu theorem from functional analysis. These include a projection theorem on a specific $Î±$-convex set, which is termed an {\em $Î±$-linear family}, generalizing a result by CsiszÃ¡r for $Î±\neq 1$
