A Comparative Study Between a Micromechanical Cantilever Resonator and MEMS-based Passives for Band-pass Filtering Application (J. Basu - 9 June, 2011)
Over the past few years, significant growth has been observed in using MEMS based passive components in the RF microelectronics domain, especially in transceiver components. The filters were designed to have a center frequency of 455 kHz, meant for use as the intermediate frequency (IF) filter in superheterodyne receivers

From Digital computers to quantum computers based on biological paradigms and progress in particle physics (P. N. Borza - 24 September, 2016)
While several paths have emerged in microelectronics and computing as follow-ons to Turing architectures, and have been implemented using essentially silicon circuits, very little beyond Moore research has considered: (1) first biological processes instead of sequential instructions, and, (2) the implementation of these processes exploiting particle physics interactions
