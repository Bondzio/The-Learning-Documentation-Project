Auto Analysis of Customer Feedback using CNN and GRU Network (Deepak Gupta - 12 October, 2017)
Analyzing customer feedback is the best way to channelize the data into new marketing strategies that benefit entrepreneurs as well as customers. Our model achieved the second rank in French, with an accuracy of 71.75% and third ranks for all the other languages.

Towards Characterizing International Routing Detours (Anant Shah - 16 June, 2016)
Characterizing international detours is useful to a number of players: (a) network engineers trying to diagnose persistent problems, (b) policy makers aiming at adhering to certain national communication policies, (c) entrepreneurs looking for opportunities to deploy new networks, or (d) privacy-conscious states trying to minimize the amount of internal communication traversing different jurisdictions. In this paper we characterize international detours in the Internet during the month of January 2016. To detect detours we sample BGP RIBs every 8 hours from 461 RouteViews and RIPE RIS peers spanning 30 countries. Out of all the detours, more than 90% were transient detours that lasted for 72 hours or less

The Hidden Cost of Accommodating Crowdfunder Privacy Preferences: A Randomized Field Experiment (Gordon Burtch - 18 August, 2014)
Online crowdfunding has received a great deal of attention from entrepreneurs and policymakers as a promising avenue to fostering entrepreneurship and innovation. We find that reducing access to information controls induces a net increase in fundraising, yet this outcome results from two competing influences: treatment increases willingness to engage with the platform (a 4.9% increase in the probability of contribution) and simultaneously decreases the average contribution (a $5.81 decline)

Knowledge Dispersion Index for Measuring Intellectual Capital (Vikram Dhillon - 13 June, 2011)
We discuss the implications of this index for knowledge management fields and also as intellectual capital that can thus be utilized by entrepreneurs. We present a table of about 23 metrics, such as change in IT inventory and percentage of employees with advanced degrees, that can be used at micro scales to wholly quantify knowledge dispersion as intellectual capital

From MVPs to pivots: a hypothesis-driven journey of two software startups (Dron Khanna - 16 August, 2018)
We also find that entrepreneurs do learn from testing their hypotheses. The approach we proposed visualizes the flow of entrepreneurial knowledge across pivots via MVPs.

Building an Entrepreneurship Data Warehouse (Yngve Dahle - 3 December, 2017)
Our ambition is to empirically measure if such changes of the business idea, the business model elements, the project management and close interaction with customers really increases the success rate of entrepreneurs, and in what way. This paper will focus on how to build and set up a test harness (from now on called the Entrepreneurship Platform or EP) to gather empirical data from Companies and how to store these data together with demographical and financial data from the PROFF-portal in the Entrepreneurial Data Warehouse (from now called the EDW)

Information Design in Crowdfunding under Thresholding Policies (Wen Shen - 28 March, 2018)
We introduce a heuristic algorithm to dynamically compute information-disclosure policies for the entrepreneur, followed by an empirical evaluation to demonstrate its competitiveness over the widely-adopted immediate-disclosure policy. With appropriate heuristics, an entrepreneur can benefit from dynamic information disclosure

Network-based information filtering algorithms: ranking and recommendation (Matus Medo - 22 August, 2012)
After the Internet and the World Wide Web have become popular and widely-available, the electronically stored online interactions of individuals have fast emerged as a challenge for researchers and, perhaps even faster, as a source of valuable information for entrepreneurs. For example, which other users of a social network you might want to be friend with? Which other items you might be interested to purchase? Who are the most influential users in a network? Which web page you might want to visit next? All these questions are not only interesting per se but the answers to them may help entrepreneurs provide better service to their customers and, ultimately, increase their profits.
