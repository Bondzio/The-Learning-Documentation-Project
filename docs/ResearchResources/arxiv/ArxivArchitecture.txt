Listening for Sirens: Locating and Classifying Acoustic Alarms in City Scenes (Letizia Marchegiani - 11 October, 2018)
Lastly, we use the denoised signals to localise the acoustic source on the horizon plane, by regressing the direction of arrival of the sound through a CNN architecture. Our experimental evaluation shows an average classification rate of 94%, and a median absolute error on the localisation of 7.5Â° when operating on audio frames of 0.5s, and of 2.5Â° when operating on frames of 2.5s

Inter-Scanner Harmonization of High Angular Resolution DW-MRI using Null Space Deep Learning (Vishwesh Nath - 9 October, 2018)
To use these data, we propose a new network architecture, the null space deep network (NSDN), to simultaneously learn on traditional observed/truth pairs (e.g., MRI-histology voxels) along with repeated observations without a known truth (e.g., scan-rescan MRI). NSDN significantly improved absolute performance relative to histology by 3.87% over CSD and 1.42% over a recently proposed deep neural network approach. More-over, it improved reproducibility on the paired data by 21.19% over CSD and 10.09% over a recently proposed deep approach. Finally, NSDN improved gen-eralizability of the model to a third in vivo human scanner (which was not used in training) by 16.08% over CSD and 10.41% over a recently proposed deep learn-ing approach

Deep Geodesic Learning for Segmentation and Anatomical Landmarking (Neslisah Torosdagli - 6 October, 2018)
In step 1, we propose a deep neu- ral network architecture with carefully designed regularization, and network hyper-parameters to perform image segmentation without the need for data augmentation and complex post- processing refinement. In step 2, we formulate the landmark localization problem directly on the geodesic space for sparsely- spaced anatomical landmarks. In step 3, we propose to use a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to identify closely- spaced landmarks, which is rather difficult to obtain using other standard detection networks. We used a very challenging CBCT dataset of 50 patients with a high-degree of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) variability that is realistic in clinical practice. Complementary to the quantitative analysis, the qualitative visual inspection was conducted for distinct CBCT scans from 250 patients with high anatomical variability

This architecture allows a robot to optimize autonomously hyper-parameters that need to be tuned from any action and/or vision module, treated as a black-box. As example, the system has been used to optimized 9 continuous hyper-parameters of a professional software (Kamido) both in simulation and with a real robot (industrial robotic arm Fanuc) with a total of 13 different objects. The robot is able to find a good object-specific optimization in 68 (simulation) or 40 (real) trials. Moreover, with the real robot, we show that the method consistently outperforms the manual optimization from an expert with less than 2 hours of training time to achieve more than 88% of success.

In this paper, we propose to utilize the custom instruction approach to efficiently implement the widely used Viterbi decoding algorithm by adding the assembly language instructions to the ISA of DLX, PicoJava II and NIOS II processors, which represent RISC, stack and FPGA-based soft-core processor architectures, respectively. By using the custom instruction approach, the execution time of the Viterbi algorithm is significantly improved by approximately 3 times for DLX and PicoJava II, and by 2 times for NIOS II.
