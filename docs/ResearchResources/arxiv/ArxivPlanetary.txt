SPASS: Scientific Prominence Active Search System with Deep Image Captioning Network (Dicong Qiu - 10 September, 2018)
Planetary exploration missions with Mars rovers are complicated, which generally require elaborated task planning by human experts, from the path to take to the images to capture. NASA has been using this process to acquire over 22 million images from the planet Mars

Fast Approximate Clearance Evaluation for Kinematically Constrained Articulated Suspension Systems (Kyohei Otsu - 31 July, 2018)
In this paper, we present a light-weight collision detection algorithm for motion planning of planetary rovers with articulated suspension systems. However, such expensive computation is intractable for slow spacecraft computers, such as the RAD750 that is used by the Curiosity Mars rover and upcoming Mars 2020 rover. ACE is planned to be used as part of the new onboard path planner of the Mars 2020 rover

Overcoming the Challenges of Solar Rover Autonomy: Enabling Long-Duration Planetary Navigation (Olivier Lamarre - 9 September, 2018)
The successes of previous and current Mars rovers have encouraged space agencies worldwide to pursue additional planetary exploration missions with more ambitious navigation goals. For example, NASA's planned Mars Sample Return mission will be a multi-year undertaking that will require a solar-powered rover to drive over 150 metres per sol for approximately three months

Urban Delay Tolerant Network Simulator (UDTNSim v0.1) (Sarath Babu - 17 September, 2017)
The major reasons for high delay include partial connectivity of networks as can be seen in many types of ad hoc wireless networks with frequent network partitions, long propagation time as experienced in inter-planetary and deep space networks, and frequent link disruptions due to the mobility of nodes as observed in terrestrial wireless network environments. Therefore, in this document, we present the documentation of an Urban Delay Tolerant Network Simulator (UDTNSim) version 0.1, capable of simulating urban road network environments with DTN characteristics including mobility models and routing protocols
