IMLS-SLAM: scan-to-model matching based on 3D data (Jean-Emmanuel Deschaud - 23 February, 2018)
The Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) problem has been well studied in the robotics community, especially using mono, stereo cameras or depth sensors. 3D depth sensors, such as Velodyne LiDAR, have proved in the last 10 years to be very useful to perceive the environment in autonomous driving, but few methods exist that directly use these 3D data for odometry. We show experiments with the Velodyne HDL32 with only 0.40% drift over a 4 km acquisition without any loop closure (i.e., 16 m drift after 4 km). We tested our solution on the KITTI benchmark with a Velodyne HDL64 and ranked among the best methods (against mono, stereo and LiDAR methods) with a global drift of only 0.69%.

We find that it is possible to train a real-world object detector that is accurate to $1.5$cm and robust to distractors and partial occlusions using only data from a simulator with non-realistic random textures

For applications in navigation and robotics, estimating the 3D pose of objects is as important as detection.

In this paper we build on a recent state-of-the-art convolutional network for slidingwindow detection [10] to provide detection and rough pose estimation in a single shot, without intermediate stages of detecting parts or initial bounding boxes. The resulting system is as accurate as recent work on pose estimation (42.4% 8 View mAVP on Pascal 3D+ [21] ) and significantly faster (46 frames per second (FPS) on a TITAN X GPU)

Clingo = ASP + Control: Preliminary Report (Martin Gebser - 14 May, 2014)
Among others, such processes feature advanced forms of search, as in optimization or theory solving, or even interact with an environment, as in robotics or query-answering. In fact, clingo 4 carries out such complex reasoning within a single integrated ASP grounding and solving process. clingo 4 accomplishes this by complementing ASP's declarative input language by control capacities expressed via the embedded scripting languages lua and python. On the declarative side, clingo 4 offers a new directive that allows for structuring logic programs into named and parameterizable subprograms. By strictly separating logic and control programs, clingo 4 also abolishes the need for dedicated systems for incremental and reactive reasoning, like iclingo and oclingo, respectively, and its flexibility goes well beyond the advanced yet still rigid solving processes of the latter.

Robotic Arm for Remote Surgery (Steven Dinger - 22 July, 2013)
Recent advances in telecommunications have enabled surgeons to operate remotely on patients with the use of robotics. The actuation system, or robotic arm, is based on a lead screw mechanism which can obtain a maximum speed of 0.28 m/s with a 1.5 degree/step for the end-effector. The infrared detection and encoder resolutions are below 0.6 mm/pixel and 0.4 mm respectively, which ensures the robotic arm can operate precisely. The control design results in a rise time of less than 0.5 s, a steady-state error of less than 1 mm and settling time of less than 1.4 s. The system accumulates, over an extended period of time, an error of approximately 4 mm due to inertial effects of the robotic arm

Mutual Localization: Two Camera Relative 6-DOF Pose Estimation from Reciprocal Fiducial Observation (Vikas Dhiman - 1 April, 2013)
Concurrently estimating the 6-DOF pose of multiple cameras or robots---cooperative localization---is a core problem in contemporary robotics. Our experiments demonstrate the capabilities of our proposal egomotion-free cooperative localization method: for example, the method achieves 2cm range and 0.7 degree accuracy at 2m sensing for 6-DOF pose. To demonstrate the applicability of the proposed work, we deploy our method on Turtlebots and we compare our results with ARToolKit and Bundler, over which our method achieves a 10 fold improvement in translation estimation accuracy.

Nature-Inspired Interconnects for Self-Assembled Large-Scale Network-on-Chip Designs (Christof Teuscher - 21 April, 2007)
Current NoC architectures are either highly regular or fully customized, both of which represent implausible assumptions for emerging bottom-up self-assembled molecular electronics that are generally assumed to have a high degree of irregularity and imperfection. The results confirm that (1) computation in irregular assemblies is a promising and disruptive computing paradigm for self-assembled nano-scale electronics and (2) that 3D small-world interconnect fabrics with a power-law decaying distribution of shortcut lengths are physically plausible and have major advantages over local 2D and 3D regular topologies.
