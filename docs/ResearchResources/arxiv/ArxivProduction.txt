Robust online identification of thermal models for in-production HPC clusters with machine learning-based data selection (Federico Pittino - 3 October, 2018)
However, when dealing with large scale systems "in production" the accuracy of learned thermal models depends on the dynamics of the power excitation, which depends also on the executed workload, and measurement nonidealities, such as quantization. However, we also show that: 1) not all real workloads allow for the identification of a good model; 2) starting from the theory of system identification it is very difficult to evaluate if a trace of data leads to a good estimated model. We also show that only via deep learning techniques these traces can be correctly chosen up to 96% of the times.

Assessing the quality of home detection from mobile phone data for official statistics (Maarten Vanhoof - 20 September, 2018)
However, multiple problems and uncertainties need to be solved before these data can inform, support or even become an integral part of statistical production processes. We support our argument by analysing the performance of five home detection algorithms (HDAs) that have been applied to a large, French, Call Detailed Record (CDR) dataset (~18 million users, 5 months). Our results show that criteria choice in HDAs influences the detection of home locations for up to about 40% of users, that HDAs perform poorly when compared with a validation dataset (the 35Â°-gap), and that their performance is sensitive to the time period and the duration of observation

Self-Supervised Generation of Spatial Audio for 360 Video (Pedro Morgado - 7 September, 2018)
Spatial audio is an important component of immersive 360 video viewing, but spatial audio microphones are still rare in current 360 video production. Our system consists of end-to-end trainable neural networks that separate individual sound sources and localize them on the viewing sphere, conditioned on multi-modal analysis of audio and 360 video frames. We introduce several datasets, including one filmed ourselves, and one collected in-the-wild from YouTube, consisting of 360 videos uploaded with spatial audio. Using our approach, we show that it is possible to infer the spatial location of sound sources based only on 360 video and a mono audio track.

Cross-Cultural and Cultural-Specific Production and Perception of Facial Expressions of Emotion in the Wild (Ramprakash Srinivasan - 13 August, 2018)
In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of the production and visual perception of facial expressions of emotion in the wild. We find that of the 16,384 possible facial configurations that people can theoretically produce, only 35 are successfully used to transmit emotive information across cultures, and only 8 within a smaller number of cultures. Additionally, we find that the number of expressions used to communicate each emotion is also different, e.g., 17 expressions transmit happiness, but only 1 is used to convey disgust.

Reassembling the English novel, 1789-1919 (Allen Riddell - 1 August, 2018)
Without a detailed accounting of literary production, numerous questions proved impossible to answer. This paper offers two analyses of bibliographic data concerning novels published in the British Isles after 1789. First, we estimate yearly rates of new novel publication between 1789 and 1919. Second, using titles of novels appearing between 1800 and 1829, we resolve a dispute concerning occupational gender segregation in novel subgenres. We show that the remarkable growth in the number of men novelists after 1815 was not concentrated in particular subgenres.

Large-Scale Visual Speech Recognition (Brendan Shillingford - 1 October, 2018)

The proposed system achieves a word error rate (WER) of 40.9% as measured on a held-out set. In comparison, professional lipreaders achieve either 86.4% or 92.9% WER on the same dataset when having access to additional types of contextual information. Our approach significantly improves on other lipreading approaches, including variants of LipNet and of Watch, Attend, and Spell (WAS), which are only capable of 89.8% and 76.8% WER respectively.

In contrast to step 3, the interactions of all modules and interactions with the system environment are visible then and subject to testing. Critical assessment of the above process shows that there is a considerable delay between delivery of a set of specifications to the software project team (at the end of step 3) and system-level tests based on an ECU that runs entire software (step 6)

Energy Optimization of Robotic Cells (Libor Bukata - 16 February, 2018)
This study focuses on the energy optimization of industrial robotic cells, which is essential for sustainable production in the long term. The experimental results showed that the heuristic solved 93 % of instances with a solution quality close to a proven lower bound. Moreover, compared with the existing works, which typically address problems with three to four robots, this study solved real-size problem instances with up to 12 robots and considered more optimization aspects. The outcomes, based on simulations and measurements, indicate that, compared with the previous state (at maximal robot speeds and without deeper power-saving modes), the energy consumption can be reduced by about 20 % merely by optimizing the robot speeds and applying power-saving modes

For Whom the Bell Trolls: Troll Behaviour in the Twitter Brexit Debate (Clare Llewellyn - 26 January, 2018)
In the absence of a similar list of operatives active within the debate on the 2016 UK referendum on membership of the European Union (Brexit) we investigated the behaviour of the same American Election focused accounts in the production of content related to the UK-EU referendum. We found that within our dataset we had Brexit-related content from 419 of these accounts, leading to 3,485 identified tweets gathered between the 29th August 2015 and 3rd October 2017. We also demonstrate that, while these accounts are, in general, designed to resemble American citizens, accounts created in 2016 often contained German locations and terms in the user profiles.

StressedNets: Efficient Feature Representations via Stress-induced Evolutionary Synthesis of Deep Neural Networks (Mohammad Javad Shafiee - 16 January, 2018)
Here, we further extend upon the evolutionary synthesis strategy for achieving efficient feature extraction via the introduction of a stress-induced evolutionary synthesis framework, where stress signals are imposed upon the synapses of a deep neural network during training to induce stress and steer the synthesis process towards the production of more efficient deep neural networks over successive generations and improved model fidelity at a greater efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework to synthesize StressedNets with significant improvement in network architecture efficiency (e.g., 40x for AlexNet and 33x for YOLOv2) and speed improvements (e.g., 5.5x inference speed-up for YOLOv2 on an Nvidia Tegra X1 mobile processor).

Does Quantity Make a Difference? The importance of publishing many papers (Peter van den Besselaar - 7 October, 2015)
Do highly productive researchers have significantly higher probability to produce top cited papers? Or does the increased productivity in science only result in a sea of irrelevant papers as a perverse effect of competition and the increased use of indicators for research evaluation and accountability focus? We use a Swedish author disambiguated data set consisting of 48,000 researchers and their WoS-publications during the period of 2008 2011 with citations until 2014 to investigate the relation between productivity and production of highly cited papers

To What Extent Is Stress Testing of Android TV Applications Automated in Industrial Environments? (Bo Jiang - 23 September, 2015)
We summarize the find-ings collected from 10 industrial test engineers to have tested 20 such TV applications in a real production environment. With such supports, 87% of the industrial test specifications of one TV model can be fully automated and 71.4% of them were found to be fully reusable to test a subsequent TV model with major up-grades of hardware, operating system and application. It repre-sents a significant improvement with margins of 28% and 38%, respectively, compared to stress testing without such supports.

We provide two concrete suggestions: 1) linking the application's debug state to SSL verification, and 2) pinning certificates and CAs in the manifest. We evaluate the appropriateness of these two suggestions on over 13,000 applications from Google's Play Store, of which 3,302 use SSL in non-advertisement code, and find that 1,889 (57.20%) of these SSL applications would benefit.

Short-Term Predictability of Photovoltaic Production over Italy (Matteo De Felice - 29 September, 2014)
About the 6% of electricity in Italy comes from PV and for an efficient management of the power grid an accurate and reliable forecasting of production would be needed. Starting from a dataset of electricity production of 65 Italian solar plants for the years 2011-2012 we investigate the possibility to forecast daily production from one to ten days of lead time without using on site measurements. As expected, solar power production is strongly influenced by cloudiness and clear sky, in fact we observe that while during summer we obtain a general error under the 10% (slightly lower in south Italy), during winter the error is abundantly above the 20%.

Among the 5 outlier cluster, 2 of them are genuine concern, while the other 3 figure out because of the huge number of rows involved.

Finding the Minimal DFA of Very Large Finite State Automata with an Application to Token Passing Networks (Vlad Slavici - 29 March, 2011)
Two of the most important algorithms for FSA processing are the conversion of a non-deterministic finite automaton (NFA) to a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and then the production of the unique minimal DFA for the original NFA. We exhibit a parallel disk-based algorithm that uses a cluster of 29 commodity computers to produce an intermediate DFA with almost two billion states and then continues by producing the corresponding unique minimal DFA with less than 800,000 states. The largest previous such computation in the literature was carried out on a 512-processor CM-5 supercomputer in 1996. The parallel disk-based computation is also compared with both a single-threaded and multi-threaded RAM-based implementation using a 16-core 128 GB large shared memory computer.

Quality Control and Validation Boundaries in a Triple Helix of University-Industry-Government: 'Mode 2' and the Future of University Research (Yuko Fujigaki - 8 January, 2010)
How is quality control organized in the new "Mode 2" of the production of scientific knowledge? When institutional boundaries are increasingly blurred in a Triple Helix of University-Industry-Government relations, criteria for quality control in the production of scientific knowledge can be expected to change at the interfaces. These changes were mainly specified as institutional parameters in order to deal with the subjects of R&D management and S&T policies, that is, ex ante (Spiegel-Ring 1973 Van den Daele et al. 1979). We focus on the 'validation boundaries' emerging from the differences between Mode 1 and Mode 2 that is, on the criteria for quality control that can analytically and reflexively be brought to the fore ex post

We present a model of workers supplying labor to paid crowdsourcing projects. At the median wage, the point elasticity of extensive labor supply is 0.43. Interestingly, a number of workers clearly prefer earning total amounts evenly divisible by 5, presumably because these amounts make good targets.

The results of this paper show that 1) cooperative peers share all produced content while non-cooperative peers do not share at all without an incentive scheme; 2) a cooperative scheme allows peers to consume more content than non-cooperative outcomes do; 3) a cooperative outcome can be achieved among non-cooperative peers by introducing an incentive scheme based on payment, repeated interaction, or intervention; and 4) enforced full sharing has ambiguous welfare effects on peers

Dynamic Policies for Cooperative Networked Systems (George Iosifidis - 25 July, 2017)
Under what conditions their collaboration leads to a sustainable economy? Which online policy can ensure a feasible resource exchange point will be attained, and what information is needed to implement it? Furthermore, assuming there are different resources and the entities have diverse production capabilities, which production policy each entity should employ in order to maximize the economy's sustainability? Importantly, can we design such policies that are also incentive compatible even when there is no a priori information about the entities' needs? We introduce a dynamic production scheduling and resource exchange model to capture this fundamental problem and provide answers to the above questions
