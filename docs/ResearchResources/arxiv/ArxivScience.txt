Intrusion Detection Using Mouse Dynamics (Margit Antal - 10 October, 2018)
The Balabit data set was released in 2016 for a data science competition, which against the few subjects, can be considered the first adequate publicly available one. Set of actions-based evaluation achieves 0.92 AUC on the test part of the data set. However, the same type of evaluation conducted on the training part of the data set resulted in maximal AUC (1) using only 13 actions

Is your Statement Purposeless? Predicting Computer Science Graduation Admission Acceptance based on Statement Of Purpose (Diptesh Kanojia - 9 October, 2018)
We present a quantitative, data-driven machine learning approach to mitigate the problem of unpredictability of Computer Science Graduate School Admissions. We train a model over fifty manually verified SOPs for which it uses an SVM classifier and achieves the highest accuracy of 92% with 10-fold cross-validation

Machine Learning Suites for Online Toxicity Detection (David Noever - 3 October, 2018)
To identify and classify toxic online commentary, the modern tools of data science transform raw text into key features from which either thresholding or learning algorithms can make predictions for monitoring offensive conversations. We systematically evaluate 62 classifiers representing 19 major algorithmic families against features extracted from the Jigsaw dataset of Wikipedia comments. Among 28 features of syntax, sentiment, emotion and outlier word dictionaries, a simple bad word list proves most predictive of offensive commentary.

Optimizing the Human-Machine Partnership with Zooniverse (Lucy Fortson - 25 September, 2018)
With over 120 projects built reaching nearly 1.7 million volunteers, the Zooniverse.org platform has led the way in the application of Citizen Science as a method for closing the Big Data analysis gap. Since the launch in 2007 of the Galaxy Zoo project, the Zooniverse platform has enabled significant contributions across many disciplines; e.g., in ecology, humanities, and astronomy. To cope with the larger datasets looming on the horizon such as astronomy's Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) or the 100's of TB from ecology projects annually, Zooniverse has been researching a system design that is optimized for efficiency in task assignment and incorporating human and machine classifiers into the classification engine

Aspects on Finding the Optimal Practical Programming Exercise for MOOCs (Ralf Teusner - 21 September, 2018)
Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) focus on manifold subjects, ranging from social sciences over languages to technical skills, and use different means to train the respective skills. Based on over 3 million executions and scoring runs of participants' task submissions, we aim to deduct exercise difficulty, student patterns in approaching the tasks and potential flaws in task descriptions and preparatory videos

Industrial Smoke Detection and Visualization (Yen-Chia Hsu - 17 September, 2018)
To raise the public awareness of environmental science and improve the air quality in local areas, we are currently collaborating with a local community in monitoring and documenting fugitive emissions from a coke refinery. We have helped the community members build a live camera system which captures and visualizes high resolution timelapse imagery starting from November 2014

Multi-view Models for Political Ideology Detection of News Articles (Vivek Kulkarni - 10 September, 2018)
Our model draws on advances in representation learning in natural language processing and network science to capture cues from both textual content and the network structure of news articles. We empirically evaluate our model against a battery of baselines and show that our model outperforms state of the art by 10 percentage points F1 score.

Analysis of the generalization error: Empirical risk minimization over deep artificial neural networks overcomes the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of Black-Scholes partial differential equations (Julius Berner - 9 September, 2018)
Kolmogorov PDEs have been widely used in models from engineering, finance, and the natural sciences. In particular we show that for Kolmogorov PDEs with affine drift and diffusion coefficients and a given accuracy $\varepsilon>0$, ERM over deep neural network hypothesis classes of size scaling polynomially in the dimension $d$ and $\varepsilon^{-1}$ and with a number of training samples scaling polynomially in the dimension $d$ and $\varepsilon^{-1}$ approximates the solution of the Kolmogorov PDE to within accuracy $\varepsilon$ with high probability
