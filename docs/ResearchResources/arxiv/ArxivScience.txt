Intrusion Detection Using Mouse Dynamics (Margit Antal - 10 October, 2018)
The Balabit data set was released in 2016 for a data science competition, which against the few subjects, can be considered the first adequate publicly available one. Set of actions-based evaluation achieves 0.92 AUC on the test part of the data set. However, the same type of evaluation conducted on the training part of the data set resulted in maximal AUC (1) using only 13 actions

Machine Learning Suites for Online Toxicity Detection (David Noever - 3 October, 2018)
To identify and classify toxic online commentary, the modern tools of data science transform raw text into key features from which either thresholding or learning algorithms can make predictions for monitoring offensive conversations. We systematically evaluate 62 classifiers representing 19 major algorithmic families against features extracted from the Jigsaw dataset of Wikipedia comments. Among 28 features of syntax, sentiment, emotion and outlier word dictionaries, a simple bad word list proves most predictive of offensive commentary.

Optimizing the Human-Machine Partnership with Zooniverse (Lucy Fortson - 25 September, 2018)
With over 120 projects built reaching nearly 1.7 million volunteers, the Zooniverse.org platform has led the way in the application of Citizen Science as a method for closing the Big Data analysis gap. Since the launch in 2007 of the Galaxy Zoo project, the Zooniverse platform has enabled significant contributions across many disciplines; e.g., in ecology, humanities, and astronomy. To cope with the larger datasets looming on the horizon such as astronomy's Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) or the 100's of TB from ecology projects annually, Zooniverse has been researching a system design that is optimized for efficiency in task assignment and incorporating human and machine classifiers into the classification engine

Analysis of the generalization error: Empirical risk minimization over deep artificial neural networks overcomes the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of Black-Scholes partial differential equations (Julius Berner - 9 September, 2018)
Kolmogorov PDEs have been widely used in models from engineering, finance, and the natural sciences. In particular we show that for Kolmogorov PDEs with affine drift and diffusion coefficients and a given accuracy $\varepsilon>0$, ERM over deep neural network hypothesis classes of size scaling polynomially in the dimension $d$ and $\varepsilon^{-1}$ and with a number of training samples scaling polynomially in the dimension $d$ and $\varepsilon^{-1}$ approximates the solution of the Kolmogorov PDE to within accuracy $\varepsilon$ with high probability

We calculate that optoelectronic networks the area of a large data center ($10^5$\,m$^2$) will be capable of system-wide information integration at $1$\,MHz. At frequencies of cortex-wide integration in the human brain ($4$\,Hz, theta band), optoelectronic systems could integrate information across the surface of the earth.

Challenges of capturing engagement on Facebook for Altmetrics (Asura Enkhbayar - 4 September, 2018)
In order to investigate this discrepancy we set out to explore engagement numbers through their Graph API by querying the Facebook API with multiple URLs for a random set of 103,539 articles from the Web of Science. We found that the engagement numbers for 11.8% of all articles that have been shared on Facebook at least once are not reliable because of these problems. Moreover, we were unable to identify the URL for 11.6% of the articles in our data.

Migrating Knowledge between Physical Scenarios based on Artificial Neural Networks (Yurui Qu - 27 August, 2018)
Deep learning is known to be data-hungry, which hinders its application in many areas of science when datasets are small. First, we demonstrate that in predicting the transmission from multilayer photonic film, the relative error rate is reduced by 46.8% (26.5%) when the source data comes from 10-layer (8-layer) films and the target data comes from 8-layer (10-layer) films. Second, we show that the relative error rate is decreased by 22% when knowledge is transferred between two very different physical scenarios: transmission from multilayer films and scattering from multilayer nanoparticles

Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus: a systematic comparison of citations in 252 subject categories (Alberto MartÃ­n-MartÃ­n - 5 October, 2018)
Despite citation counts from Google Scholar (GS), Web of Science (WoS), and Scopus being widely consulted by researchers and sometimes used in research evaluations, there is no recent or systematic evidence about the differences between them. In response, this paper investigates 2,448,055 citations to 2,299 English-language highly-cited documents from 252 GS subject categories published in 2006, comparing GS, the WoS Core Collection, and Scopus. GS consistently found the largest percentage of citations across all areas (93%-96%), far ahead of Scopus (35%-77%) and WoS (27%-73%). GS found nearly all the WoS (95%) and Scopus (92%) citations. Most citations found only by GS were from non-journal sources (48%-65%), including theses, books, conference papers, and unpublished materials. Many were non-English (19%-38%), and they tended to be much less cited than citing sources that were also in Scopus or WoS
