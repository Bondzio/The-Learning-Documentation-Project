Bengali to Assamese Statistical Machine Translation using Moses (Corpus Based) (Nayan Jyoti Kalita - 5 April, 2015)
A parallel corpus of 17100 sentences in Bengali and Assamese has been utilized for preparing within this framework

An implementation of Apertium based Assamese morphological analyzer (Mirzanur Rahman - 13 March, 2015)
In our work we have used Apertium based Finite-State-Transducers for developing morphological analyzer for Assamese Language with some limited domain and we get 72.7% accuracy

Online Stroke and Akshara Recognition GUI in Assamese Language Using Hidden Markov Model (SRM Prasanna - 9 July, 2014)
The Assamese aksharas are combination of a number of strokes, the maximum number of strokes taken to make a combination being eight. A Hidden Markov Model is used to train 181 different stroke patterns which generates a model used during stroke level testing. We have got a stroke level performance of 94.14% and akshara level performance of 84.2%.

A Survey of Named Entity Recognition in Assamese and other Indian Languages (Gitimoni Talukdar - 9 July, 2014)
Assamese like other Indian languages is agglutinative and suffers from lack of appropriate resources as Named Entity Recognition requires large data sets, gazetteer list, dictionary etc and some useful feature like capitalization as found in English cannot be found in Assamese. Apart from this we also describe some of the issues faced in Assamese while doing Named Entity Recognition.

Assamese-English Bilingual Machine Translation (Kalyanee Kanchan Baruah - 8 July, 2014)
A difference in BLEU scores is obtained while translating sentences from Assamese to English and vice-versa. Since Indian languages are morphologically very rich hence translation is relatively harder from English to Assamese resulting in a low BLEU score

Development and Transcription of Assamese Speech Corpus (Himangshu Sarma - 27 September, 2013)
In this report we describe our effort on development of Assamese speech corpus. Being a less computationally aware language, this is the first effort to develop speech corpus for Assamese

Sparse arrays of signatures for online character recognition (Benjamin Graham - 1 December, 2013)
Using datasets of letters, numbers, Assamese and Chinese characters, we show that the first, second, and even the third iterated integrals contain useful information for consumption by a CNN.

Parsing of part-of-speech tagged Assamese Texts (Mirzanur Rahman - 9 December, 2009)
Our parsing program finds the grammatical errors, if any, in the Assamese sentence. If there is no error, the program will generate the parse tree for the Assamese sentence

ANN-based Innovative Segmentation Method for Handwritten text in Assamese (Kaustubh Bhattacharyya - 4 November, 2009)
This work explores the application of ANN as an aid to segmentation of handwritten characters in Assamese- an important language in the North Eastern part of India
