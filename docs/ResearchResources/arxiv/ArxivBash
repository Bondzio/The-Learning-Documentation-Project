NL2Bash: A Corpus and Semantic Parser for Natural Language Interface to the Linux Operating System (Xi Victoria Lin - 2 March, 2018)
We present new data and semantic parsing methods for the problem of mapping English sentences to Bash commands (NL2Bash). We take a first step in this domain, by providing a new dataset of challenging but commonly used Bash commands and expert-written English descriptions, along with baseline methods to establish performance levels on this task.

Inforence: Effective Fault Localization Based on Information-Theoretic Analysis and Statistical Causal Inference (Farid Feyzi - 9 December, 2017)
To validate Inforence, the results of our experiments with seven sets of programs include Siemens suite, gzip, grep, sed, space, make and bash are presented. The experimental results prove the outperformance of the proposed method compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.

UbuntuWorld 1.0 LTS - A Platform for Automated Problem Solving & Troubleshooting in the Ubuntu OS (Tathagata Chakraborti - 12 August, 2017)
Specifically, we propose to use the Bash terminal as a simulator of the Ubuntu environment for a learning-based agent and demonstrate the usefulness of adopting reinforcement learning (RL) techniques for basic problem solving and troubleshooting in this environment

Reliable Deniable Communication: Hiding Messages in Noise (Pak Hou Che - 11 July, 2016)
Our work builds upon the work of Bash et al on AWGN channels (but with common randomness) and differs from other recent works (by Wang et al and Bloch) in two important ways - firstly our deniability metric is variational distance (as opposed to Kullback-Leibler divergence), and secondly, our techniques are significantly different from these works.

Comparing Selected Criteria of Programming Languages Java, PHP, C++, Perl, Haskell, AspectJ, Ruby, COBOL, Bash Scripts and Scheme Revision 1.0 - a Team CPLgroup COMP6411-S10 Term Report (Sultan S. Al-Qahtani - 20 August, 2010)
In this paper we present a comparative study between ten programming languages: Haskell, Java, Perl, C++, AspectJ, COBOL, Ruby, PHP, Bash Scripts, and Scheme; with respect of the following criteria: Secure programming practices, web applications development, web services design and composition, object oriented-based abstraction, reflection, aspect-orientation, functional programming, declarative programming, batch scripting, and user interface prototype design.

Kleene, Rogers and Rice Theorems Revisited in C and in Bash (Salvatore Caporaso - 8 December, 2007)
The recursion theorem in the weak form {e}(z)=x(e,z) (universal function not needed) and in Rogers form {n}(z)={{x}(n)}(z) and Rice theorem are proved a first time using programs in C, and a second time with scripts in Bash.
