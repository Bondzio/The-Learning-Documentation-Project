Characterization of ultra-low carbon steel: A preliminary approach to investigate the quality and standards of locally-available steel ( Sulaiman - 25 May, 2018)
Ultra-low carbon steel, in the form of a sheet, was collected from the Mughal Steel Industry, Peshawar, Pakistan. The microstructure analysis revealed that ultra-fine grain can be obtained for the etchant composition of 8 % nitric acid in ethanol. Additionally, we noticed that the best etching time, for getting a clear morphology, was 90 s. Thermal analysis showed a minor weight loss followed by weight gain of 1.31 wt %

Evaluation of tsunami wave energy generated by earthquakes in the Makran subduction zone (Amin Rashidi - 2 March, 2018)
The Makran subduction zone, an approximate 1000 km section of the Eurasian-Arabian plate, is located offshore of Southern Iran and Pakistan. In 1945, the Makran subduction zone (MSZ) generated a tsunamigenic earthquake with a magnitude of Mw 8.1. The whole rupture of the plate boundary is divided into 20 segments with width of order of 200 km and a co-seismic slip of 10 m but with various lengths. The total tsunami wave energy displays only 0.33% of the seismic energy released from the earthquake source

The 2010 and 2014 floods in India and Pakistan: dynamical influences on vertical motion and precipitation (Daniel A. Shaevitz - 3 March, 2016)
Devastating floods in northeast Pakistan and northern India occurred in July 2010 and September 2014 as a consequence of extreme precipitation events. The 2010 and 2014 flood events had similar synoptic flow patterns that led to an anomalously high moisture content in the flood region

Preventive Care Resource Allocation in Developing Countries: Can Rational Planning Techniques Help in Allocating Vaccinators in Dera Ismail Khan District of Pakistan? (Mohammad Ishfaq - 5 June, 2013)
This paper explores the application of integer programming techniques to support the Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI) service in the Dera Ismail Khan District of Pakistan. The main concern here is equitable service delivery to decentralized localities based on two criteria: (1) achieving the highest possible level of vaccination among the target population; and 2) ensuring equality among geographically scattered populations, especially in rural dwellings
