A search for optical bursts from the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102 (Liam K Hardy - 21 August, 2017)
We present a search for optical bursts from the repeating fast radio burst FRB 121102 using simultaneous observations with the high-speed optical camera ULTRASPEC on the 2.4-m Thai National Telescope and radio observations with the 100-m Effelsberg Radio Telescope. A total of 13 radio bursts were detected, but we found no evidence for corresponding optical bursts in our 70.7-ms frames. The 5-sigma upper limit to the optical flux density during our observations is 0.33 mJy at 767nm. This gives an upper limit for the optical burst fluence of 0.046 Jy ms, which constrains the broadband spectral index of the burst emission to alpha < -0.2. Two of the radio pulses are separated by just 34 ms, which may represent an upper limit on a possible underlying periodicity (a rotation period typical of pulsars), or these pulses may have come from a single emission window that is a small fraction of a possible period.

Transit timing variation and transmission spectroscopy analyses of the hot Neptune GJ3470b (S. Awiphan - 20 September, 2016)
We present transit timing variation (TTV) and transmission spectroscopy analyses of multi-wavelength optical photometry from 2.4-m and 0.5-m telescopes at the Thai National Observatory, and the 0.6-m PROMPT-8 telescope in Chile. The presence of a hot Jupiter with a period of less than 10 days or a planet with an orbital period between 2.5 and 4.0 days are excluded. Combined optical and near-infrared transmission spectroscopy favour an H/He dominated haze (mean molecular weight 1.08$\pm$0.20) with high particle abundance at high altitude

Lunar Occultations of Eighteen Stellar Sources from the 2.4-m Thai National Telescope (A. Richichi - 21 December, 2015)
We report further results from the program of lunar occultation (LO) observations started at the 2.4-m Thai National Telescope (TNT) in 2014. We have recorded LO events of 18 stellar sources, leading to the detection of four angular diameters and two binary stars. We could resolve angular diameters as small as 2 milliarcseconds (mas) and projected separations as small as 4mas. The first-time angular diameters for o Psc, HR 6196 and 75 Leo are in good agreement with expected values, while that of Pi Leo agrees with the average of previous determinations but has a higher accuracy. We also obtain an accuratemeasurement of the companion in 31 Ari, revealing inconsistencies in the currently available orbital parameters

Infrastructure and methods for real-time predictions of the 2014 dengue fever season in Thailand (Nicholas G. Reich - 15 November, 2015)
We developed a real-time forecasting model for dengue hemorrhagic fever in the 77 provinces of Thailand. We created an operational and computational infrastructure that generated multi-step predictions of dengue incidence in Thai provinces every two weeks throughout 2014. These predictions show mixed performance across provinces, out-performing naÃ¯ve seasonal models in over half of provinces at a 1.5 month horizon

ULTRASPEC: a high-speed imaging photometer on the 2.4-m Thai National Telescope (V. S. Dhillon - 12 August, 2014)
ULTRASPEC is a high-speed imaging photometer mounted permanently at one of the Nasmyth focii of the 2.4-m Thai National Telescope (TNT) on Doi Inthanon, Thailand's highest mountain. The EMCCD has two outputs - a normal output that provides a readout noise of 2.3 e- and an avalanche output that can provide essentially zero readout noise. The instrument saw first light on the TNT in November 2013 and will be used to study rapid variability in the Universe

First Lunar Occultation Results from the 2.4 m Thai National Telescope equipped with ULTRASPEC (A. Richichi - 1 August, 2014)
The recently inaugurated 2.4\,m Thai National Telescope (TNT) is equipped, among other instruments, with the ULTRASPEC low-noise, frame-transfer EMCCD camera. With our observation we are able to place stringent limits on the projected angular separation ($<0\farcs003$) and brightness ($Î{\rm m} > 5$) of a putative companion

Part of Speech Tagging in Thai Language Using Support Vector Machine (Masaki Murata - 5 December, 2001)
When a small Thai corpus is used for training, these taggers have tagging accuracies of 94.4% and 95.5% (accounting only for the ambiguous words in terms of the part of speech), respectively. Our results showed that the support vector machine method has the best precision (96.1%), and that it is capable of improving the accuracy of tagging in the Thai language

Log-periodic power law bubbles in Latin-American and Asian markets and correlated anti-bubbles in Western stock markets: An empirical study (Anders Johansen - 19 July, 1999)
Twenty-two significant bubbles followed by large crashes or by severe corrections in the Argentinian, Brazilian, Chilean, Mexican, Peruvian, Venezuelan, Hong-Kong, Indonesian, Korean, Malaysian, Philippine and Thai stock markets indices are identified and analysed for log-periodic signatures decorating an average power law acceleration. 1990 and the price of Gold starting in Sept. 1980 thus rendering a qualitative symmetry of bubble and anti-bubble around the date of the peak of the market. A set of secondary western stock market indices (London, Sydney, Auckland, Paris, Madrid, Milan, Zurich) as well as the Hong-Kong stock market are also shown to exhibit well-correlated log-periodic power law anti-bubbles over a period 6-15 months triggered by a rash of crises on emerging markets in the early 1994. As the US market declined by no more than 10% during the beginning of that period and quickly recovered, this suggests that these smaller stock western markets can ``phase lock'' (in a weak sense) not only because of the over-arching influence of Wall Street but also independently of the current trends on Wall Street due to other influences.

Classifier Assignment by Corpus-based Approach (Virach Sornlertlamvanich - 7 October, 1995)
In Thai language, it frequently happens that there is fluctuation in the choice of classifier for a given concrete noun, both from the point of view of the whole spe ech community and individual speakers. We propose a corpus-based method (Biber, 1993; Nagao, 1993; Smadja, 1993) which generates Noun Classifier Associations (NCA) to overcome the problems in classifier assignment and semantic construction of noun phrase

End-to-End Text Classification via Image-based Embedding using Character-level Networks (Shunsuke Kitada - 10 October, 2018)
For analysing and/or understanding languages having no word boundaries based on morphological analysis such as Japanese, Chinese, and Thai, it is desirable to perform appropriate word segmentation before word embeddings. Through various experiments, we found and confirmed that our CE-CLCNN captured closely embedded features for visually and semantically similar characters and achieves state-of-the-art results on several open document classification tasks
