Towards Better Summarizing Bug Reports with Crowdsourcing Elicited Attributes (He Jiang - 28 September, 2018)
Then, we propose a new method named Crowd-Attribute to infer new effective attributes from the crowdgenerated data in crowdsourcing and develop a new tool named Crowdsourcing Software Engineering Platform to facilitate this method. With Crowd-Attribute, we successfully construct 11 new attributes and propose a new supervised algorithm named Logistic Regression with Crowdsourced Attributes (LRCA). Experiments over both the public data set SDS with 36 manually annotated bug reports and new large-scale data sets demonstrate that LRCA can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms for bug report summarization.

Motivation Since 2010, Renault has established a framework to develop engine control software for Diesel and Gasoline engines [6]. In the Renault EMS architecture software is composed in to about 20 functions, such as Air System, Combustion etc. The Renault EMS development process includes basically the following steps [5]. 1. Specification of about 200 generic configurable modules per ECU using MATLAB/Simulink. 2. 3. To insure software quality, this step is repeatedly performed with steps 1 and 2, based on the simulation capabilities of MATLAB/Simulink. 4. 5. 6. In contrast to step 3, the interactions of all modules and interactions with the system environment are visible then and subject to testing. Critical assessment of the above process shows that there is a considerable delay between delivery of a set of specifications to the software project team (at the end of step 3) and system-level tests based on an ECU that runs entire software (step 6)

Extensive packet-level simulation results show that 1) compared to several widely-used baseline methods, DRL-TE significantly reduces end-to-end delay and consistently improves the network utility, while offering better or comparable throughput; 2) DRL-TE is robust to network changes; and 3) DRL-TE consistently outperforms a state-ofthe-art DRL method (for continuous control), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), which, however, does not offer satisfying performance.

Online Multicast Traffic Engineering for Software-Defined Networks (Sheng-Hao Chiang - 30 December, 2017)
Different from traditional shortest-path trees (SPT) and graph theoretical Steiner trees (ST), which concentrate on routing one tree at any instant, online SDN multicast traffic engineering is more challenging because it needs to support dynamic group membership and optimize a sequence of correlated trees without the knowledge of future join and leave, whereas the scalability of SDN due to limited TCAM is also crucial. We prove that OBST is NP-hard and does not have a $|D_{max}|^{1-Îµ}$-competitive algorithm for any $Îµ>0$, where $|D_{max}|$ is the largest group size at any time. The simulations and implementation on real SDNs with YouTube traffic manifest that the total cost can be reduced by at least 25% compared with SPT and ST, and the computation time is small for massive SDN.

Long-Term Mobile Traffic Forecasting Using Deep Spatio-Temporal Neural Networks (Chaoyun Zhang - 21 December, 2017)
Forecasting with high accuracy the volume of data traffic that mobile users will consume is becoming increasingly important for precision traffic engineering, demand-aware network resource allocation, as well as public transportation. Experiments we conduct with real-world mobile traffic data sets, collected over 60 days in both urban and rural areas, demonstrate that the proposed (D-)STN schemes perform up to 10-hour long predictions with remarkable accuracy, irrespective of the time of day when they are triggered. Specifically, our solutions achieve up to 61% smaller prediction errors as compared to widely used forecasting approaches, while operating with up to 600 times shorter measurement intervals.

On modeling vagueness and uncertainty in data-to-text systems through fuzzy sets (A. Ramos-Soto - 27 October, 2017)
This paper intends to bridge this gap by answering the following questions: What does vagueness mean in fuzzy sets theory? What does vagueness mean in data-to-text contexts? In what ways can fuzzy sets theory contribute to improve data-to-text systems? What are the challenges that researchers from both disciplines need to address for a successful integration of fuzzy sets into data-to-text systems? In what cases should the use of fuzzy sets be avoided in D2T? For this, we review and discuss the state of the art of vagueness modeling in natural language generation and data-to-text, describe potential and actual usages of fuzzy sets in data-to-text contexts, and provide some additional insights about the engineering of data-to-text systems that make use of fuzzy set-based techniques.

In this paper, we present an automated feature engineering based approach to dramatically reduce false positives in fraud prediction. It is estimated that only 1 in 5 declared as fraud are actually fraud and roughly 1 in every 6 customers have had a valid transaction declined in the past year. We generate 237 features (>100 behavioral patterns) for each transaction, and use a random forest to learn a classifier. On an unseen data of 1.852 million transactions, we were able to reduce the false positives by 54% and provide a savings of 190K euros. We found that our solution can maintain similar benefits even when historical features are computed once every 7 days.

On Evidence-based Risk Management in Requirements Engineering (Daniel MÃ©ndez FernÃ¡ndez - 31 July, 2017)
Background: The sensitivity of Requirements Engineering (RE) to the context makes it difficult to efficiently control problems therein, thus, hampering an effective risk management devoted to allow for early corrective or even preventive measures. Research Method: We use survey data from 228 companies and build a probabilistic network that supports the forecast of context-specific RE phenomena. Results: Our results from an initial validation in 6 companies strengthen our confidence that the approach increases the awareness for individual risk factors in RE, and the feedback further allows for disseminating our approach into practice.

Risk-Informed Interference Assessment for Shared Spectrum Bands: A Wi-Fi/LTE Coexistence Case Study (Andra M. Voicu - 8 June, 2017)
In this paper we demonstrate the benefit of risk-informed interference assessment to aid spectrum regulators in making decisions, and to readily convey engineering insight. Wi-Fi/LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed band, and we demonstrate that this method comprehensively quantifies the interference impact. Our results show that no regulatory intervention is needed to ensure harmonious technical Wi-Fi/LTE coexistence: for the typically large number of channels available in the 5 GHz band, the risk for Wi-Fi from LTE is negligible, rendering policy and engineering concerns largely moot. For LTE intra-technology inter-operator coexistence, both variants typically coexist well in the 5 GHz band, but for dense deployments, implementing listen-before-talk causes less interference.
