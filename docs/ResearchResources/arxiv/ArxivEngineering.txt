Towards Better Summarizing Bug Reports with Crowdsourcing Elicited Attributes (He Jiang - 28 September, 2018)
Then, we propose a new method named Crowd-Attribute to infer new effective attributes from the crowdgenerated data in crowdsourcing and develop a new tool named Crowdsourcing Software Engineering Platform to facilitate this method. With Crowd-Attribute, we successfully construct 11 new attributes and propose a new supervised algorithm named Logistic Regression with Crowdsourced Attributes (LRCA). Experiments over both the public data set SDS with 36 manually annotated bug reports and new large-scale data sets demonstrate that LRCA can consistently outperform the state-of-the-art algorithms for bug report summarization.

Motivation Since 2010, Renault has established a framework to develop engine control software for Diesel and Gasoline engines [6]. In the Renault EMS architecture software is composed in to about 20 functions, such as Air System, Combustion etc. The Renault EMS development process includes basically the following steps [5]. 1. Specification of about 200 generic configurable modules per ECU using MATLAB/Simulink. 2. 3. To insure software quality, this step is repeatedly performed with steps 1 and 2, based on the simulation capabilities of MATLAB/Simulink. 4. 5. 6. In contrast to step 3, the interactions of all modules and interactions with the system environment are visible then and subject to testing. Critical assessment of the above process shows that there is a considerable delay between delivery of a set of specifications to the software project team (at the end of step 3) and system-level tests based on an ECU that runs entire software (step 6)

Extensive packet-level simulation results show that 1) compared to several widely-used baseline methods, DRL-TE significantly reduces end-to-end delay and consistently improves the network utility, while offering better or comparable throughput; 2) DRL-TE is robust to network changes; and 3) DRL-TE consistently outperforms a state-ofthe-art DRL method (for continuous control), Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG), which, however, does not offer satisfying performance.

Online Multicast Traffic Engineering for Software-Defined Networks (Sheng-Hao Chiang - 30 December, 2017)
Different from traditional shortest-path trees (SPT) and graph theoretical Steiner trees (ST), which concentrate on routing one tree at any instant, online SDN multicast traffic engineering is more challenging because it needs to support dynamic group membership and optimize a sequence of correlated trees without the knowledge of future join and leave, whereas the scalability of SDN due to limited TCAM is also crucial. We prove that OBST is NP-hard and does not have a $|D_{max}|^{1-Îµ}$-competitive algorithm for any $Îµ>0$, where $|D_{max}|$ is the largest group size at any time. The simulations and implementation on real SDNs with YouTube traffic manifest that the total cost can be reduced by at least 25% compared with SPT and ST, and the computation time is small for massive SDN.

Long-Term Mobile Traffic Forecasting Using Deep Spatio-Temporal Neural Networks (Chaoyun Zhang - 21 December, 2017)
Forecasting with high accuracy the volume of data traffic that mobile users will consume is becoming increasingly important for precision traffic engineering, demand-aware network resource allocation, as well as public transportation. Experiments we conduct with real-world mobile traffic data sets, collected over 60 days in both urban and rural areas, demonstrate that the proposed (D-)STN schemes perform up to 10-hour long predictions with remarkable accuracy, irrespective of the time of day when they are triggered. Specifically, our solutions achieve up to 61% smaller prediction errors as compared to widely used forecasting approaches, while operating with up to 600 times shorter measurement intervals.

On modeling vagueness and uncertainty in data-to-text systems through fuzzy sets (A. Ramos-Soto - 27 October, 2017)
This paper intends to bridge this gap by answering the following questions: What does vagueness mean in fuzzy sets theory? What does vagueness mean in data-to-text contexts? In what ways can fuzzy sets theory contribute to improve data-to-text systems? What are the challenges that researchers from both disciplines need to address for a successful integration of fuzzy sets into data-to-text systems? In what cases should the use of fuzzy sets be avoided in D2T? For this, we review and discuss the state of the art of vagueness modeling in natural language generation and data-to-text, describe potential and actual usages of fuzzy sets in data-to-text contexts, and provide some additional insights about the engineering of data-to-text systems that make use of fuzzy set-based techniques.

In this paper, we present an automated feature engineering based approach to dramatically reduce false positives in fraud prediction. It is estimated that only 1 in 5 declared as fraud are actually fraud and roughly 1 in every 6 customers have had a valid transaction declined in the past year. We generate 237 features (>100 behavioral patterns) for each transaction, and use a random forest to learn a classifier. On an unseen data of 1.852 million transactions, we were able to reduce the false positives by 54% and provide a savings of 190K euros. We found that our solution can maintain similar benefits even when historical features are computed once every 7 days.

On Evidence-based Risk Management in Requirements Engineering (Daniel MÃ©ndez FernÃ¡ndez - 31 July, 2017)
Background: The sensitivity of Requirements Engineering (RE) to the context makes it difficult to efficiently control problems therein, thus, hampering an effective risk management devoted to allow for early corrective or even preventive measures. Research Method: We use survey data from 228 companies and build a probabilistic network that supports the forecast of context-specific RE phenomena. Results: Our results from an initial validation in 6 companies strengthen our confidence that the approach increases the awareness for individual risk factors in RE, and the feedback further allows for disseminating our approach into practice.

Risk-Informed Interference Assessment for Shared Spectrum Bands: A Wi-Fi/LTE Coexistence Case Study (Andra M. Voicu - 8 June, 2017)

Wi-Fi/LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed band, and we demonstrate that this method comprehensively quantifies the interference impact. Our results show that no regulatory intervention is needed to ensure harmonious technical Wi-Fi/LTE coexistence: for the typically large number of channels available in the 5 GHz band, the risk for Wi-Fi from LTE is negligible, rendering policy and engineering concerns largely moot. For LTE intra-technology inter-operator coexistence, both variants typically coexist well in the 5 GHz band, but for dense deployments, implementing listen-before-talk causes less interference.

Beyond Evolutionary Algorithms for Search-based Software Engineering (Jianfeng Chen - 17 September, 2017)
Context: Evolutionary algorithms typically require a large number of evaluations (of solutions) to converge - which can be very slow and expensive to evaluate.Objective: To solve search-based software engineering (SE) problems, using fewer evaluations than evolutionary methods.Method: Instead of mutating a small population, we build a very large initial population which is then culled using a recursive bi-clustering chop approach. Results: Using just a few evaluations (under 100), we can obtain comparable results to state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms.Conclusion: Just because something works, and is widespread use, does not necessarily mean that there is no value in seeking methods to improve that method

The Influence of Teamwork Quality on Software Team Performance (Emily Weimar - 22 January, 2017)
Traditionally, software quality is thought to depend on sound software engineering and development methodologies such as structured programming and agile development. Since the success rate of software development projects is low (Wateridge, 1995; The Standish Group, 2009), it is important to understand which characteristics of interactions within software development teams significantly influence performance. The relationship between TWQ and team performance and the improvement of the model are tested using data from 252 team members and stakeholders. Results show that teamwork quality is significantly related to team performance, as rated by both team members and stakeholders: TWQ explains 81% of the variance of team performance as rated by team members and 61% as rated by stakeholders

Revealing Utilization at Internet Interconnection Points (Nick Feamster - 4 September, 2016)
One mechanism, developed by DeepField Networks, allows Internet service providers (ISPs) to gather and aggregate utilization information using network flow statistics, standardized in the Internet Engineering Task Force as IPFIX. This report (1) provides an overview of the method that DeepField Networks is using to measure the utilization of various interconnection links between content providers and ISPs or links over which traffic between content and ISPs flow; and (2) surveys the findings from five months of Internet utilization data provided by seven participating ISPs---Bright House Networks, Comcast, Cox, Mediacom, Midco, Suddenlink, and Time Warner Cable---whose access networks represent about 50% of all U.S. The dataset includes about 97% of the paid peering, settlement-free peering, and ISP-paid transit links of each of the participating ISPs. Initial analysis of the data---which comprises more than 1,000 link groups, representing the diverse and substitutable available routes---suggests that many interconnects have significant spare capacity, that this spare capacity exists both across ISPs in each region and in aggregate for any individual ISP, and that the aggregate utilization across interconnects interconnects is roughly 50% during peak periods.

Simultaneous Feature Learning and Hash Coding with Deep Neural Networks (Hanjiang Lai - 13 April, 2015)
For most existing hashing methods, an image is first encoded as a vector of hand-engineering visual features, followed by another separate projection or quantization step that generates binary codes. The pipeline of the proposed deep architecture consists of three building blocks: 1) a sub-network with a stack of convolution layers to produce the effective intermediate image features; 2) a divide-and-encode module to divide the intermediate image features into multiple branches, each encoded into one hash bit; and 3) a triplet ranking loss designed to characterize that one image is more similar to the second image than to the third one

Further, based on the comparison results, we selected 2 modeling approaches, Reusable Aspect Models and Theme/UML, and proceeded to evaluate them in a detailed way from specific perspectives of design and its mapping to the implementation code. Results of the comparison of 14 approaches show that majority of aspect modeling approaches lack from different perspectives, which results in reducing their use in practice within the context of model-driven engineering

Artificial Mutation inspired Hyper-heuristic for Runtime Usage of Multi-objective Algorithms (Donia El Kateb - 18 February, 2014)
In the last years, multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEA) have been applied to different software engineering problems where many conflicting objectives have to be optimized simultaneously. In this paper, we reconsider this founding analogy to accelerate convergence of MOEA, by looking at modern biology studies: artificial selection has been used to achieve an anticipated specific purpose instead of only relying on crossover and natural selection (i.e., Muller et al [18] research on artificial mutation of fruits with X-Ray). Putting aside the analogy with natural selection , the present paper proposes an hyper-heuristic for MOEA algorithms named Sputnik 1 that uses artificial selective mutation to improve the convergence speed of MOEA

Many scientific and engineering fields involve analyzing network data.

Interactive Interference Alignment (Quan Geng - 11 October, 2013)
The flexibility afforded by interaction among sources and destinations allows for the derivation of interference alignment (IA) strategies that have desirable "engineering properties": insensitivity to the rationality or irrationality of channel parameters, small block lengths and finite SNR operations. In particular, we show the {\em first simple scheme} (having finite block length, for channels having no diversity) for $K=3,4$ that can achieve the optimal degrees of freedom of $\frac{K}{2}$ even after accounting for the cost of interaction

Challenges and Directions for Engineering Multi-agent Systems (Michael Winikoff - 6 September, 2012)
The good news is that over the past decade we've made considerable progress on techniques for engineering multi-agent systems: we have good, usable methodologies, and mature tools. However, industry involvement in AAMAS appears to be declining (as measured by industry sponsorship of the conference), and industry affiliated attendants at AAMAS 2012 were few (1-2%). This observation is corroborated by the results of a 2008 survey by Frank and Virginia Dignum. (3) Move to the "macro" level: develop techniques for designing and implementing interaction, integrate micro (single cognitive agent) and macro (MAS) design and implementation; (4) Develop techniques for the Assurance of MAS; and (5) Re-engage with the US.

Besides the stated perceptions and analyses perhaps ignoring socio-political and scientific temperaments in developing nations, the following questions arise: How did the BD phenomenon naturally occur, post technological developments in Computer and Communications Technology and how did different experts react to it? Are academicians elsewhere agreeing on the fact that BD is a new science? Granted that big data science is a new science what are its foundations as compared to conventional topics in Physics, Chemistry or Biology? Or, is it similar to astronomy or nuclear science? What are the technological and engineering implications and how these can be advantageously used to augment business intelligence, for example? Will the industry adopt the changes due to tactical advantages? How can BD success stories be carried over elsewhere? How will BD affect the Computer Science and other curricula? How will BD benefit different segments of our society on a large scale? To answer these, an appreciation of the BD as a science and as a technology is necessary

This paper presents a non-manual design engineering method based on heuristic search algorithm to search for candidate agents in the solution space which formed by artificial intelligence agents modeled on the base of bionics.Compared with the artificial design method represented by meta-learning and the bionics method represented by the neural architecture chip,this method is more feasible for realizing artificial general intelligence,and it has a much better interaction with cognitive neuroscience;at the same time,the engineering method is based on the theoretical hypothesis that the final learning algorithm is stable in certain scenarios,and has generalization ability in various scenarios.The paper discusses the theory preliminarily and proposes the possible correlation between the theory and the fixed-point theorem in the field of mathematics.Limited by the author's knowledge level,this correlation is proposed only as a kind of conjecture.

A Deep Neural Network Approach To Parallel Sentence Extraction (Francis GrÃ©goire - 27 September, 2017)
In contrast to previous approaches, which typically rely on multiples models and various word alignment features, by leveraging continuous vector representation of sentences we remove the need of any domain specific feature engineering. Using a siamese bidirectional recurrent neural networks, our results against a strong baseline based on a state-of-the-art parallel sentence extraction system show a significant improvement in both the quality of the extracted parallel sentences and the translation performance of statistical machine translation systems

Despite superficial appearances, it is shown that many of the key ideas in software engineering have counterparts in the structure and workings of the SP system. Potential benefits of this new approach to software engineering include: the automation or semi-automation of software development, with support for programming of the SP system where necessary; allowing programmers to concentrate on 'world-oriented' parallelism, without worries about parallelism to speed up processing; support for the long-term goal of programming the SP system via written or spoken natural language; reducing or eliminating the distinction between 'design' and 'implementation'; reducing or eliminating operations like compiling or interpretation; reducing or eliminating the need for verification of software; reducing the need for validation of software; no formal distinction between program and database; the potential for substantial reductions in the number of types of data file and the number of computer languages; benefits for version control; and reducing technical debt.
