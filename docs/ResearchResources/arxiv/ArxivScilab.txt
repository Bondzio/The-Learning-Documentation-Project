Remark on "Algorithm 916: Computing the Faddeyeva and Voigt functions": Efficiency Improvements and Fortran Translation (Mofreh R. Zaghloul - 26 May, 2015)
The current version of the code is provided in Matlab and Scilab in addition to a Fortran translation prepared to meet the needs of real-world problems where very large numbers of function evaluations would require the use of a compiled language. To fulfill this last requirement, a recently proposed reformed version of Humlicek's w4 routine, shown to maintain the claimed accuracy of the algorithm over a wide and fine grid is implemented in the present Fortran translation for the case of 4 significant figures

Fisher Matrix Preloaded -- Fisher4Cast (Bruce A. Bassett - 28 March, 2012)
Fisher4Cast was designed for ease of extension and, although written in Matlab, is easily portable to open-source alternatives such as Octave and Scilab. Early releases have been available at http://www.cosmology.org.za since May 2008 with 750 downloads in the first year. Version 2.2 is made public with this paper and includes a Quick Start guide and the code used to produce the figures in this paper, in the hope that it will be useful to the cosmology and wider scientific communities.
