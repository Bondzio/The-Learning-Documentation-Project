A scalable parallel finite element framework for growing geometries. Application to metal additive manufacturing (Eric Neiva - 8 October, 2018)
It is well-known that virtual part design and qualification in additive manufacturing requires highly-accurate multiscale and multiphysics analyses. After verification against a 3D benchmark, a strong scaling analysis is carried out for a simulation of 48 layers printed in a cuboid. The cuboid is adaptively meshed to model a layer-by-layer metal deposition process and the average global problem size amounts to 10.3 million unknowns. An unprecedented scalability for problems with growing domains is achieved, with the capability of simulating the printing and recoat of a single layer in 8 seconds average on 3,072 processors

The largest cognitive systems will be optoelectronic (Jeffrey M. Shainline - 7 September, 2018)

At frequencies of cortex-wide integration in the human brain ($4$\,Hz, theta band), optoelectronic systems could integrate information across the surface of the earth.

Rapid mixing of Glauber dynamics for colorings below Vigoda's $11/6$ threshold (Michelle Delcourt - 11 April, 2018)
A well-known conjecture in computer science and statistical physics is that Glauber dynamics on the set of $k$-colorings of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $Î$ is rapidly mixing for $k \geq Î+2$. In FOCS 1999, Vigoda showed rapid mixing of flip dynamics with certain flip parameters on the set of proper $k$-colorings for $k > \frac{11}{6}Î$, implying rapid mixing for Glauber dynamics. In this paper, we obtain the first improvement beyond the $\frac{11}{6}Î$ barrier for general graphs by showing rapid mixing for $k > (\frac{11}{6} - Î·)Î$ for some positive constant $Î·$. Combined, these results answer two open questions from Frieze and Vigoda's 2007 survey paper on Glauber dynamics for colorings.

Rapid mixing of Glauber dynamics for colorings below Vigoda's $11/6$ threshold (Michelle Delcourt - 11 April, 2018)
A well-known conjecture in computer science and statistical physics is that Glauber dynamics on the set of $k$-colorings of a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with maximum degree $Î$ is rapidly mixing for $k \geq Î+2$. In FOCS 1999, Vigoda showed rapid mixing of flip dynamics with certain flip parameters on the set of proper $k$-colorings for $k > \frac{11}{6}Î$, implying rapid mixing for Glauber dynamics. In this paper, we obtain the first improvement beyond the $\frac{11}{6}Î$ barrier for general graphs by showing rapid mixing for $k > (\frac{11}{6} - Î·)Î$ for some positive constant $Î·$. Combined, these results answer two open questions from Frieze and Vigoda's 2007 survey paper on Glauber dynamics for colorings.

Systematic design methodology for development and flight testing of a variable pitch quadrotor biplane VTOL UAV for payload delivery (Vishnu S. Chipade - 7 January, 2018)
First, the design of proprotors is carried out using a physics based modified Blade Element Momentum Theory (BEMT) analysis, which is validated using experimental data generated for the purpose. The proprotor design with 24 deg preset angle and -24 deg twist is designed based on 70% weightage to forward flight and 30% weightage to hovering flight conditions. The operating RPM of the proprotors is reduced from 3200 during hover to 2000 during forward flight to ensure optimal performance during cruise flight. The estimated power consumption during forward flight mode is 64% less than that required for hover, establishing the benefit of this hybrid concept

Specifically, using only three transceivers, the median localization error of MFDL is as low as 45$cm$ in an outdoor environment of 36$m^2$, and 55$cm$ in indoor settings of 25$m^2$. Increasing the number of transceivers to four allows us to achieve 75$cm$ median localization error in a 72$m^2$ indoor area, compared with the 1.1$m$ median localization error achieved by LiFS using 11 transceivers in a 70$m^2$ area.

For $Î±\in (1, \infty)$, the proof relies on a new Apollonius theorem for the Hellinger divergence, and for $Î±\in (0,1)$, the proof relies on the Banach-Alaoglu theorem from functional analysis.

A recursive algorithm of minimal complexity $O\left(n^{2}\right)$ for degree $n$ and FFT-based algorithms of complexity $O\left(n^{2}\log n\right) $ suitable for computation of rotation coefficients of large degrees are proposed, studied numerically, and cross-validated. It is shown that the latter algorithm can be used for $n\lesssim 10^{3}$ in double precision, while the former algorithm was tested for large $n$ (up to $10^{4}$ in our experiments) and demonstrated better performance and accuracy compared to the FFT-based algorithm.

The simulation estimates the critical temperature where the Ising model on the square lattice becomes magnetic to be Tc /J = 2.26934(6) using a finite size scaling analysis of the crossing points of Binder cumulants

Inside the clustering threshold for random linear equations (Pu Gao - 19 September, 2013)
This is part of a general clustering phenomenon which is hypothesized to arise in most of the commonly studied models of random constraint satisfaction problems, via sophisticated but mostly non-rigorous techniques from statistical physics. We extend that study to the range $c=c^*_r+o(1)$, showing that if $c=c^*_r+n^{-\d}, \d>0$, then the connectivity parameter of each $r$-XORSAT cluster is $n^{Î(\d)}$, as compared to $O(\log n)$ when $c=c^*_r+\e$

Spatial mixing and approximation algorithms for graphs with bounded connective constant (Alistair Sinclair - 9 October, 2014)
The hard core model in statistical physics is a probability distribution on independent sets in a graph in which the weight of any independent set I is proportional to lambda^(|I|), where lambda > 0 is the vertex activity. We show that there is an intimate connection between the connective constant of a graph and the phenomenon of strong spatial mixing (decay of correlations) for the hard core model; specifically, we prove that the hard core model with vertex activity lambda < lambda_c(Delta + 1) exhibits strong spatial mixing on any graph of connective constant Delta, irrespective of its maximum degree, and hence derive an FPTAS for the partition function of the hard core model on such graphs

Critical analysis of the Bennett-Riedel attack on secure cryptographic key distributions via the Kirchhoff-law-Johnson-noise scheme (Laszlo B. Kish - 20 October, 2013)

To show that thermodynamics and noise are essential for the security, we crack the BR system with 100% success via passive attacks, in ten different ways, and demonstrate that the same cracking methods do not function for the KLJN scheme that employs Johnson noise to provide security underpinned by the Second Law of Thermodynamics

In fact, from known results in physics, any system that exchanges information via the transfer of given physical resources, such as radio waves, particles and qubits, can conceivably reuse, at least part, of the received resources. In the system, a node can either send an "on" symbol (or "1"), which costs one unit of energy, or an "off" signal (or "0"), which does not require any energy expenditure. Upon reception of a "1" signal, the recipient node "harvests", with some probability, the energy contained in the signal and stores it for future communication tasks

The complexity of the fermionant, and immanants of constant width (Stephan Mertens - 16 October, 2011)
In the context of statistical physics, Chandrasekharan and Wiese recently introduced the \emph{fermionant} $\Ferm_k$, a determinant-like quantity where each permutation $Ï$ is weighted by $-k$ raised to the number of cycles in $Ï$. We show that computing $\Ferm_k$ is #P-hard under Turing reductions for any constant $k > 2$, and is $\oplusP$-hard for $k=2$, even for the adjacency matrices of planar graphs. As a consequence, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses, it is impossible to compute the immanant $\Imm_Î»\,A$ as a function of the Young diagram $Î»$ in polynomial time, even if the width of $Î»$ is restricted to be at most 2. In particular, if $\Ferm_2$ is in P, or if $\Imm_Î»$ is in P for all $Î»$ of width 2, then $\NP \subseteq \RP$ and there are randomized polynomial-time algorithms for NP-complete problems.

Ten-Year Cross-Disciplinary Comparison of the Growth of Open Access and How it Increases Research Citation Impact (C. Hajjem - 15 August, 2006)

We tested 1,307,038 articles published across 12 years (1992-2003) in 10 disciplines (Biology, Psychology, Sociology, Health, Political Science, Economics, Education, Law, Business, Management). A robot trawls the Web for full-texts using reference metadata ISI citation data (signal detectability d'=2.45; bias = 0.52). Percentage OA (relative to total OA + NOA) articles varies from 5%-16% (depending on discipline, year and country) and is slowly climbing annually (correlation r=.76, sample size N=12, probability p < 0.005). Comparing OA and NOA articles in the same journal/year, OA articles have consistently more citations, the advantage varying from 36%-172% by discipline and year. Comparing articles within six citation ranges (0, 1, 2-3, 4-7, 8-15, 16+ citations), the annual percentage of OA articles is growing significantly faster than NOA within every citation range (r > .90, N=12, p < .0005) and the effect is greater with the more highly cited articles (r = .98, N=6, p < .005). Causality cannot be determined from these data, but our prior finding of a similar pattern in physics, where percent OA is much higher (and even approaches 100% in some subfields), makes it unlikely that the OA citation advantage is merely or mostly a self-selection bias (for making only one's better articles OA)

A New Look at Survey Propagation and its Generalizations (Eliza N. Maneva - 30 October, 2005)
This paper provides a new conceptual perspective on survey propagation, which is an iterative algorithm recently introduced by the statistical physics community that is very effective in solving random k-SAT problems even with densities close to the satisfiability threshold. We then show that applying belief propagation--a well-known ``message-passing'' technique for estimating marginal probabilities--to this family of MRFs recovers a known family of algorithms, ranging from pure survey propagation at one extreme (Ï= 1) to standard belief propagation on the uniform distribution over SAT assignments at the other extreme (Ï= 0). This makes it necessary to study the structure of the space of partial assignments for Ï<1 and investigate the role of assignments that are very close to being cores. To that end, we investigate the associated lattice structure, and prove a weight-preserving identity that shows how any MRF with Ï>0 can be viewed as a ``smoothed'' version of the uniform distribution over satisfying assignments (Ï=0)

What are the technological and engineering implications and how these can be advantageously used to augment business intelligence, for example?

Hidden Physics Models: Machine Learning of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations (Maziar Raissi - 21 August, 2017)
In particular, we introduce \emph{hidden physics models}, which are essentially data-efficient learning machines capable of leveraging the underlying laws of physics, expressed by time dependent and nonlinear partial differential equations, to extract patterns from high-dimensional data generated from experiments. The methodology provides a promising new direction for harnessing the long-standing developments of classical methods in applied mathematics and mathematical physics to design learning machines with the ability to operate in complex domains without requiring large quantities of data.
