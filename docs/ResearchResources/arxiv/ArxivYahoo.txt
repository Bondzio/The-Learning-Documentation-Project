Towards a Context-Aware IDE-Based Meta Search Engine for Recommendation about Programming Errors and Exceptions (Mohammad Masudur Rahman - 6 July, 2018)
In this paper, we propose an Eclipse IDE-based web search solution that exploits the APIs provided by three popular web search engines-- Google, Yahoo, Bing and a popular programming Q & A site, Stack Overflow, and captures the content-relevance, context-relevance, popularity and search engine confidence of each candidate result against the encountered programming problems. Experiments with 75 programming errors and exceptions using the proposed approach show that inclusion of different types of context information associated with a given exception can enhance the recommendation accuracy of a given exception

An IDE-Based Context-Aware Meta Search Engine (Mohammad Masudur Rahman - 5 July, 2018)
In this paper, we propose an Eclipse IDE-based web search solution that collects the data from three web search APIs-- Google, Yahoo, Bing and a programming Q & A site-- Stack Overflow. Experiments with 25 run time errors and exceptions show that the proposed approach outperforms the keyword-based search approaches with a recommendation accuracy of 96%. We also validate the results with a user study involving five prospective participants where we get a result agreement of 64.28%

In Monte-Carlo simulations using distributions fitted to Yahoo data, we show that a modest pollution effect is sufficient to dramatically change the advertising rank order that yields the optimal advertising revenue for a search engine
