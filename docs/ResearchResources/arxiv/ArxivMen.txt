Gendered behavior as a disadvantage in open source software development (Balazs Vedres - 6 October, 2018)
We find that 84.5% of women's disadvantage (compared to men) in success and 34.8% of their disadvantage in survival are due to the female pattern of their behavior

Reassembling the English novel, 1789-1919 (Allen Riddell - 1 August, 2018)
The following are representative: How many writers made careers as novelists, Are there unacknowledged precursors or forgotten rivals to canonical authors, To what extent is a writer's critical or commercial success predictable from their social origins? In the last decade library digitization and the development of machine-readable datasets have improved the prospects for data-intensive literary history. This paper offers two analyses of bibliographic data concerning novels published in the British Isles after 1789. First, we estimate yearly rates of new novel publication between 1789 and 1919. Second, using titles of novels appearing between 1800 and 1829, we resolve a dispute concerning occupational gender segregation in novel subgenres. We show that the remarkable growth in the number of men novelists after 1815 was not concentrated in particular subgenres.

Discovery Radiomics via Deep Multi-Column Radiomic Sequencers for Skin Cancer Detection (Mohammad Javad Shafiee - 24 September, 2017)
While skin cancer is the most diagnosed form of cancer in men and women, with more cases diagnosed each year than all other cancers combined, sufficiently early diagnosis results in very good prognosis and as such makes early detection crucial. The discovered radiomic sequencer was tested against 9,152 biopsy-proven clinical images comprising of different skin cancers such as melanoma and basal cell carcinoma, and demonstrated sensitivity and specificity of 91% and 75%, respectively, thus achieving dermatologist-level performance and \break hence can be a powerful tool for assisting general practitioners and dermatologists alike in improving the efficiency, consistency, and accuracy of skin cancer diagnosis.

This game is trivial if the total number of tokens is odd as the Nim-sum could never be 0, or if both the number of tokens and the number of stacks are even, since a simple mimicking strategy results in a Nim-sum of 0 after each of the second player's moves

Introduction In our previous articles, we have studied the singularities of 17 th century English within the framework of a diachronic analysis thanks to syntactical and morphological graphs and thanks to the dictionaries we have compiled from a corpus that may be expanded overtime. Our early work was based on a limited corpus of English travel literature to Greece in the 17 th century. This article deals with a late seventeenth century text written by a woman philosopher and essayist, Mary Astell (1666--1731), considered as one of the first English feminists

Mean regional retinal thickness of 11 retinal layers were obtained by automatic three-dimensional diffusion-map-based method in 112 normal eyes of 76 Iranian subjects. The thickness map of central foveal area in layer 1, 3, and 4 displayed the minimum thickness (P<0.005 for all). Maximum thickness was observed in nasal to the fovea of layer 1 (P<0.001) and in a circular pattern in the parafoveal retinal area of layers 2, 3 and 4 and in central foveal area of layer 6 (P<0.001). Temporal and inferior quadrants of the total retinal thickness and most of other quadrants of layer 1 were significantly greater in the men than in the women. Surrounding eight sectors of total retinal thickness and a limited number of sectors in layer 1 and 4 significantly correlated with age

We find that the early epidemic starts in the heterosexual population and then grows mainly through MSM (Men having Sex with Men) contact. The epidemic exhibits a giant component which is shown to have degenerate chains of vertices and after 1989, diameters are larger than that expected by the equivalent configuration model graphs. In 1997 there is an significant increase in the detection rate from 73 to 256 detections/year covering mainly MSMs which results in a rapid increase of distances and diameters in the giant component.
