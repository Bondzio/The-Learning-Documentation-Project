Automatically identifying, counting, and describing wild animals in camera-trap images with deep learning (Mohammed Sadegh Norouzzadeh - 15 November, 2017)
We investigate the ability to automatically, accurately, and inexpensively collect such data, which could transform many fields of biology, ecology, and zoology into "big data" sciences. We train deep convolutional neural networks to identify, count, and describe the behaviors of 48 species in the 3.2-million-image Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our deep neural networks automatically identify animals with over 93.8% accuracy, and we expect that number to improve rapidly in years to come. More importantly, if our system classifies only images it is confident about, our system can automate animal identification for 99.3% of the data while still performing at the same 96.6% accuracy as that of crowdsourced teams of human volunteers, saving more than 8.4 years (at 40 hours per week) of human labeling effort (i.e
