First Experiments with Neural Translation of Informal to Formal Mathematics (Qingxiang Wang - 11 June, 2018)
We report on our experiments to train deep neural networks that automatically translate informalized LaTeX-written Mizar texts into the formal Mizar language. Our experiments show that our best performing model configurations are able to generate correct Mizar statements on 65.73\% of the inference data, with the union of all models covering 79.17\%

LivDet 2017 Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition 2017 (Valerio Mura - 14 March, 2018)
Fingerprint Presentation Attack Detection (FPAD) deals with distinguishing images coming from artificial replicas of the fingerprint characteristic, made up of materials like silicone, gelatine or latex, and images coming from alive fingerprints. Since from 2009, the Fingerprint Liveness Detection Competition (LivDet) aims to assess the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms according to a rigorous experimental protocol and, at the same time, a simple overview of the basic achievements. The positive, increasing trend of the participants number, which supports the success of this initiative, is confirmed even this year: 17 algorithms were submitted to the competition, with a larger involvement of companies and academies

Teaching Machines to Code: Neural Markup Generation with Visual Attention (Sumeet S. Singh - 15 June, 2018)
Applying sequence modeling and transduction techniques that have been very successful across modalities such as natural language, image, handwriting, speech and audio; we construct an image-to-markup model that learns to produce syntactically and semantically correct LaTeX markup code over 150 words long and achieves a BLEU score of 89%; improving upon the previous state-of-art for the Im2Latex problem

Multi-Scale Attention with Dense Encoder for Handwritten Mathematical Expression Recognition (Jianshu Zhang - 30 January, 2018)
To settle this problem, we utilize the attention based encoder-decoder model that recognizes mathematical expression images from two-dimensional layouts to one-dimensional LaTeX strings. Validated on the CROHME competition task, the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with an expression recognition accuracy of 52.8% on CROHME 2014 and 50.1% on CROHME 2016, by only using the official training dataset.
