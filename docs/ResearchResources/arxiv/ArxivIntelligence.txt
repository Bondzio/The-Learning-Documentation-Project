Uniform CSP Parameterized by Solution Size is in W[1] (Ruhollah Majdoddin - 9 October, 2018)
It also has applications in artificial intelligence. Uniform CSP restricted to some finite family of Boolean relations (thus with a bound on the arity of relations) can easily be placed in W[1]. Marx (2005) proved that any such problem is either W[1]-complete or fixed parameter tractable. (2005), such programs characterize W[1]. Our work builds upon the work of Cesati (2002), which, answering a longstanding open question, shows that parameterized Exact Weighted CNF is in W[1]. This problem is equivalent to uniform CSP restricted to a specific (infinite) family of Boolean relations, where a tuple is in a relation, if and only if the tuple has exactly one 1
