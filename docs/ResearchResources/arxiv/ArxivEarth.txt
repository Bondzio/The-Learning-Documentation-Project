30m resolution Global Annual Burned Area Mapping based on Landsat images and Google Earth Engine (Tengfei Long - 7 May, 2018)
By utilizing the huge catalog of satellite imagery as well as the high-performance computing capacity of Google Earth Engine, we proposed an automated pipeline for generating 30-meter resolution global-scale annual burned area map from time-series of Landsat images, and a novel 30-meter resolution global annual burned area map of 2015 (GABAM 2015) is released. GABAM 2015 consists of spatial extent of fires that occurred during 2015 and not of fires that occurred in previous years. Cross-comparison with recent Fire_cci version 5.0 BA product found a similar spatial distribution and a strong correlation ($R^2=0.74$) between the burned areas from the two products, although differences were found in specific land cover categories (particularly in agriculture land). Preliminary global validation showed the commission and omission error of GABAM 2015 are 13.17% and 30.13%, respectively.

Learning Spectral-Spatial-Temporal Features via a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network for Change Detection in Multispectral Imagery (Lichao Mou - 7 March, 2018)
Change detection is one of the central problems in earth observation and was extensively investigated over recent decades. In comparison with previous approaches to change detection, the proposed network architecture possesses three distinctive properties: 1) It is end-to-end trainable, in contrast to most existing methods whose components are separately trained or computed; 2) it naturally harnesses spatial information that has been proven to be beneficial to change detection task; 3) it is capable of adaptively learning the temporal dependency between multitemporal images, unlike most of algorithms that use fairly simple operation like image differencing or stacking

Stage 4 validation of the Satellite Image Automatic Mapper lightweight computer program for Earth observation Level 2 product generation, Part 2 Validation (Andrea Baraldi - 8 January, 2017)
The European Space Agency (ESA) defines an Earth Observation (EO) Level 2 product as a multispectral (MS) image corrected for geometric, atmospheric, adjacency and topographic effects, stacked with its scene classification map (SCM) whose legend includes quality layers such as cloud and cloud-shadow. No ESA EO Level 2 product has ever been systematically generated at the ground segment. To contribute toward filling an information gap from EO big sensory data to the ESA EO Level 2 product, a Stage 4 validation (Val) of an off the shelf Satellite Image Automatic Mapper (SIAM) lightweight computer program for prior knowledge based MS color naming was conducted by independent means. National Land Cover Data (NLCD) 2006 map. The previous Part 1 Theory provided the multidisciplinary background of a priori color naming. The present Part 2 Validation presents and discusses Stage 4 Val results collected from the test SIAM WELD map time series and the reference NLCD map by an original protocol for wall to wall thematic map quality assessment without sampling, where the test and reference map legends can differ in agreement with the Part 1. Conclusions are that the SIAM-WELD maps instantiate a Level 2 SCM product whose legend is the FAO Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) taxonomy at the Dichotomous Phase (DP) Level 1 vegetation/nonvegetation, Level 2 terrestrial/aquatic or superior LCCS level.

The morpho-topographic and cartographic analysis of the archaeological site Cornesti "Iarcuri", Timis County, Romania, using computer sciences methods (GIS and Remote Sensing techniques) (Dorel Micle - 9 June, 2009)
The archaeological site Cornesti "Iarcuri" is the largest earth fortification in Romania, made out of four concentric compounds, spreading over 1780 hectares. It is known since 1700, but it had only a few small attempts of systematic research, the fortress gained interest only after the publishing of some satellite images by Google Earth. Through our work we try not to date the site as this objective will be achieved only after completing the systematic excavations which started in 2007, but only to analyze the co-relationship with the environment.

Ten Blue Links on Mars (Charles L. A. Clarke - 20 October, 2016)
Is it possible to overcome orders-of-magnitude longer latency to provide a tolerable user experience on Mars? In this paper, we formulate the searching from Mars problem as a tradeoff between "effort" (waiting for responses from Earth) and "data transfer" (pre-fetching or caching data on Mars). We intend for this research problem to be aspirational and inspirational - even if one is not convinced by the premise of Mars colonization, there are Earth-based scenarios such as searching from a rural village in India that share similar constraints, thus making the problem worthy of exploration and attention from researchers.
