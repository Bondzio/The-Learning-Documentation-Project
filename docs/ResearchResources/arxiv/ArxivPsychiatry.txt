Classification of Major Depressive Disorder via Multi-Site Weighted LASSO Model (Dajiang Zhu - 3 June, 2017)
Large-scale collaborative analysis of brain imaging data, in psychiatry and neu-rology, offers a new source of statistical power to discover features that boost ac-curacy in disease classification, differential diagnosis, and outcome prediction. In tests on da-ta from five sites (299 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 258 normal controls), our method boosted classification accuracy for MDD by 4.9% on average

Computing Scalable Multivariate Glocal Invariants of Large (Brain-) Graphs (Disa Mhembere - 16 December, 2013)
To explore the variability of connectomes---to address both basic science questions regarding the structure of the brain, and medical health questions about psychiatry and neurology---one can study the topological properties of these brain-graphs. As a demonstration, we run our code on 120 brain-graphs, each with approximately 16M vertices and up to 90M edges.

The landscape of NeuroImage-ing research (Jordan D. Dworkin - 8 June, 2018)
Using node-level analysis, we quantify the structural roles of individual topics within the neuroimaging landscape, and find high levels of clustering within the structural MRI subfield as well as increasing participation among topics related to psychiatry

Emotional Intensity analysis in Bipolar subjects (Facundo Carrillo - 7 June, 2016)
These results sumed to previous studies show that current automated speech analysis is capable of identifying altered mental states towards a quantitative psychiatry.

A Gesture Recognition System for Detecting Behavioral Patterns of ADHD (Miguel Ãngel Bautista - 5 November, 2014)
This methodology is applied in a clinical context, detecting a group of ADHD behavioural patterns defined by experts in psychology/psychiatry, to provide support to clinicians in the diagnose procedure. We obtain satisfying results when compared to standard state-of-the-art approaches in the DTW context.
