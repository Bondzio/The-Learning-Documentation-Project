We implemented a fast Reciprocal Monte Carlo algorithm, to accurately solve radiative heat transfer in turbulent flows of non-grey participating media that can be coupled to fully resolved turbulent flows, namely to Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS). By implementing the proposed algorithmic accelerations, a speed-up of up to 3 orders of magnitude can be achieved, while maintaining the same accuracy.

Model Agnostic Saliency for Weakly Supervised Lesion Detection from Breast DCE-MRI (Gabriel Maicas - 23 July, 2018)
There is a heated debate on how to interpret the decisions provided by deep learning models (DLM), where the main approaches rely on the visualization of salient regions to interpret the DLM classification process. However, these approaches generally fail to satisfy three conditions for the problem of lesion detection from medical images: 1) for images with lesions, all salient regions should represent lesions, 2) for images containing no lesions, no salient region should be produced,and 3) lesions are generally small with relatively smooth borders

Classification of Household Materials via Spectroscopy (Zackory Erickson - 15 May, 2018)
Recognizing an object's material can inform a robot on how hard it may grasp the object during manipulation, or if the object may be safely heated up. To illustrate this, we collected a dataset of spectral measurements from two commercially available spectrometers during which a robotic platform interacted with 50 distinct objects, and we show that a residual neural network can accurately analyze these measurements. Due to the low variance in consecutive spectral measurements, our model achieved a material classification accuracy of 97.7% when given only one spectral sample per object. Similar to prior works with haptic sensors, we found that generalizing material recognition to new objects posed a greater challenge, for which we achieved an accuracy of 81.4% via leave-one-object-out cross-validation

We proposes to exploit stranded power, renewable energy that has no value to the power grid, for scaling supercomputers, Zero-Carbon Cloud (ZCCloud), and showing that stranded power can be employed effectively to expand computing [1]. The ZCCloud approach reduces TCO by 21-45%, and improves cost-effectiveness up to 34%. With higher power price, cheaper computing hardware and higher system power density, benefits rise to 55%, 97% and 116% respectively. Finally, we study future extreme-scale systems, showing that beyond terascale, projected power requirements in excess of 100MW make ZCCloud up to 45% lower cost, for a fixed budget, increase peak PFLOPS achievable by 80%.

Robust Energy-Constrained Frequency Reserves from Aggregations of Commercial Buildings (Evangelos Vrettos - 17 June, 2015)
It has been shown that the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems of commercial buildings can offer ancillary services to power systems without loss of comfort. We use a hierarchical approach with three levels: (i) reserve capacities are allocated among buildings (e.g., on a daily basis) using techniques from robust optimization, (ii) a robust model predictive controller optimizes the HVAC system consumption typically every 30 minutes, and (iii) a feedback controller adjusts the consumption to provide reserves in real time. Our results show that an aggregation of approximately 100 buildings suffices to meet the 5 MW minimum bid size of the Swiss reserve market.

Data Driven Energy Efficiency in Buildings (Nipun Batra - 2 September, 2014)
In addition to smart meters, buildings are also increasingly managed with Building Management Systems (BMS) which control different sub-systems such as lighting and heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC). Picking from wide literature in building energy efficiency, we identify five crust areas (also referred to as 5 Is) for realizing data driven energy efficiency in buildings : i) instrument optimally; ii) interconnect sub-systems; iii) inferred decision making; iv) involve occupants and v) intelligent operations. We classify prior work as per these 5 Is and dis-cuss challenges, opportunities and applications across them. Building upon these 5 Is we discuss a well studied problem in building energy efficiency -non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) and how research in this area spans across the 5 Is.

Evaluation of the thermal and hydraulic performances of a very thin sintered copper flat heat pipe for 3D microsystem packages (S. Tzanova - 21 February, 2008)
The results are presented in terms of liquid and vapour pressures within the heat pipe. The simulated results are validated by experiments and proved that the method can be further used to predict thermal performance of the heat pipe and to optimise its design.

Enhanced Sensing Characteristics in MEMS-based Formaldehyde Gas Sensor (Yu-Hsiang Wang - 21 February, 2008)
This study has successfully demonstrated a novel self-heating formaldehyde gas sensor based on a thin film of NiO sensing layer. A new fabrication process has been developed in which the Pt micro heater and electrodes are deposited directly on the substrate and the NiO thin film is deposited above on the micro heater to serve as sensing layer

Set-up and characterization of a humidity sensor realized in LTCC-technology (W. Smetana - 21 February, 2008)
In this approach, sensing elements are implemented using heated metal resistors (Pt-elements), where one is exposed to the humid environment that causes the sensor element to cool down with increased humidity, while the other one is sealed from the environment

A statistical mechanical interpretation of algorithmic information theory (Kohtaro Tadaki - 28 January, 2008)
We develop a statistical mechanical interpretation of algorithmic information theory by introducing the notion of thermodynamic quantities, such as free energy, energy, statistical mechanical entropy, and specific heat, into algorithmic information theory
