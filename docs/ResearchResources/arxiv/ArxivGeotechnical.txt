A computational toy model for shallow landslides: Molecular Dynamics approach (Gianluca Martelloni - 30 August, 2012)
The latter static condition is used in the geotechnical model to estimate the possibility of landslide triggering. Finally it is possible to apply the method of the inverse surface displacement velocity [Fukuzono 1985] for predicting the failure time.

An evaluation of the osmotic method of controlling suction (Pierre Delage - 9 March, 2008)
Various applications to geotechnical testing are presented such as the determination of the water retention curve, oedometer and triaxial testing procedures and the determination of the permeability of unsaturated soils. Recent developments, that include the extension of the method up to high suctions (10 MPa) are also described, together with some recent and novel applications such as data from high controlled suction oedometer compression test and the determination of the oil/water retention properties of oil reservoir chalks.
