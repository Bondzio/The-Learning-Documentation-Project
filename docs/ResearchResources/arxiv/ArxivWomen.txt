Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer and leading cancer-related death causes for women. In the context of ICIAR 2018 Grand Challenge on Breast Cancer Histology Images, we compare one handcrafted feature extractor and five transfer learning feature extractors based on deep learning. The best feature extractor achieves an average accuracy of 79.30%. When the five deep learning feature groups are combined, the average accuracy is improved to 82.90% (best accuracy 85.00%).

SD-CNN: a Shallow-Deep CNN for Improved Breast Cancer Diagnosis (Fei Gao - 1 March, 2018)
However it demonstrates limited sensitivity for women with dense breasts. To evaluate the validity of our approach, we first develop a deep-CNN using 49 CEDM cases collected from Mayo Clinic to prove the contributions from recombined images for improved breast cancer diagnosis (0.86 in accuracy using LE imaging vs. 0.90 in accuracy using both LE and recombined imaging). We then develop a shallow-CNN using the same 49 CEDM cases to learn the nonlinear mapping from LE to recombined images. Next, we use 69 DM cases collected from the hospital located at Zhejiang University, China to generate "virtual" recombined images. Using DM alone provides 0.91 in accuracy, whereas SD-CNN improves the diagnostic accuracy to 0.95.

A comparative study of breast surface reconstruction for aesthetic outcome assessment (Rene Lacher - 20 June, 2017)
Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer type in women, and while its survival rate is generally high the aesthetic outcome is an increasingly important factor when evaluating different treatment alternatives. We present results from 28 synthetic and clinical RGBD sequences, including 12 unique patients and an anthropomorphic phantom demonstrating the applicability of low-cost RGBD sensors to real clinical cases. Although these should be addressed appropriately if higher model quality is warranted, we observe that low-cost sensors are able to obtain valuable reconstructions comparable to the state-of-the-art within an error margin of 3 mm.

When both men and women have strict preferences over the opposite group, all stable matchings have the same cardinality, and the famous Gale-Shapley algorithm can be used to find one

On Sisterhood in the Gale-Shapley Matching Algorithm (Yannai A. Gonczarowski - 19 December, 2011)
Lying in order to manipulate the Gale-Shapley matching algorithm has been studied by Dubins and Friedman and by Gale and Sotomayor and was shown to be generally more appealing to the proposed-to side (denoted as the women in Gale and Shapley's original paper) than to the proposing side (denoted as men there). It can also be shown that in the case of lying women, for every woman who is better-off due to lying, there exists a man who is worse-off.

Stable marriage problems with quantitative preferences (Maria Silvia Pini - 29 July, 2010)
The stable marriage problem is a well-known problem of matching men to women so that no man and woman, who are not married to each other, both prefer each other. In the classical stable marriage problem, both men and women express a strict preference order over the members of the other sex, in a qualitative way

Local search for stable marriage problems (M. Gelain - 6 July, 2010)
In the classical formulation, n men and n women express their preferences (via a strict total order) over the members of the other sex. We consider both the classical stable marriage problem and one of its useful variations (denoted SMTI) where the men and women express their preferences in the form of an incomplete preference list with ties over a subset of the members of the other sex
