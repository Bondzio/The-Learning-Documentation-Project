Ab initio phase diagram of PbSe crystals calculated with the Random Phase Approximation (Tobias SchÃ¤fer - 30 July, 2018)
Understanding the phase behavior of semiconductor materials is important for applications in solid state physics and nanoscience. At room temperature, we find transition pressures of 4.6 +/- 0.3 GPa for the B1-B33 transition and 18.7 +/- 0.3 GPa for the B33-B2 transition, in good agreement with experiments

Discrete Electronic Sub-bands without Confinement: Bragg Scattering at Molecular Edges (Alberto MartÃ­n-JimÃ©nez - 5 October, 2018)
The discretization of the electronic structure of nanometer-size solid systems due to quantum confinement and the concomitant modification of their physical properties is one of the cornerstones for the development of Nanoscience and Nanotechnology. In this letter we demonstrate that Bragg scattering of Cu(111) surface state electrons by the periodic arrangement of tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) molecules at the edges of self-assembled molecular islands, discretizes the possible values of the electron momentum parallel to the island edge

Writing on Nanocrystals: Patterning Colloidal Inorganic Nanocrystal Films through Irradiation-Induced Chemical Transformations of Surface Ligands (Francisco Palazon - 5 January, 2018)
In the past couple of decades, colloidal inorganic nanocrystals and, more specifically, semiconductor quantum dots have emerged as crucial materials for the development of nanoscience and nanotechnology, with applications in very diverse areas such as optoelectronics and biotechnology. A few reports from the late 1990 and early 2000 used such direct lithography to fabricate electrical wires from metallic NCs. In the early 2010, the same method was used to define fluorescent patterns on QD films, allowing for further applications in biosensing. For the past 2 ,3 years, direct lithography on NC films with e-beams and X rays has gone through an important development as it has been demonstrated that it can tune further transformations on the NCs, leading to more complex patternings and opening a whole new set of possible applications.

Tuning the Dirac Cone of Bilayer and Bulk Structure Graphene by Intercalating First Row Transition Metals using First Principles Calculations (Srimanta Pakhira - 22 November, 2017)
Modern nanoscience has focused on two-dimensional (2D) layer structure materials which have garnered tremendous attention due to their unique physical, chemical and electronic properties since the discovery of graphene in 2004. Using first-principles DFT techniques, we have designed 20 new materials \textit{in-silico} by intercalating first row transition metals (TMs) with BLG, i.e. 10 layered structure and 10 bulk crystal structures of TM intercalated in BLG. The present DFT calculations show that the 2$p_z$ sub-shells of C atoms in graphene and the 3$d_{yz}$ sub-shells of the TM atoms provide the electron density near the Fermi level controlling the material properties of the BLG-intercalated materials

Mid-infrared directional surface waves on a high aspect ratio nano-trench platform (Osamu Takayama - 20 April, 2017)
Optical surface waves, highly localized modes bound to the surface of media, enable manipulation of light at nanoscale, thus impacting a wide range of areas in nanoscience. The surface waves exhibit a unique combination of properties, such as directionality, broadband existence (from 4 Î¼m to at least 14 Î¼m and beyond) and high localization, making them an attractive tool for effective control of light in an extended range of infrared frequencies.

Mechanics of an Asymmetric Hard--Soft Lamellar Nanomaterial (Weichao Shi - 31 January, 2017)
Nanolayered lamellae are common structures in nanoscience and nanotechnology, but most are nearly symmetric in layer thickness. Here, we report on the structure and mechanics of highly asymmetric and thermodynamically stable soft--hard lamellar structures self-assembled from optimally designed PS1-(PI-b-PS2)3 miktoarm star block copolymers. The remarkable mechanical properties of these strong and ductile PS (polystyrene)-based nanomaterials can be tuned over a broad range by varying the hard layer thickness while maintaining the soft layer thickness constant at 13 nm. Upon deformation, thin PS lamellae (\textless{}100 nm) exhibited kinks and predamaged/damaged grains, as well as cavitation in the soft layers. In contrast, deformation of thick lamellae (\textgreater{}100 nm) manifests cavitation in both soft and hard nanolayers

Quantitative Chemically-Specific Coherent Diffractive Imaging of Buried Interfaces using a Tabletop EUV Nanoscope (Elisabeth R. Shanblatt - 3 March, 2016)
Characterizing buried layers and interfaces is critical for a host of applications in nanoscience and nano-manufacturing. Copper nanostructures inlaid in SiO2 are coated with 100 nm of aluminum, which is opaque to visible light and thick enough that neither optical microscopy nor atomic force microscopy can image the buried interfaces. Short wavelength (29 nm) high harmonic light can penetrate the aluminum layer, yielding high-contrast images of the buried structures

Nanoscale phase-engineering of thermal transport with a Josephson heat modulator (Antonio Fornieri - 28 October, 2015)
The ability to master the amount of heat transferred through two tunnel-coupled superconductors by tuning their phase difference is the core of coherent caloritronics [4-6], and is expected to be a key tool in a number of nanoscience fields, including solid state cooling [7], thermal isolation [8, 9], radiation detection [7], quantum information [10, 11] and thermal logic [12]. Here we show the realization of the first balanced Josephson heat modulator [13] designed to offer full control at the nanoscale over the phase-coherent component of thermal currents. Our device provides magnetic-flux-dependent temperature modulations up to 40 mK in amplitude with a maximum of the flux-to-temperature transfer coefficient reaching 200 mK per flux quantum at a bath temperature of 25 mK. Foremost, it demonstrates the exact correspondence in the phase-engineering of charge and heat currents, breaking ground for advanced caloritronic nanodevices such as thermal splitters [14], heat pumps [15] and time-dependent electronic engines [16-19].

Electron tomography at 2.4 Ã resolution (M. C. Scott - 5 February, 2012)
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is a powerful imaging tool that has found broad application in materials science, nanoscience and biology(1-3). With the introduction of aberration-corrected electron lenses, both the spatial resolution and image quality in TEM have been significantly improved(4,5) and resolution below 0.5 Ã has been demonstrated(6). Recently, discrete tomography has been used to generate a 3D atomic reconstruction of a silver nanoparticle 2-3 nm in diameter(12), but this statistical method assumes prior knowledge of the particle's lattice structure and requires that the atoms fit rigidly on that lattice. By combining a novel projection alignment and tomographic reconstruction method with scanning transmission electron microscopy, we have determined the 3D structure of a ~10 nm gold nanoparticle at 2.4 Ã resolution

We find three collaboration modes that correspond to three distinct ranges in the distribution of collaborators: (1) for authors with fewer than 20 collaborators (the majority) preferential attachment does not hold and they form a log-normal "hook" instead of a power law, (2) authors with more than 20 collaborators benefit from preferential attachment and form a power law tail, and (3) authors with between 250 and 800 collaborators are more frequent than expected because of the hyperauthorship practices in certain subfields.
