Highrisk Prediction from Electronic Medical Records via Deep Attention Networks (You Jin Kim - 30 November, 2017)
Here we propose deep attention models that predict the onset of the high risky vascular disease from symbolic medical histories sequence of hypertension patients such as ICD-10 and pharmacy codes only, Medical History-based Prediction using Attention Network (MeHPAN). We demonstrate two types of attention models based on 1) bidirectional gated recurrent unit (R-MeHPAN) and 2) 1D convolutional multilayer model (C-MeHPAN)

Electronic Prescription System for Pediatricians (Adebayo Omotosho - 5 July, 2017)
The resulting prescription is marked with verifiable randomly generated prescription ID before it is sent to the dispensing pharmacy and this accounts for the security feature of the prescription system. Microsoft Office Visio 2007, PHP and My SQL database server were used to present and develop the system

Evaluating Link-Based Techniques for Detecting Fake Pharmacy Websites (Ahmed Abbasi - 27 September, 2013)
Fake online pharmacies have become increasingly pervasive, constituting over 90% of online pharmacy websites. In this study, we compared several well-known link-based detection techniques on a large-scale test bed with the hyperlink graph encompassing over 80 million links between 15.5 million web pages, including 1.2 million known legitimate and fake pharmacy pages. We found that the QoC and QoL class propagation algorithms achieved an accuracy of over 90% on our dataset

Use of semantic technologies for the development of a dynamic trajectories generator in a Semantic Chemistry eLearning platform (Richard Huber - 7 December, 2010)
ChemgaPedia is a multimedia, webbased eLearning service platform that currently contains about 18.000 pages organized in 1.700 chapters covering the complete bachelor studies in chemistry and related topics of chemistry, pharmacy, and life sciences. The eLearning encyclopedia contains some 25.000 media objects and the eLearning platform provides services such as virtual and remote labs for experiments. With up to 350.000 users per month the platform is the most frequently used scientific educational service in the German spoken Internet

ChemCloud: Chemical e-Science Information Cloud (Alexandru Todor - 7 December, 2010)
Our Chemical e-Science Information Cloud (ChemCloud) - a Semantic Web based eScience infrastructure - integrates and automates a multitude of databases, tools and services in the domain of chemistry, pharmacy and bio-chemistry available at the Fachinformationszentrum Chemie (FIZ Chemie), at the Freie Universitaet Berlin (FUB), and on the public Web. Based on the approach of the W3C Linked Open Data initiative and the W3C Semantic Web technologies for ontologies and rules it semantically links and integrates knowledge from our W3C HCLS knowledge base hosted at the FUB, our multi-domain knowledge base DBpedia (Deutschland) implemented at FUB, which is extracted from Wikipedia (De) providing a public semantic resource for chemistry, and our well-established databases at FIZ Chemie such as ChemInform for organic reaction data, InfoTherm the leading source for thermophysical data, Chemisches Zentralblatt, the complete chemistry knowledge from 1830 to 1969, and ChemgaPedia the largest and most frequented e-Learning platform for Chemistry and related sciences in German language.

Identifying roles of clinical pharmacy with survey evaluation (Andreja Äufar - 17 June, 2014)
With OrdEval algorithm we first evaluate the importance of competences for the users of clinical pharmacy and extract their nature according to the users expectations. Next, we build a model for predicting a successful introduction of clinical pharmacy to the clinical departments

The impact of pharmacybernetic in reducing medication error (Muhammad Shahzad Aslam - 8 May, 2012)
The authors examined the comprehensive project of implementing Electronic Drug Information Record (EDIR), introduce the new term Pharmacybernetic and how to reduce the medication error by integrated management system (IMS). This paper presented EDIR conceptual model and the flow sheet of the Pharmacybernetic system, which describes the integration of different Pharmaceutical related aspect in the field of Cybernetic.
