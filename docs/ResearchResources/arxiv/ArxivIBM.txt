Optimization of Circuits for IBM's five-qubit Quantum Computers (Gerhard W. Dueck - 28 September, 2018)
IBM has made several quantum computers available to researchers around the world via cloud services. Two architectures with five qubits, one with 16, and one with 20 qubits are available to run experiments. In this paper, we show how Clifford+T circuits can efficiently be mapped into the two IBM quantum computers with 5 qubits

On the influence of forced homogeneous-isotropic turbulence on the settling and clustering of finite-size particles (Agathe Chouippe - 11 September, 2018)
We investigate the motion of heavy particles with a diameter of several multiples of the Kolmogorov length scale in the presence of forced turbulence and gravity, resorting to interface-resolved DNS based on an IBM. The values of the particles' relative density (1.5) and of the Galileo number (180) are such that strong wake-induced particle clustering would occur in the absence of turbulence. The forced turbulence in the two present cases (with Taylor-scale Reynolds number 95 and 140) would lead to mild levels of clustering in the absence of gravity

Quartet structure of $N=Z$ nuclei in a boson formalism: the case of $^{28}$Si (M. Sambataro - 5 September, 2018)
The structure of the $N=Z$ nucleus $^{28}$Si is studied by resorting to an IBM-type formalism with $s$ and $d$ bosons representing isospin $T=0$ and angular momentum $J=0$ and $J=2$ quartets, respectively. An analysis of the potential energy surface places $^{28}$Si, only known case so far, at the critical point of the U(5)-$\overline{\rm SU(3)}$ transition of the IBM structural diagram.

Distinguishing Unitary Gates on the IBM Quantum Processor (Shusen Liu - 1 July, 2018)
In this paper, we implement such a task on IBM's quantum processor. More precisely, we experimentally demonstrate the discrimination of two qubit unitary gates, the identity gate and the $\frac{2}{3}Ï$-phase shift gate, using two discrimination schemes -- the parallel scheme and the sequential scheme. We program these two schemes on the \emph{ibmqx4}, a $5$-qubit superconducting quantum processor via IBM cloud, with the help of the $QSI$ modules [S. Liu et al.,~arXiv:1710.09500, 2017].

Heavy-ion double-charge-exchange and its relation to neutrinoless double-beta decay (E. Santopinto - 27 June, 2018)
By making use of the Interacting Boson Model (IBM) formalism, we also show that the DGT and total parts of the neutrinoless double-beta decay NMEs are in linear correlation with DCE-DGT NMEs. This confirms the hypothesis of a linear correlation between them, as introduced in [Phys.\ Rev.\ Lett.\ {\bf 120}, 142502 (2018)]. The possibility of a Two-Step Factorization (TSF) of the very forward differential DCE-cross-section and the emergence of DGT and DF types for the DCE nuclear matrix elements, combined with a linear correlation between DCE-DGT and 0$Î½Î²Î²$ NMEs, opens the possibility of placing an upper limit on neutrinoless double-beta decay NMEs in terms of the DCE experimental data at $Î¸=0^\circ$.

Shape coexistence close to $N=50$ in the neutron-rich isotope $^{80}$Ge investigated by IBM-2 (Dali Zhang - 2 January, 2018)
The properties of the low-lying states, especially the relevant shape coexistence in $^{80}$Ge close to one of most neutron-rich doubly magic nuclei at $N=50$ and $Z=28$ have been investigated within the framework of the proton-neutron interacting model (IBM-2).

Fast dose optimization for rotating shield brachytherapy (Myung Cho - 19 April, 2017)
Treatment plans were generated for all patients using the POGS method and the previously considered commercial solver IBM CPLEX. The H-RSBT applicator has 6 helices, with 33.3 mm of translation along the applicator per helical rotation and 1.7 mm spacing between dwell positions, yielding 17.5 degree emission angle spacing per 5 mm along the applicator.// Results: For each patient, HR-CTV D90, HR-CTV D100, rectum D2cc, sigmoid D2cc, and bladder D2cc matched within 1% for CPLEX and POGS. POGS was around 18 times faster than CPLEX. // Conclusions: POGS substantially reduced treatment plan optimization time around 18 times for RSBT with similar HR-CTV D90, OAR D2cc values, and EQD2 figure relative to CPLEX, which is significant progress toward clinical translation of RSBT

The IBM 2016 Speaker Recognition System (Seyed Omid Sadjadi - 23 February, 2016)
In this paper we describe the recent advancements made in the IBM i-vector speaker recognition system for conversational speech. The techniques include: 1) a nearest-neighbor discriminant analysis (NDA) approach that is formulated to alleviate some of the limitations associated with the conventional linear discriminant analysis (LDA) that assumes Gaussian class-conditional distributions, 2) the application of speaker- and channel-adapted features, which are derived from an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system, for speaker recognition, and 3) the use of a deep neural network (DNN) acoustic model with a large number of output units (~10k senones) to compute the frame-level soft alignments required in the i-vector estimation process. We evaluate these techniques on the NIST 2010 speaker recognition evaluation (SRE) extended core conditions involving telephone and microphone trials. Experimental results indicate that: 1) the NDA is more effective (up to 35% relative improvement in terms of EER) than the traditional parametric LDA for speaker recognition, 2) when compared to raw acoustic features (e.g., MFCCs), the ASR speaker-adapted features provide gains in speaker recognition performance, and 3) increasing the number of output units in the DNN acoustic model (i.e., increasing the senone set size from 2k to 10k) provides consistent improvements in performance (for example from 37% to 57% relative EER gains over our baseline GMM i-vector system). To our knowledge, results reported in this paper represent the best performances published to date on the NIST SRE 2010 extended core tasks.

Conversion of Artificial Recurrent Neural Networks to Spiking Neural Networks for Low-power Neuromorphic Hardware (Peter U. Diehl - 16 January, 2016)
We demonstrate our approach by mapping a natural language processing task (question classification), where we demonstrate the entire mapping process of the recurrent layer of the network on IBM's Neurosynaptic System "TrueNorth", a spike-based digital neuromorphic hardware architecture. To satisfy these constraints, it was necessary to discretize the synaptic weights and neural activities to 16 levels, and to limit fan-in to 64 inputs. The hardware-constrained model achieved 74% accuracy in question classification while using less than 0.025% of the cores on one TrueNorth chip, resulting in an estimated power consumption of ~17 uW.

The ASIC has been fabricated using the IBM-8RF 0.13 micron CMOS process. On each of 6 analog channels, PSEC4 employs a switched capacitor array (SCA) 256 samples deep, a ramp-compare ADC with 10.5 bits of DC dynamic range, and a serial data readout with the capability of region-of-interest windowing to reduce dead time. The sampling rate can be adjusted between 4 and 15 Gigasamples/second [GSa/s] on all channels and is servo-controlled on-chip with a low-jitter delay-locked loop (DLL). The input signals are passively coupled on-chip with a -3 dB analog bandwidth of 1.5 GHz. The power consumption in quiescent sampling mode is less than 50 mW/chip; at a sustained trigger and readout rate of 50 kHz the chip draws 100 mW. After fixed-pattern pedestal subtraction, the uncorrected integral non-linearity is 0.15% over an 750 mV dynamic range. With a linearity correction, a full 1 V signal voltage range is available.The sampling timebase has a fixed-pattern non-linearity with an RMS of 13%, which can be corrected for precision waveform feature extraction and timing.

Shape evolution and the role of intruder configurations in Hg isotopes within the interacting boson model based on a Gogny energy density functional (K. Nomura - 7 June, 2013)
Excitation energies, electromagnetic transition rates, deformation properties, and ground-state properties of the $^{172-204}$Hg nuclei are obtained by mapping the microscopic deformation energy surface onto the equivalent IBM Hamiltonian in the boson condensate. These results point to the overall systematic trend of the transition from the near spherical vibrational state in lower-mass Hg nuclei close to $^{172}$Hg, onset of intruder prolate configuration as well as the manifest prolate-oblate shape coexistence around the mid-shell nucleus $^{184}$Hg, weakly oblate deformed structure beyond $^{190}$Hg up to the spherical vibrational structure toward the near semi-magic nucleus $^{204}$Hg, as observed experimentally

Triaxial Shapes in the Interacting Vector Boson Model (H. G. Ganev - 22 November, 2011)
The $SU^{\ast}(3)$ algebra considered in the present paper closely resembles many properties of the $SU^{\ast}(3)$ limit of IBM-2, which have been shown by many authors geometrically to correspond to the rigid triaxial model. The influence of different types of perturbations on the $SU^{\ast}(3)$ energy surface, in particular the addition of a Majorana interaction and an O(6) term to the model Hamiltonian, is studied. Using a schematic Hamiltonian which possesses a perturbed $SU^{\ast}(3)$ dynamical symmetry, the theory is applied for the calculation of the low-lying energy spectrum of the nucleus $^{192}$Os. The theoretical results obtained agree reasonably with the experimental data and show a very shallow triaxial minimum in the energy surface for the ground state in $^{192}$Os, suggesting that the newly proposed dynamical symmetry might be appropriate for the description of the collective properties of different nuclei, exhibiting triaxial features.

This work is the natural extension of the work presented in [1] for the E(5)-models. For that purpose, a quite general one- and two-body IBM Hamiltonian is used and a numerical fit to the different X(5)-models energies is performed, later on the obtained wave functions are used to calculate B(E2) transition rates. It is shown that within the IBM one can reproduce well the results for energies and B(E2) transition rates obtained with all these X(5)-models, although the agreement is not so impressive as for the E(5)-models. From the fitted IBM parameters the corresponding energy surface can be extracted and it is obtained that, surprisingly, only the X(5) case corresponds in the moderate large N limit to an energy surface very close to the one expected for a critical point, while the rest of models seat a little farther.

By analyzing the potential energy surface, the shape phase diagram and the energy spectrum of the nucleus in U(5) symmetry in the IBM, we propose that the U(5) symmetry with parameters $(A+B) < 0$ may be a model to describe the rotation driven vibrational to axially rotational phase transition along the yrast line

Long-range interactions & parallel scalability in molecular simulations (Michael Patra - 21 June, 2006)
We have employed the GROMACS simulation package to perform extensive benchmarking of different commonly used electrostatic schemes on a range of computer architectures (Pentium-4, IBM Power 4, and Apple/IBM G5) for single processor and parallel performance up to 8 nodes - we have also tested the scalability on four different networks, namely Infiniband, GigaBit Ethernet, Fast Ethernet, and nearly uniform memory architecture, i.e., communication between CPUs is possible by directly reading from or writing to other CPUs' local memory. Lipid bilayers of sizes 128, 512 and 2048 lipid molecules were used as the test systems representing typical cases encountered in biomolecular simulations

Parallelization of a treecode (R. Valdarnini - 18 March, 2003)
For a configuration with a constant number of particles per processor the scalability of the code was tested up to P=128 processors on an IBM SP4 machine. In the large $P$ limit the average CPU time per processor necessary for solving the gravitational interactions is $\sim 10 %$ higher than that expected from the ideal scaling relation. The results of the numerical tests show that the load balancing efficiency $L$ of the code is high ($>=90%$) up to P=32, and decreases to $L\sim 80%$ when P=128. In the latter case it is found that some aspects of the code performance are affected by machine hardware, while the proposed weighting scheme can achieve a load balance as high as $L\sim 90%$ even in the large $P$ limit.

Spectroscopic calculations of the low-lying structure in exotic Os and W isotopes (K. Nomura - 19 April, 2011)
Structural evolution in neutron-rich Os and W isotopes is investigated in terms of the Interacting Boson Model (IBM) Hamiltonian determined by (constrained) Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) calculations with the Gogny-D1S Energy Density Functional (EDF). The interaction strengths of the IBM Hamiltonian are produced by mapping the potential energy surface (PES) of the Gogny-EDF with quadrupole degrees of freedom onto the corresponding PES of the IBM system

Modeling Dengue Outbreaks (Marcelo J Otero - 6 December, 2010)

We finally show that the IBM model introduced is precisely a realization of a compartmental model, and that at least in this case, the choice between compartmental models or IBM is only a matter of convenience.

Parameter Inference for an Individual Based Model of Chytridiomycosis in Frogs (Leah R. Johnson - 9 November, 2010)

We show that if the IBM satisfies certain criteria we can find the likelihood (or posterior) analytically, and use standard computational techniques, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), for parameter inference.
