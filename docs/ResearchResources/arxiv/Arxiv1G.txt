The Hubble Space Telescope UV Legacy Survey of Galactic Globular Clusters. XVI. The helium abundance of multiple populations (A. P. Milone - 13 September, 2018)
We compare multi-wavelength HST photometry with synthetic spectra to determine for the first time the average helium difference between the 2G and 1G stars in a large sample of 57 GCs and the maximum helium variation within each of them. The maximum helium variation ranges from less than 0.01 to more than 0.10 in helium mass fraction and correlates with both the cluster mass and the color extension of the horizontal branch (HB)

First-principles prediction of phonon-mediated superconductivity in XBC (X= Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba) (Enamul Haque - 30 September, 2018)
The strong attractive interaction between $Ï$-bonding electrons and the B${_{1g}}$ phonon mode gives rise to a larger electron-phonon coupling constant (1.135) and hence high $T_c$; notably, higher than that of MgB$_2$

Electronic and Vibrational Properties of PbI 2 : From Bulk to Monolayer (Mehmet Yagmurcukardes - 24 July, 2018)
Moreover, the Raman activity of the A 1g mode significantly increases with increasing number of layers due to the enhanced out-of-plane dielectric constant in the few-layer case. We further characterize rigid-layer vibrations of low-frequency inter-layer shear (C) and breathing (LB) modes in few-layer PbI 2 . A reduced mono-atomic (linear) chain model (LCM) provides a fairly accurate picture of the number of layers dependence of the low-frequency modes and it is shown also to be a powerful tool to study the inter-layer coupling strength in layered PbI 2 .

Bond versus charge disproportionation in the bismuth perovskites (Arash Khazraie - 18 July, 2018)
In the BD system, we estimate an effective attractive interaction $U$ between holes on the same O-a$_{1g}$ molecular orbital. Although here we concentrate on the example of the bismuthates, the basic ideas can be directly transferred to other perovskites with negative charge-transfer energy, like ReNiO$_{3}$ (Re: rare-earth element), Ca(Sr)FeO$_{3}$, CsTIF$_{3}$ and CsTlCl$_{3}$.

Femtosecond phase-transition in hard x-ray excited bismuth (M. Makita - 19 July, 2018)
The evolution of the bismuth crystal structure upon excitation of its A$_{1g}$ phonon has been intensely studied with short pulse optical lasers. Here we present the first-time observation of a hard x-ray induced ultrafast phase transition in a bismuth single crystal, at high intensities (~$10^{14}$ W/cm$^2$). The time evolution of the (111) Bragg peak intensity showed strong dependence on the excitation fluence

Interplay of lattice, electronic and spin degrees of freedom in detwinned BaFe$_{2}$As$_{2}$: a Raman scattering study (A. Baum - 13 June, 2018)

Subdominant $d$-wave interaction in superconducting CaKFe$_4$As$_2$? (Daniel Jost - 30 May, 2018)
In $B_{1g}$ symmetry the difference between normal and superconducting state is most pronounced, and the feature is shifted downwards with respect to those in $A_{1g}$ and $B_{2g}$ symmetry. The maximum peaking at 134 cm$^{-1}$ (16.6 meV) has a substructure on the high-energy side. We interpret the peak at 134 cm$^{-1}$ in terms of a collective Bardasis-Schrieffer (BS) mode and the substructure as a remainder of the pair-breaking feature on the electron bands. There is a very weak peak at 50 cm$^{-1}$ (6.2 meV) which is tentatively assigned to another BS mode.

Coherent Dirac plasmons in topological insulators (Richarj Mondal - 24 April, 2018)
The transient coherent phonon spectra obtained at different time frames exhibit a Fano-like asymmetric line shape of the $A^2_{1g}$ mode, which is attributed to quantum interference between continuum-like coherent Dirac-plasmons and phonons. By analyzing the time-dependent asymmetric line shape using the two-temperature model (TTM), it was determined that a Fano-like resonance persisted up to $\approx$1 ps after photo-excitation with a relaxation profile dominated by Gaussian decay at $\leq$200 fs. The asymmetry parameter could be well described by the TTM for $\geq$200 fs, therefore suggesting the coherence time of the Dirac plasmon is $\approx$200 fs.

Ubiquitous Cell-Free Massive MIMO Communications (Giovanni Interdonato - 10 April, 2018)
From 1G to 4G, the massive traffic growth has been managed by a combination of wider bandwidths, refined radio interfaces, and smaller cells [1]. Due its cost-efficiency, the latter has contributed the most; cell towers used to be 10 km apart and are now only 100 m apart in urban areas. While rigid frequency planning was originally used to alleviate inter-cell interference, the interference is becoming a major bottleneck as we densify the networks [2], because each cell is then hit by non-negligible interference from many neighboring cells. One way to deal with inter-cell interference is to manage it spatially by Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) methods [3], which is a key 5G technology

On the phonon dispersion relation of single-crystalline $Î²$--FeSe (Khalil Zakeri - 20 November, 2017)
The most prominent phonon modes $A_{1g}$, $B_{1g}$, and $A_{2u}$ appear at energies of about $20.5$ and $25.6$ and $40$ meV, respectively. It is observed that both the $B_{1g}$ and $A_{2u}$ phonon modes undergo a downward shift while increasing the temperature from 15 to 300 K. In the case of the $A_{2u}$ mode this shift is about 1.5 meV.

Coherent phonons in a $Bi_2Se_3$ film generated by an intense single-cycle THz pulse (A. A. Melnikov - 24 February, 2018)
We report an observation of coherent phonons of $E_g^1$, $E_u^1$, $A_{1g}^1$, and $E_g^2$ symmetry generated in a single-crystal film of $Bi_2Se_3$ by an intense single-cycle THz pulse. The largest signal is detected at the frequency of 4.05 THz that corresponds to the $E_g^2$ mode. The generation of $E_g^2$ phonons is interpreted as resonant excitation of the Raman mode by the second harmonic of THz-driven nonlinear $E_u^1$ oscillator, the fundamental frequency of which (2.05 THz) is approximately half that of $E_g^2$. The origin of nonlinearity in this case is cubic lattice anharmonicity, while generation of $E_g^1$ (1.1 THz) and $A_{1g}^1$ (2.25 THz) phonons is a manifestation of quartic anharmonicity enhanced by the occasional combination relations between phonon frequencies in $Bi_2Se_3$.

Given TRAPPIST-1 planets large EUV irradiation (at least 1000x Titan's flux), CH4 and NH3 should be photodissociated rapidly and thus be hard to accumulate in the atmosphere

Examining possible neutron-halo nuclei heaver than $^{37}$Mg (Ikuko Hamamoto - 7 April, 2017)
It is pointed out that due to the narrowed N=50 spherical energy-gap and a few resulting close-lying neutron one-particle levels, 1g$_{9/2}$, 3s$_{1/2}$, and 2d$_{5/2}$, for spherical shape, nuclei with some weakly-bound neutrons filling in those levels may be deformed and have a good chance to show deformed s-wave halo.

Pressure-dependent Semiconductor to Semimetal and Lifshitz transitions in 2H-MoTe$_2$: Raman and First-principles studies (Achintya Bera - 1 February, 2017)
The transition at 6 GPa is marked by changes in the pressure coefficients of A$_{1g}$ and E$^{1}_{2g}$ Raman mode frequencies as well as in their relative intensity. The transition at $\sim$ 16.5 GPa is identified with the changes in linewidths of the Raman modes as well as in the pressure coefficients of their frequencies. Our theoretical analysis clearly shows that the structure remains the same upto 30 GPa. However, the topology of the Fermi-surface evolves as a function of pressure, and abrupt appearance of electron and hole pockets at P $\sim$ 20 GPa marks a Lifshitz transition.

With the increased number of Sm vacancies up to 1% we observe an increase of spectral weight below 20~meV showing that the gap is filling in with electronic states. These excitations broaden as a decrease in the lifetime with increasing number of vacancies and are quenched by the presence of in-gap states at concentration of Sm vacancies of about 1%

Raman scattering in few-layer MoTe$_{2}$ (M. Grzeszczyk - 15 April, 2016)

We argue that the rich structure of the out-of-plane vibrational modes observed in Raman scattering spectra excited with the use of 632.8 nm laser light results from its resonance with the electronic transition at the M or K points of the MoTe$_{2}$ first Brillouin zone.

When the leading spin-singlet pairing is in the $d_{xz}, d_{yz}$ orbital subspace, this state retains the $s$-wave form factor but has a $B_{1g}$ symmetry due to an internal $Ï_3$ structure in the orbital space. Within a five-orbital $t-J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with orbital-selective exchange couplings, we show that the proposed pairing state is energetically competitive over a finite range of control parameters

Signatures of nematic quantum critical fluctuations in the Raman spectra of lightly doped cuprates (S. Caprara - 6 May, 2015)
We find that the longitudinal nematic fluctuations peaked at zero transferred momentum account well for the anomalous Raman absorption observed in these systems in the $B_{2g}$ channel, while the absence of such effect in the $B_{1g}$ channel may be due to the overall suppression of Raman response at low frequencies, associated with the pseudogap. While in Y$_{0.97}$Ca$_{0.03}$BaCuO$_{6.05}$ the low-frequency lineshape is fully accounted by longitudinal nematic collective modes alone, in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ also charge-ordering modes with finite characteristic wavevector are needed to reproduce the shoulders observed in the Raman response

Manifestation of nematic degrees of freedom in the Raman response function of iron pnictides (Una Karahasanovic - 18 June, 2015)
We establish a relation between the Raman response function in the $B_{1g}$ channel and the electronic contribution to the nematic susceptibility within the spin-driven approach to electron nematicity of the iron based superconductors. The spin-driven nematic phase, characterized by the broken $C_4$ symmetry, but unbroken $O(3$) spin-rotational symmetry, is generated by the presence of magnetic fluctuations associated with the striped phase

Higgs Mode and Magnon Interactions in 2D Quantum Antiferromagnets from Raman Scattering (S. A. Weidinger - 28 September, 2015)
Due to the momentum dependence of the Raman vertex in the relevant $B_{1g}+E_{2g}$ symmetry, the contribution from the Higgs mode is strongly suppressed. The latter give rise to a broad, asymmetric peak at $Ï\simeq 2.44\, J$, which is a result of magnon-magnon interactions mediated by the Higgs mode

Phonon and magnetic dimer excitations in Fe-based S=2 spin ladder compound BaFe$_2$Se$_2$O (Z. V. PopoviÄ - 24 December, 2013)
The antiferromagnetic long-range spin ordering in BaFe$_2$Se$_2$O below $T_N$=240 K leaves a fingerprint both in the A$_{1g}$ and B$_{1g}$ phonon mode linewidth and energy. In the energy range between 400 and 650 cm$^{-1}$ we have observed magnetic excitation related structure in the form of magnon continuum, with the peaks corresponding to the singularities in the one dimensional density of magnon states. The onset value of magnetic continuum (2$Î_{S}$) is found at about 437 cm$^{-1}$ at 15 K. The magnetic continuum disappears at about 623 K, which lead us to conclude that the short-range magnetic ordering in BaFe$_2$Se$_2$O exists apparently up to 2.6$T_N$.

While the highest frequency mode is safely assigned to the A_{1g} mode, the other two modes require a discussion in comparison to literature. Still the energy transfer from electrons to the strongly coupled phonons results in a rather weak, momentum-averaged electron-phonon coupling quantified by values for Î»<Ï^2> between 30 and 70 meV^2. This change in the chemical potential is particularly strong in a two band system like in the 122 Fe-pnictide compounds investigated here due to the pronounced variation of the electrons density of states close to the equilibrium chemical potential.

The $B_{1g}$ ($x^2-y^2$) spectra in Bi-2212 show an anomalous increase of the intensity towards overdoping, indicating that the corresponding energy scale is neither related to the pairing energy nor to the pseudogap, but possibly stems from a symmetry breaking transition at the onset point of superconductivity at $p_{\rm sc2} \simeq 0.27$.

Theory of Raman response in a superconductor with extended s-wave symmetry: Application to Fe-pnictides (Andrey V. Chubukov - 24 February, 2009)
We show that $A_{1g}$ Raman intensity has a true resonance peak below $2Î$ for extended s-wave superconducting gap, $Î(\mathbf{k}) = Î(\cos k_x + \cos k_y)/2$ in the folded Brillouin zone. No such peak emerges for a pure s-wave gap, a d-wave gap, and another extended s-wave gap with $Î(\mathbf{k}) = Î\cos{\frac{k_x}{2}} \cos{\frac{k_y}{2}}$ proposed by several groups.

Raman phonons of $Î±$-FeTe and Fe$_{1.03}$Se$_{0.3}$Te$_{0.7}$ single crystals (Tian-Long Xia - 11 April, 2009)

The scalar-order model reproduces magnetic and elastic properties in PrFe$_4$P$_{12}$ consistently such as (i) the anomaly of the magnetic susceptibility and elastic constant at the transition temperature, (ii) anisotropy of the magnetic susceptibility in the presence of uniaxial pressure, and (iii) the anomaly in the elastic constant in magnetic field

Inter-Network magnetic fields observed with sub-arcsec resolution (I. Dominguez Cerdena - 17 June, 2003)

The difference depends on the spectral line used to generate the magnetograms (Fe I 6302 or Fe I 6301). Such systematic difference can be understood if the magnetic structures producing the polarization have intrinsic field strengths exceeding 1 kG, and consequently, occupying only a very small fraction of the surface (some 2%). We observe both, magnetic signals changing in time scales smaller than 1 min, and a persistent pattern lasting longer than the duration of the sequence (17 min). The pattern resembles a network with a spatial scale between 5 and 10 arcsec, which we identify as the mesogranulation

Specific d-wave angular dependence of the in-plane magnetoresistence in antiferromagnetic tetragonal YBa_{2}Cu_{3}O_{6+x} (x~0.3) on orientation of the external magnetic field in (a,b) plane is assigned to the effective hole transport through low lying excited purely oxygen doublet O2pe_u state, not the ground b_{1g}(d_{x^2-y^2}) state. External magnetic field determines the orientation of the strong exchange field for the spin-triplet b_{1g}e_u:{}^{3}E_u state of the hole CuO_4 center and due to the spin-orbital coupling results in either orbital polarization of the E_u doublet giving rise to the spatial anisotropy of the hole transport

Large non-adiabatic hole polarons and matrix element effects in the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of dielectric cuprates (A. S. Moskvin - 23 February, 2001)
One assumes the photohole has been localised on either small (pseudo)Jahn-Teller polaron or large non-adiabatic polaron enclosed one or four to five $CuO_4$ centers, respectively, with active one-center valent $(^{1}A_{1g}-{}^{1,3}E_{u})$ manifold. In the framework of the cluster model we have performed a model microscopic calculation of the ${\bf k}$-dependence of the matrix element effects and photon polarization effects for the angle-resolved photoemission in dielectric cuprate like $Sr_{2}CuO_{2}Cl_{2}$. We show that effects like the ''remnant Fermi surface'' detected in ARPES experiment for $Ca_{2}CuO_{2}Cl_{2}$ may be, in fact, a reflection of the matrix element effects, not a reflection of the original band-structure Fermi surface, or the strong antiferromagnetic correlations

Unconventional electronic Raman spectra of borocarbide superconductors (In-Sang Yang - 31 December, 1999)

Raman cross-section calculation which includes inelastic scattering shows a relatively good fit to the features above the 2$Î$ peak, while it does not fully account for the features below the peak.

Electronic Raman scattering in HgBa_{2}Ca_{2}Cu_{3}O_{8+Î´} single crystals. Analysis of the superconducting state (A. Sacuto - 6 April, 1998)
As a consequence, the spectra in the pure $B_{1g} $ and $B_{2g} $ symmetries are directly and reliably analyzed and the pure $A_{1g} $ contribution can be easily identified. Below the critical temperature $T_{c}, $ two electronic structures at $2Î\sim 6.4 k_{B}T_{c} $ and $2Î\sim 9.4 $ $k_{B}T_{c} $ are clearly seen. $ The low energy frequency dependence of the $B_{1g} $ electronic response is strongly linear, for various excitation lines in the 476.5 to 647.1 nm range. Such experimental data cannot be reconciled with a pure $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}} $ symmetry. Instead, they strongly advocate in favor of an anisotropic superconducting gap with two distinct gap maxima and of nodes existing outside the [110] and [1,$\bar{1}$,0] directions in {\bf k}-space

The magnitude of the electric field is deduced from new Raman results on YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{6+x}$ and Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$(Ca$_{1-x}$Y$_{x}$)Cu$_{2}$O$_{8}$ with different O and Y doping, respectively

The Fano lineshape is calculated in the normal state and the change of the linewidth with temperature below T$_{c}$ is investigated for a $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ pairing symmetry. Excellent agreement is obtained for the $B_{1g}$ phonon lineshape in YBa$_{2}$Cu$_{3}$O$_{7}$.

However, the pseudogap is strongly anisotropic in momentum space, where the magnitude of the pseudogap around the nodes is smaller than that around the antinodes, which leads to that the low-energy spectral weight of the B_{1g} spectrum is suppressed heavily by the pseudogap, while the pseudogap has a more modest effect on the electronic Raman response in the B_{2g} orientation.

We find that the $a_{1g}$ orbital, although almost empty in the insulating phase, is actually responsible for the unusual magnetic order as it leads to magnetic frustration whose effect is similar to a next-nearest-neighbor exchange in a Heisenberg model on a honeycomb lattice.

Influence of collective effects and the d-CDW on electronic Raman scattering in high-T$_c$ superconductors (R. Zeyher - 4 October, 2002)
It is shown that the A$_{1g}$ and B$_{1g}$ spectra are dominated by amplitude fluctuations of the superconducting and the d-wave CDW order parameters, respectively. The B$_{2g}$ spectrum contains no collective effects and its broad peak reflects vaguely the doping dependence of T$_c$, similarly to the pronounced peak in the A$_{1g}$ spectrum

Orbital state and magnetic properties of LiV_2 O_4 (I. A. Nekrasov - 28 August, 2002)
The trigonal crystal field splits the V 3d orbitals such that the a_{1g} and e_{g}^{pi} orbitals cross the Fermi level, with the former being slightly lower in energy and narrower in bandwidth. In this situation, the d-d Coulomb interaction leads to an almost localization of one electron per V ion in the a_{1g} orbital, while the e_{g}^{pi} orbitals form relatively broad bands with 1/8 filling

Collective Spin Fluctuation Mode and Raman Scattering in Superconducting Cuprates (F. Venturini - 10 April, 2000)
