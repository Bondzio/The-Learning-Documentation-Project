ShIFT: A Semi-haptic Interface for Flute Tutoring (Gus Xia - 18 March, 2018)
For the first time, the pitch range of the haptically learned pieces goes beyond an octave (with the fingering motion covers most of the possible choices) and the duration of learned pieces cover a whole phrase. Experiments show that our semi-haptic interface is effective as long as learners are not "tone deaf." Using our prototype device, the learning rate is about 30% faster compared to learning from videos.

Moreover, a new algorithm to estimate the subband RT is devised, where the RT estimates for the lower octave subbands are extrapolated from the RT estimates of the upper subbands by means of a simple model for the frequency-dependency of the subband RT

Also shown, are methods of code generation, binding automation, and the niche we plan to fill in the absence of GUI in Octave
