The 30-Year Cycle In The AI Debate (Jean-Marie Chauvet - 8 October, 2018)
Many existing tech companies -- including the giants like Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Microsoft -- have opened new research labs. This paper reviews briefly the track-record in AI and Machine Learning and finds this pattern of early dramatic successes, followed by philosophical critique and unexpected difficulties, if not downright stagnation, returning almost to the clock in 30-year cycles since 1958.

Evaluating the Effectiveness of Health Awareness Events by Google Search Frequency (Zheng Hao - 8 October, 2018)
Here 46 events are selected and their data from 2004 to 2017 are downloaded from Google Trend(GT). Three statistical methods including Transfer Function Noise modeling, Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, and Binomial inference are conducted on 46 GT data sets. Our study show that 10 health awareness events are effective with evidence of a significant increase in search frequencies in the event months, and 28 events are ineffective, with the rest being classified as unclear.

Characterizing Deep-Learning I/O Workloads in TensorFlow (Steven W. D. Chien - 6 October, 2018)
In this work, we characterize the I/O performance and scaling of TensorFlow, an open-source programming framework developed by Google and specifically designed for solving DL problems. We find that increasing the number of threads increases TensorFlow bandwidth by a maximum of 2.3x and 7.8x on our benchmark environments. The use of a burst buffer to checkpoint to a fast small capacity storage and copy asynchronously the checkpoints to a slower large capacity storage resulted in a performance improvement of 2.6x with respect to checkpointing directly to slower storage on our benchmark environment.

Google Scholar, Web of Science, and Scopus: a systematic comparison of citations in 252 subject categories (Alberto MartÃ­n-MartÃ­n - 5 October, 2018)
Despite citation counts from Google Scholar (GS), Web of Science (WoS), and Scopus being widely consulted by researchers and sometimes used in research evaluations, there is no recent or systematic evidence about the differences between them. In response, this paper investigates 2,448,055 citations to 2,299 English-language highly-cited documents from 252 GS subject categories published in 2006, comparing GS, the WoS Core Collection, and Scopus. GS consistently found the largest percentage of citations across all areas (93%-96%), far ahead of Scopus (35%-77%) and WoS (27%-73%). GS found nearly all the WoS (95%) and Scopus (92%) citations. Most citations found only by GS were from non-journal sources (48%-65%), including theses, books, conference papers, and unpublished materials. Many were non-English (19%-38%), and they tended to be much less cited than citing sources that were also in Scopus or WoS

FATE: Fast and Accurate Timing Error Prediction Framework for Low Power DNN Accelerator Design (Jeff Zhang - 2 July, 2018)

We show that FATE results in between 8 times-58 times speed-up in timing simulations, while introducing less than 2% error in classification accuracy estimates. We demonstrate the use of FATE by comparing to conventional DNN accelerator that uses 2's complement (2C) arithmetic with an alternative implementation that uses signed magnitude representations (SMR). We show that that the SMR implementation provides 18% more energy savings for the same classification accuracy than 2C, a result that might be of independent interest.

GABAM 2015 consists of spatial extent of fires that occurred during 2015 and not of fires that occurred in previous years. Cross-comparison with recent Fire_cci version 5.0 BA product found a similar spatial distribution and a strong correlation ($R^2=0.74$) between the burned areas from the two products, although differences were found in specific land cover categories (particularly in agriculture land). Preliminary global validation showed the commission and omission error of GABAM 2015 are 13.17% and 30.13%, respectively.

Analyzing and Mitigating the Impact of Permanent Faults on a Systolic Array Based Neural Network Accelerator (Jeff Zhang - 17 February, 2018)
A popular architecture for DNN acceleration, adopted by the Google Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), utilizes a systolic array based matrix multiplication unit at its core. To this end, we empirically show that the classification accuracy of a baseline TPU drops significantly even at extremely low fault rates (as low as $0.006\%$). We then propose two novel strategies, fault-aware pruning (FAP) and fault-aware pruning+retraining (FAP+T), that enable the TPU to operate at fault rates of up to $50\%$, with negligible drop in classification accuracy (as low as $0.1\%$) and no run-time performance overhead. The FAP+T does introduce a one-time retraining penalty per TPU chip before it is deployed, but we propose optimizations that reduce this one-time penalty to under 12 minutes

Efficient Implementation of the Room Simulator for Training Deep Neural Network Acoustic Models (Chanwoo Kim - 9 December, 2017)
Even though Google Room Simulator in [1] was shown to be quite effective in reducing the Word Error Rates (WERs) for far-field applications by generating simulated far-field training sets, it requires a very large number of Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) of large size. Room Simulator in [1] used approximately 80 percent of Central Processing Unit (CPU) usage in our CPU + Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) training architecture [2]. Experimentally, we conclude that we can cut the tail portions of RIRs whose power is less than 20 dB below the maximum power without sacrificing the speech recognition accuracy. Using these approaches, we were able to reduce CPU usage for the room simulator portion down to 9.69 percent in CPU/GPU training architecture. Profiling result shows that we obtain 22.4 times speed-up on a single machine and 37.3 times speed up on Google's distributed training infrastructure.

Does it matter which search engine is used? A user study using post-task relevance judgments (Sebastian Suenkler - 23 October, 2017)
The objective of this research was to find out how the two search engines Google and Bing perform when users work freely on pre-defined tasks, and judge the relevance of the results immediately after finishing their search session. In a user study, 64 participants conducted two search tasks each, and then judged the results on the following: (1) The quality of the results they selected in their search sessions, (2) The quality of the results they were presented with in their search sessions (but which they did not click on), (3) The quality of the results from the competing search engine for their queries (which they did not see in their search session)

The Geometry of Large Tundra Lakes Observed in Historical Maps and Satellite Images (Ivan Sudakov - 23 October, 2017)
We have studied images of tundra lakes in historical maps from the State Hydrological Institute, Russia (date 1977; scale $0.21166$ km/pixel) and in Landsat satellite images derived from the Google Earth Engine (G.E.E.; date 2016; scale $0.1503$ km/pixel). For lakes observed in historical maps, this bifurcation occurs among lakes larger than $100$ km$^2$ (fractal dimension $1.43$ to $1.87$). For lakes observed in satellite images this bifurcation occurs among lakes larger than $\sim$100 km$^2$ (fractal dimension $1.31$ to $1.95$). Tundra lakes with a fractal dimension close to $2$ have a tendency to be self-similar with respect to their area--perimeter relationships. Area--perimeter measurements indicate that lakes with a length scale greater than $70$ km$^2$ are power-law distributed

Faculty citation measures are highly correlated with peer assessment of computer science doctoral programs (Slobodan Vucetic - 17 August, 2017)
In Fall 2016 we collected Google Scholar citation data for 4,352 tenure-track CS faculty from 173 U.S. To measure the research strength of a CS doctoral program we use 2 groups of citation measures. News in 2014 is as high as 0.890. Pearson correlation of those measures with the peer assessment is as high as 0.909. By combining those two groups of measures using linear regression, we create the Scholar score whose Pearson correlation with the peer assessment is 0.933 and which explains 87.2% of the variance in the peer assessment. Our evaluation shows that the highest 62 ranked CS doctoral programs by the U.S. News peer assessment are much higher correlated with the Scholar score than the next 57 ranked programs, indicating the deficiencies of peer assessment of less-known CS programs

First, we show that Google Correlate can be used to illustrate socio-economic differences on the circumstances around pregnancy and birth: e.g., searches for "flying while pregnant" are linked to high income fertility, and "paternity test" are linked to non-marital fertility. Second, we combine several search queries to build predictive models of regional variation in fertility, explaining about 75% of the variance

Temporal evolution of notoriety of Wikipedia pages with origin in social networks (JJ Merelo-GuervÃ³s - 9 March, 2017)
The Wikipedia is a web portal created by users and its simplicity, references and also the inclusion as insets introductory paragraphs for their pages in Google search results have made it the go-to place to find out about current events or people featured in them. We conclude that a 7 day duration is the statistical mode and that this duration is relatively independent of the initial increase in the number of visits.

"If You Can't Beat them, Join them": A Usability Approach to Interdependent Privacy in Cloud Apps (Hamza Harkous - 24 March, 2017)
Based on analyzing a real dataset of 183 Google Drive users and 131 third party apps, we discover that collaborators inflict a privacy loss which is at least 39% higher than what users themselves cause. Via a web experiment with 141 participants recruited from CrowdFlower, we show that our privacy indicator can significantly increase the user's likelihood of choosing the app that minimizes her privacy loss. We demonstrate that adopting such a decision-making process is capable of reducing the growth of users' privacy loss by 70% in a Google Drive-based network and by 40% in an author collaboration network

Reported rates indicate a minimum weighted overall accuracy of 84%. By integrating confidence levels during the ground truth annotation, stratified sampling on the several Corine Level 3 subclasses and the weighted overall accuracy assessment, the different aspects of the considered land cover products can be highlighted more objectively.

Using Deep Learning and Google Street View to Estimate the Demographic Makeup of the US (Timnit Gebru - 2 March, 2017)
Here, we present a method that determines socioeconomic trends from 50 million images of street scenes, gathered in 200 American cities by Google Street View cars. Data from this census of motor vehicles, which enumerated 22M automobiles in total (8% of all automobiles in the US), was used to accurately estimate income, race, education, and voting patterns, with single-precinct resolution. (The average US precinct contains approximately 1000 people.) The resulting associations are surprisingly simple and powerful. For instance, if the number of sedans encountered during a 15-minute drive through a city is higher than the number of pickup trucks, the city is likely to vote for a Democrat during the next Presidential election (88% chance); otherwise, it is likely to vote Republican (82%)

Besides shedding light on the current DSDK practice, our study quantitatively measures the two side effects of inappropriate DSDK versions: (i) around 1.8K apps have API calls that do not exist in some declared SDK versions, which causes runtime crash bugs on those platform versions; (ii) over 400 apps, due to claiming the outdated targeted DSDK versions, are potentially exploitable by remote code execution

Velvet Worms (Onychophora) in Folklore and Art: Geographic Pattern, Types of Cultural Reference and Public Perception (Julian Monge-Najera - 21 May, 2016)
Methods: We asked open-ended questions to farmers who know the worms, consulted experts and searched the Internet to document folkloric and artistic instances using all the names that these animals receive in English, Spanish and Portuguese (languages of the countries where they occur) as well as other languages, and automatic image search, in Web of Science, CrossRef, Google Scholar and Google. Results: We found more than 80 cases of direct references to velvet worms in folklore and art, mostly from the USA, Australia, Brazil, Costa Rica and New Zealand. Per capita the countries with more cases are New Zealand (24 cases per million inhabitants), Costa Rica (16 cases per million inhabitants) and Australia (3 cases per million inhabitants)

The ratio of GS over Scopus citation varies across subject fields between 1.0 and 4.0, while Open Access journals in the sample show higher ratios than their non-OA counterparts. The effect of double citation counts in GS due to multiple citations with identical or substantially similar meta-data occurs in less than 2 per cent of cases

Advanced Page Rank Algorithm with Semantics, In Links, Out Links and Google Analytics (Aritra Banerjee - 7 September, 2017)
In this paper we have modified the existing page ranking mechanism as an advanced Page Rank Algorithm based on Semantics Inlinks Outlinks and Google Analytics. We have used Semantics page ranking to rank pages according to the word searched and match it with the metadata of the website and provide a value of rank according to the highest priority.We have also used Google analytics to store the number of hits of a website in a particular variable and add the required percentage amount to the ranking procedure.The proposed algorithm is used to find more relevant information according to users query.So this concept is very useful to display most valuable pages on the top of the result list on the basis of user browsing behaviour which reduce the search space to a large scale.
