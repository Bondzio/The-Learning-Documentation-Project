The 30-Year Cycle In The AI Debate (Jean-Marie Chauvet - 8 October, 2018)
The rapid changes in these everyday work and entertainment tools have fueled a rising interest in the underlying technology itself; journalists write about AI tirelessly, and companies -- of tech nature or not -- brand themselves with AI, Machine Learning or Deep Learning whenever they get a chance. This paper reviews briefly the track-record in AI and Machine Learning and finds this pattern of early dramatic successes, followed by philosophical critique and unexpected difficulties, if not downright stagnation, returning almost to the clock in 30-year cycles since 1958.

Neural Named Entity Recognition from Subword Units (Abdalghani Abujabal - 27 August, 2018)
Named entity recognition (NER) is a vital task in language technology. Existing neural models for NER rely mostly on dedicated word-level representations, which suffer from two main shortcomings: 1) the vocabulary size is large, yielding large memory requirements and training time, and 2) they cannot learn morphological representations. Our experiments show that 1) with increasing training data, performance of models trained solely on subword units becomes closer to that of models with dedicated word-level embeddings (91.35 vs 93.92 F1 for English), while using a much smaller vocabulary size (332 vs 74K), 2) subword units enhance models with dedicated word-level embeddings, and 3) combining different subword units improves performance.

An emerging technology in the field is contrast-enhanced digital mammography (CEDM), which includes a low energy (LE) image similar to DM, and a recombined image leveraging tumor neoangiogenesis similar to breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). To evaluate the validity of our approach, we first develop a deep-CNN using 49 CEDM cases collected from Mayo Clinic to prove the contributions from recombined images for improved breast cancer diagnosis (0.86 in accuracy using LE imaging vs. 0.90 in accuracy using both LE and recombined imaging). We then develop a shallow-CNN using the same 49 CEDM cases to learn the nonlinear mapping from LE to recombined images. Next, we use 69 DM cases collected from the hospital located at Zhejiang University, China to generate "virtual" recombined images. Using DM alone provides 0.91 in accuracy, whereas SD-CNN improves the diagnostic accuracy to 0.95.

Ultra wideband technology has shown great promise for providing high-quality location estimation, even in complex indoor multipath environments, but existing ultra wideband systems require tens to hundreds of milliwatts during operation. To evaluate this concept, we implement an energy-harvesting Slocalization tag and find that Slocalization can recover ultra wideband backscatter in under fifteen minutes across thirty meters of space and localize tags with a mean 3D Euclidean error of only 30 cm.

However, current memory-based PUFs utilize only a single memory technology for constructing the PUF, which has several disadvantages including making them vulnerable to security attacks. Extensive authentication tests across a wide temperature range (20 - 60 deg. Celsius) and accelerated aging (12 months) demonstrate the robustness of the proposed design, which achieves a 100% true-positive rate and 0% false-positive rate for authentication across these parameter ranges.

Bit Fusion: Bit-Level Dynamically Composable Architecture for Accelerating Deep Neural Networks (Hardik Sharma - 30 May, 2018)
The proposed microarchitecture is implemented in Verilog and synthesized in 45 nm technology. In the same area, frequency, and process technology, BitFusion offers 3.9x speedup and 5.1x energy savings over Eyeriss. Compared to Stripes, BitFusion provides 2.6x speedup and 3.9x energy reduction at 45 nm node when BitFusion area and frequency are set to those of Stripes. Scaling to GPU technology node of 16 nm, BitFusion almost matches the performance of a 250-Watt Titan Xp, which uses 8-bit vector instructions, while BitFusion merely consumes 895 milliwatts of power.

On the Capacity of Face Representation (Sixue Gong - 15 February, 2018)
Face recognition is a widely used technology with numerous large-scale applications, such as surveillance, social media and law enforcement. Our experiments on unconstrained faces indicate that, (a) our proposed model yields a capacity upper bound of 5.8x$10^{8}$ for FaceNet and 1x$10^{0}$ for Eigenfaces at a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 1%, (b) the face representation capacity reduces drastically as you lower the desired FAR (for FaceNet; the capacity at FAR of 0.1% and 0.001% is 2.4x$10^{6}$ and 7.0x$10^{2}$, respectively), and (c) the empirical performance of FaceNet is significantly below the theoretical limit.

Cost Modeling and Projection for Stacked Nanowire Fabric (Naveen Kumar Macha - 9 November, 2017)
To continue scaling beyond 2-D CMOS with 3-D integration, any new 3-D IC technology has to be comparable or better than 2-D CMOS in terms of scalability, enhanced functionality, density, power, performance, cost, and reliability. Recently, we proposed a stacked horizontal nanowire based transistor-level 3-D integration approach, called SN3D [1][2] that solves scaling challenges and achieves tremendous benefits with respect to 2-D CMOS while keeping manageable thermal profile. Since SN3D is a new 3-D IC fabric, based on our proposed manufacturing pathway[1] we assumed complexity of fabrication steps as proportionality constants in our cost estimation model. Our analysis revealed 86%, 72% and 74% reduction in area; 55%, 43% and 43% reduction in interconnects distribution and total interconnect length for SN3D, which largely contributed to 70%, 67% and 68% reduction in cost in comparison to 2D, T3D and M3D respectively.

Methods: In this paper, two kinds of ERP-based speller systems were tested on 18 ALS patients to: (1) assess performance when they spelled 42 characters online continuously, without a break; and (2) to compare performance between a matrix-based speller paradigm (MS-P, mean visual angle 6 degree) and a new speller paradigm that used a larger visual angle called the large visual angle speller paradigm (LS-P, mean visual angle 8 degree). Results: Although results showed that there were no significant differences between the two paradigms in accuracy trend over continuous use (p>0.05), the fatigue during the LS-P condition was significantly lower than that of MS-P (p<0.05). Conclusion: 15 subjects obtained higher than 80% feedback accuracy (online output accuracy) and 9 subjects obtained higher than 90% feedback accuracy in one of the two paradigms, thus validating the BCI approaches in this study

Using ECC DRAM to Adaptively Increase Memory Capacity (Yixin Luo - 28 June, 2017)
Modern DRAM modules are often equipped with hardware error correction capabilities, especially for DRAM deployed in large-scale data centers, as process technology scaling has increased the susceptibility of these devices to errors. This additional chip expands the raw capacity of a DRAM module by 12.5%, but the applications are unable to use any of this extra capacity, as it is used exclusively to provide reliability for all data

Risk-Informed Interference Assessment for Shared Spectrum Bands: A Wi-Fi/LTE Coexistence Case Study (Andra M. Voicu - 8 June, 2017)
Our contributions are: we apply, for the first time, risk assessment to a problem of inter-technology spectrum sharing, i.e. Wi-Fi/LTE in the 5 GHz unlicensed band, and we demonstrate that this method comprehensively quantifies the interference impact. Our results show that no regulatory intervention is needed to ensure harmonious technical Wi-Fi/LTE coexistence: for the typically large number of channels available in the 5 GHz band, the risk for Wi-Fi from LTE is negligible, rendering policy and engineering concerns largely moot. For LTE intra-technology inter-operator coexistence, both variants typically coexist well in the 5 GHz band, but for dense deployments, implementing listen-before-talk causes less interference.

LoRa Backscatter: Enabling The Vision of Ubiquitous Connectivity (Vamsi Talla - 16 May, 2017)
The vision of embedding connectivity into billions of everyday objects runs into the reality of existing communication technologies --- there is no existing wireless technology that can provide reliable and long-range communication at tens of microwatts of power as well as cost less than a dime. Our design can successfully backscatter from any location between an RF source and receiver, separated by 475 m, while being compatible with commodity LoRa hardware. Further, when our backscatter device is co-located with the RF source, the receiver can be as far as 2.8 km away. We deploy our system in a 4,800 $ft^{2}$ (446 $m^{2}$) house spread across three floors, a 13,024 $ft^{2}$ (1210 $m^{2}$) office area covering 41 rooms, as well as a one-acre (4046 $m^{2}$) vegetable farm and show that we can achieve reliable coverage, using only a single RF source and receiver. We show that these devices can reliably backscatter data across a 3,328 $ft^{2}$ (309 $m^{2}$) room. Finally, we present a design sketch of a LoRa backscatter IC that shows that it costs less than a dime at scale and consumes only 9.25 $Î¼$W of power, which is more than 1000x lower power than LoRa radio chipsets.

Exploiting Data Longevity for Enhancing the Lifetime of Flash-based Storage Class Memory (Wonil Choi - 17 April, 2017)

In an effort to improve flash lifetime, first, by quantifying data longevity in an SCM, we show that a majority of the data stored in a solid-state SCM do not require long retention times provided by flash memory (i.e., up to 10 years in modern devices); second, by exploiting retention time relaxation, we propose a novel mechanism, called Dense-SLC (D-SLC), which enables us perform multiple writes into a cell during each erase cycle for lifetime extension; and finally, we discuss the required changes in the flash management software (FTL) in order to use this characteristic for extending the lifetime of the solid-state part of an SCM

On the Deployment of Distributed Antennas for Wireless Power Transfer with Safety Electromagnetic Radiation Level Requirement (Chao Zhang - 7 March, 2017)
The extremely low efficiency is regarded as the bottleneck of Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) technology. In this model, three key questions are intended to be answered: 1) With the SERL, what is the performance of the harvested power at the users ? 2) How do we configure the parameters to maximize the efficiency of WPT? 3) Under the same constraints, does the DA-PB still have performance gain than the Co-located Antenna PB (CA-PB)? First, the minimum antenna height of DA-PB is derived to make the radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic radiation power density at any location of the charging cell lower than the SERL published by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). Second, the closed-form expressions of average harvested Direct Current (DC) power per user in the charging cell for pass-loss exponent 2 and 4 are also provided. In order to maximize the average efficiency of WPT, the optimal radii for distributed antennas elements (DAEs) are derived when the pass-loss exponent takes the typical value $2$ and $4$

Point-Cloud-Based Aerial Fragmentation Analysis for Application in the Minerals Industry (Thomas Bamford - 26 July, 2017)
Our previous work has used UAV technology for the first time to acquire real-time rock fragmentation data and has shown comparable quality of results; however, it still required the (potentially dangerous) placement of scale objects, and continued to make the assumption that the rock pile surface is planar and that the scale objects lie on the surface plane. Comparison of the rock size distributions show that this point-cloud-based method enables producing measurements with better or comparable accuracy (within 10% of the ground truth) to the manual method with scale objects.

Exoskeletons are a promising technology that enables individuals with mobility limitations to walk again. As the 2016 Cybathlon illustrated, however, the community has a considerable way to go before exoskeletons have the necessary capabilities to be incorporated into daily life. As our entry to the 2016 Cybathlon Powered Exoskeleton Competition, Mina v2's performance allowed us to explore the effectiveness of its powered ankle compared to other powered exoskeletons for pilots with paraplegia. We designed our gaits to incorporate powered ankle plantar flexion to help improve mobility, which allowed our pilot to navigate the given Cybathlon tasks quickly, including those that required ascending movements, and reliably achieve average, conservative walking speeds of 1.04 km/h (0.29 m/s). This enabled our team to place second overall in the Powered Exoskeleton Competition in the 2016 Cybathlon.

Internet security and technology policy research regularly uses technical indicators of abuse in order to identify culprits and to tailor mitigation strategies. We find that 84\,\% of the variation in abuse counts across 45,358 hosting providers can be explained with structural factors alone. Informed by the fitted model, we systematically select and enrich a subset of 105 homogeneous "statistical twins" with additional explanatory variables, unreasonable to collect for \emph{all} hosting providers. These factors together explain a further 77\,\% of the remaining variation, calling into question premature inferences from raw abuse indicators on security efforts of actors, and suggesting the adoption of similar analysis frameworks in all domains where network measurement aims at informing technology policy.

High-Bandwidth and Large Coupling Tolerance Graded-Index Multimode Polymer Waveguides for On-board High-Speed Optical Interconnects (Jian Chen - 25 November, 2016)
Multimode polymer waveguides in particular constitute an attractive technology for on-board optical interconnects as they provide high bandwidth, offer relaxed alignment tolerances, and can be cost-effectively integrated onto standard printed circuit boards (PCBs). Bandwidth-length products of >70 GHzxm and ~65 GHzxm are observed using a 50/125 um multimode fibre (MMF) launch for input offsets of +/- 10 um without and with the use of a mode mixer respectively; and enhanced values of >100 GHzxm are found under a 10x microscope objective launch for input offsets of ~18 x 20 um^2. The large range of offsets is within the -1 dB alignment tolerances. The reported results clearly demonstrate the potential of this technology for use in high-speed board-level optical links, and indicate that data transmission of 100 Gb/s over a multimode polymer waveguide is feasible with appropriate refractive index engineering.

Highly-Secure Physically Unclonable Cryptographic Primitives Using Nonlinear Conductance and Analog State Tuning in Memristive Crossbar Arrays (Hussein Nili - 23 November, 2016)
The rapidly expanding hardware-intrinsic security primitives are aimed at addressing significant security challenges of a massively interconnected world in the age of information technology. The experimental results show that the average uniformity and diffusivity, measured on a random sample of 6,000 64-bit responses, out of ~697,000 total, is close to ideal 50% with 5% standard deviation for both metrics. The uniqueness, which was evaluated on a smaller sample by readjusting conductances of crosspoint devices within the same crossbar, is also close to the ideal 50% +/- 1%, while the smallest bit error rate, i.e. reciprocal of reliability, measured over 30-day window under +/-20% power supply variations, was ~ 1.5% +/- 1%

VerdictDB: Universalizing Approximate Query Processing (Yongjoo Park - 15 June, 2018)
Additionally, the few AQP engines that are available are each tied to a specific platform and require users to completely abandon their existing databases---an unrealistic expectation given the infancy of the AQP technology. Therefore, we argue that a universal solution is needed: a database-agnostic approximation engine that will widen the reach of this emerging technology across various platforms.
