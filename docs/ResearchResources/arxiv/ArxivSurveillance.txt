GPU based Parallel Optimization for Real Time Panoramic Video Stitching (Chengyao Du - 4 October, 2018)
With the development of video surveillance and the requirement for 3D converged video surveillance in smart cities, CPU and GPU are required to possess strong processing abilities to make panoramic video. In order to solve these problems,we propose a real-time panoramic video stitching framework.The framework we propose mainly consists of three algorithms, LORB image feature extraction algorithm, feature point matching algorithm based on LSH and GPU parallel video stitching algorithm based on CUDA.The experiment results show that the algorithm mentioned can improve the performance in the stages of feature extraction of images stitching and matching, the running speed of which is 11 times than that of the traditional ORB algorithm and 639 times than that of the traditional SIFT algorithm. The performance of the system accomplished in the paper is 29.2 times than that of the former embedded one, while the power dissipation is reduced to 10W.

Rate-Accuracy Trade-Off In Video Classification With Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (Mohammad Jubran - 27 September, 2018)
However, when considering visual Internet-of-Things applications, surveillance systems and semantic crawlers of large video repositories, the video capture and the CNN-based semantic analysis parts do not tend to be co-located. Based on three CNN architectures and two action recognition datasets, we achieve 11%-94% saving in bitrate with marginal effect on classification accuracy. A model-based selection between multiple CNNs increases these savings further, to the point where, if up to 7% loss of accuracy can be tolerated, video classification can take place with as little as 3 kbps for the transport of the required compressed video information to the system implementing the CNN models.

On the Capacity of Face Representation (Sixue Gong - 15 February, 2018)
Face recognition is a widely used technology with numerous large-scale applications, such as surveillance, social media and law enforcement. Our experiments on unconstrained faces indicate that, (a) our proposed model yields a capacity upper bound of 5.8x$10^{8}$ for FaceNet and 1x$10^{0}$ for Eigenfaces at a false acceptance rate (FAR) of 1%, (b) the face representation capacity reduces drastically as you lower the desired FAR (for FaceNet; the capacity at FAR of 0.1% and 0.001% is 2.4x$10^{6}$ and 7.0x$10^{2}$, respectively), and (c) the empirical performance of FaceNet is significantly below the theoretical limit.

In this truncated octahedron placement strategy, the transmission range must be at least 1.7889 times the sensing range in order to maintain connectivity among nodes. If the transmission range is between 1.4142 and 1.7889 times the sensing range, then a hexagonal prism placement strategy or a rhombic dodecahedron placement strategy should be used. Although the required number of nodes in the hexagonal prism and the rhombic dodecahedron placement strategies is the same, this number is 43.25% higher than the number of nodes required by the truncated octahedron placement strategy

A Novel Semi-Supervised Algorithm for Rare Prescription Side Effect Discovery (Jenna Reps - 2 September, 2014)
Side effects that occur in more than one in a thousand patients are likely to be signalled efficiently by current drug surveillance methods, however, these same methods may take decades before generating signals for rarer side effects, risking medical morbidity or mortality in patients prescribed the drug while the rare side effect is undiscovered. Furthermore, for the majority of the drug investigated it generated signals for rare side effects at a more stringent signalling threshold than existing methods and shows the potential to become a fundamental part of post marketing surveillance to detect rare side effects.
