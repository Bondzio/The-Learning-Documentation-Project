FRnet-DTI: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks with Evolutionary and Structural Features for Drug-Target Interaction (Farshid Rayhan - 31 August, 2018)
The task of drug-target interaction prediction holds significant importance in pharmacology and therapeutic drug design. Using the first method FRnet-1, we generate 4096 features for each of the instances in each of the datasets and use the second method, FRnet-2, to identify interaction probability employing those features

On the Formulation of Performant SPARQL Queries (Antonis Loizou - 2 April, 2013)
Moreover, we empirically verify the efficacy of the heuristics using a set of openly available datasets and corresponding SPARQL queries developed by a large pharmacology data integration project. The experimental results show improvements in performance across 6 state-of-the-art RDF stores.

Predicting Rich Drug-Drug Interactions via Biomedical Knowledge Graphs and Text Jointly Embedding (Meng Wang - 12 March, 2018)
Minimizing adverse reactions caused by drug-drug interactions has always been a momentous research topic in clinical pharmacology. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms several state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of capability and accuracy.

Liposomes versus metallic nanostructures: differences in the process of knowledge translation in cancer (David Fajardo-Ortiz - 12 April, 2016)
In the case of liposomes, our results identify subnetworks (invisible colleges) associated with different therapeutic strategies: nanopharmacology, hyperthermia, and gene therapy

Mapping Academic Institutions According to Their Journal Publication Profile: Spanish Universities as a Case Study (J. A. GarcÃ­a - 17 February, 2013)
We first map the study sample according to an institution's overall research output, then we use it for two scientific fields (Information and Communication Technologies, as well as Medicine and Pharmacology) as a means to demonstrate how our methodology can be applied, not only for analyzing institutions as a whole, but also in different disciplinary contexts.
