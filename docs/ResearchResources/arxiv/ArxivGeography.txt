Taxi demand forecasting: A HEDGE based tessellation strategy for improved accuracy (Neema Davis - 29 May, 2018)
Our study finds that the performance of each tessellation strategy is highly dependent on the city geography, spatial distribution of the data, and the time of the day, and that neither strategy is found to perform optimally across the forecast horizon. We achieve an average accuracy of above 80% per km^2 for both data sets considered at 60 minute aggregation levels.

Exploring the Urban - Rural Incarceration Divide: Drivers of Local Jail Incarceration Rates in the U.S (Rachael Weiss Riley - 6 October, 2017)
Preliminary time trend analysis conducted by the Vera Institute of Justice (Vera) uncovered disparities in county jail incarceration rates by geography. Using county jail data from 2000 - 2013 and county-specific demographic, political, socioeconomic, jail and prison population variables, a generalized estimating equations (GEE) model was specified to account for correlations within counties over time

Quantitative Perspectives on Fifty Years of the Journal of the History of Biology (B. R. Erick Peirson - 5 October, 2017)
In this paper, we present a new dataset and preliminary quantitative analysis of the thematic content of JHB from the perspectives of geography, organisms, and thematic fields. The geographic diversity of authors whose work appears in JHB has increased steadily since 1968, but the geographic coverage of the content of JHB articles remains strongly lopsided toward the United States, United Kingdom, and western Europe and has diversified much less dramatically over time. The taxonomic diversity of organisms discussed in JHB increased steadily between 1968 and the late 1990s but declined in later years, mirroring broader patterns of diversification previously reported in the biomedical research literature

Instead, we leverage functional data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project (ACLED) dataset that, inter alia, meticulously catalogues violent extremist incidents in North and West Africa since 1997, to generate a network whose nodes are administrative regions

Census Tract License Areas: Disincentive for Sharing the 3.5GHz band? (Elma Avdic - 30 May, 2016)

The corrective is necessary since the main goal of promoting innovative sharing in 3.5 GHz band is to put spectrum to more efficient use.

Realspace Sovereigns in Cyberspace: The Case of Domain Names (R. Polk Wagner - 26 October, 2001)
We argue that the regulatory significance of geography, and the essentially arbitrary nature of the present territorial locations of the key components of the domain name system implies the future segmentation of the domain name system, and the resulting dramatic decrease in its value
