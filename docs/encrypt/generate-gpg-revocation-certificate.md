If your GPG private key becomes compromised, you need to revoke it to warn others not to trust future signatures or encrypt data to your public key. However, by the time a key compromise happens, you might not have your GPG key available, such as if it resided on hardware stolen from you, or the attacker removed it after accessing it. This article shows you how to generate and preserve a revocation certificate now, before you actually need it.

A revocation certificate consists of a signed message, stating in machine-readable form that a key no longer has validity for future cryptographic operations. To generate a revocation certificate for a key, use the --gen-revoke option to gpg, passing it the key ID of the key you want a revocation certificate for. You should also supply the --output option to specify where to put the certificate. The exchange with gpg looks like this:
