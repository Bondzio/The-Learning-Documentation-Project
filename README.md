*This documentation is about the new learning(s) and issue(s) resolvings on different aspects of academic, professional and personal thoughts.* 

It includes(or/with links): *Personal Public thoughts, Artciles, Research topics(& resources), Programming(issues and code),  Advanced Linux commands, Networking* 
*commands, bash script command utilization, Linux packages(& scripts), Machine learning, text documentation, images, tutorial(links) and gitlab links(Personal Pubic repository links).*

Note : *This documentation is mainly intend to reduce time consumption for solving some issues which are already solved/used earlier, This is from my past experience of wasting my time for searching for issues solving* -- by @gorlapraveen
