GNUzilla is the GNU version of the Mozilla suite, and GNU IceCat is the GNU version
of the Firefox browser. Its main advantage is an ethical one: it is entirely free
software. While the Firefox source code from the Mozilla project is free software, 
they distribute and recommend non-free software as plug-ins and addons. 
Also their trademark license imposes requirements for the distribution of modified 
versions that make it inconvenient to exercise freedom 3.
