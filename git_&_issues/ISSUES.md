## Git Issues :

`error: insufficient permission for adding an object to repository database .git/objects`





It came down to a couple of items that I can see right now.

        git gc --aggressive
        Opening up file permissions to 777

There has to be something else going on, but this was the things that clearly made the biggest impact.
